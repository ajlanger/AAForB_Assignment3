Played by [[Darren Criss]], Blaine was introduced in the [[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|sixth episode]] of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] as the [[openly gay]] lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Blaine initially served as a mentor for New Directions member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]). Chemistry between the two, combined with fan support for the couple, led series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] to pair them romantically. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=\"NYP\"/> At the beginning of the third season, Blaine transfers to McKinley High and joins New Directions; concurrently, Criss was promoted from recurring guest star to the show's main cast.\n\nCriss auditioned for ''Glee'' several times before being cast as Blaine, including for the lead role of [[Finn Hudson]]. He believed he would be ill-suited to that character, but identifies with Blaine, having been raised among the \"gay community\".<ref name=\"kurt's new squeeze\"/> He plays Blaine as charismatic and confident, and finds his youthful self-acceptance a fitting counterpoint to common media portrayals of gay characters.\n\nAs the Warblers' lead vocalist and subsequent New Directions member, Blaine has performed a number of songs on the television series. His first, a [[cover version]] of \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\" by [[Katy Perry]], became the fastest-selling ''Glee'' single, reached number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was certified gold in the U.S.<ref name=\"bill20101127\"/><ref name=\"riaa\"/> Tracks by the Warblers have sold over 1.3&nbsp;million copies. The songs became popular enough to warrant a Warbler soundtrack album, ''[[Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers]]''. Blaine has received mostly positive reviews from critics; Criss has been awarded a Rising Star accolade from the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association for his portrayal. While the Blaine\u2013Kurt (\"Klaine\") relationship has been met with acclaim, an episode storyline in which Blaine questioned his sexuality attracted negative reviews for undermining his previous characterization as a confident gay teenager.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Season 2===\nBlaine Anderson is introduced in the episode \"[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]\" as the lead soloist of the Dalton Academy Warblers [[a cappella]] musical group, and honestly changed Glee for the better. He meets [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), a member of the rival [[glee club]] New Directions. When Kurt asks if Blaine is gay, Blaine matter-of-factly says he is; Kurt tells Blaine that he is being bullied at school for being gay, and Blaine reveals that he too was harassed at his old school, so he transferred to Dalton Academy, which enforces a no-bullying policy. Blaine befriends Kurt, and helps him stand up to his tormentor, [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]).<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/11/glee_recap_teenage_dream.html|title=Glee Recap: Teenage Dream|date=November 10, 2010|first=Rebecca|last=Milzoff|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-NeverBeenKissed\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1133366p1.html|title=Glee: \"Never Been Kissed\" Review|date=November 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Canning|publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref> When the threats and violence against Kurt reach a dangerous level, he transfers to Dalton Academy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Canning|url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1136637p1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Glee: \"Furt\" Review&nbsp;\u2014 TV Review at IGN|work=[[IGN]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref> He falls in love with Blaine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/glee-review-a-very-glee-christmas/|title=Glee Review: You're a Sweet One, Sue the Grinch|work=TV Fanatic|first=Matt|last=Richenthal|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> who is initially oblivious to Kurt's feelings even as their friendship grows.

They start off living together, but though they remain engaged, Blaine ultimately moves out because the two of them realize they still need their own space. The relationship between them goes through rocky patches, including Blaine's insecurity when Kurt becomes popular at school, and when an influential socialite and NYADA supporter hears Blaine perform and takes an interest in his future career, though she is not impressed by Kurt and ultimately tries to break them up, though she fails and ultimately supports them both. Their engagement is strengthened by having weathered these storms, and Blaine moves back in with Kurt.\n\n=== Season 6===\nBlaine returns to Lima after Kurt ended their engagement, having become so despondent that his schoolwork suffered and he was cut by NYADA. He becomes the coach of the Dalton Academy Warblers, and begins dating Dave Karofsky after a chance encounter at the local gay bar.

In \"[[The Hurt Locker, Part Two]]\", Sue, who \"ships Klaine\" and is desperate for Kurt and Blaine to reunite, locks them both in a fake elevator and refuses to let them leave until they kiss. After resisting for a great many hours, Blaine and Kurt share a passionate kiss, but do not reunite afterward. In \"[[Transitioning (Glee)|Transitioning]]\", Blaine sings a duet with Kurt, \"Somebody Loves You\", and afterward, kisses Kurt. The following day, Blaine, knowing that he is still in love with Kurt, breaks up with Karofsky; however, Kurt is still seeing an older man, Walter. In \"[[A Wedding (Glee)|A Wedding]]\", Kurt tells Walter that he is going to Brittany and Santana's wedding with Blaine, not him, and on Walter's advice, returns to Blaine; the two again become a couple. At the wedding, Brittany insists that Kurt and Blaine get married alongside her and Santana. Though skeptical at first, Kurt and Blaine agree and get married, with Burt officiating the joint ceremony. Dalton Academy burns down in \"[[The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester]]\", and the Warblers who transfer to McKinley are accepted into New Directions, with Blaine joining Rachel and Kurt as the coaches of the combined glee club. In the series finale, \"[[Dreams Come True (Glee)|Dreams Come True]]\", after New Directions wins Nationals, Blaine and Kurt leave for New York, with Blaine attending [[New York University|NYU]] and Kurt returning to NYADA along with a reinstated Rachel.

Played by [[Darren Criss]], Blaine was introduced in the [[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|sixth episode]] of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] as the [[openly gay]] lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Blaine initially served as a mentor for New Directions member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]). Chemistry between the two, combined with fan support for the couple, led series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] to pair them romantically. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=\"NYP\"/> At the beginning of the third season, Blaine transfers to McKinley High and joins New Directions; concurrently, Criss was promoted from recurring guest star to the show's main cast.\n\nCriss auditioned for ''Glee'' several times before being cast as Blaine, including for the lead role of [[Finn Hudson]]. He believed he would be ill-suited to that character, but identifies with Blaine, having been raised among the \"gay community\".<ref name=\"kurt's new squeeze\"/> He plays Blaine as charismatic and confident, and finds his youthful self-acceptance a fitting counterpoint to common media portrayals of gay characters.\n\nAs the Warblers' lead vocalist and subsequent New Directions member, Blaine has performed a number of songs on the television series. His first, a [[cover version]] of \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\" by [[Katy Perry]], became the fastest-selling ''Glee'' single, reached number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was certified gold in the U.S.<ref name=\"bill20101127\"/><ref name=\"riaa\"/> Tracks by the Warblers have sold over 1.3&nbsp;million copies. The songs became popular enough to warrant a Warbler soundtrack album, ''[[Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers]]''. Blaine has received mostly positive reviews from critics; Criss has been awarded a Rising Star accolade from the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association for his portrayal. While the Blaine\u2013Kurt (\"Klaine\") relationship has been met with acclaim, an episode storyline in which Blaine questioned his sexuality attracted negative reviews for undermining his previous characterization as a confident gay teenager.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Season 2===\nBlaine Anderson is introduced in the episode \"[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]\" as the lead soloist of the Dalton Academy Warblers [[a cappella]] musical group, and honestly changed Glee for the better. He meets [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), a member of the rival [[glee club]] New Directions. When Kurt asks if Blaine is gay, Blaine matter-of-factly says he is; Kurt tells Blaine that he is being bullied at school for being gay, and Blaine reveals that he too was harassed at his old school, so he transferred to Dalton Academy, which enforces a no-bullying policy. Blaine befriends Kurt, and helps him stand up to his tormentor, [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]).<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/11/glee_recap_teenage_dream.html|title=Glee Recap: Teenage Dream|date=November 10, 2010|first=Rebecca|last=Milzoff|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-NeverBeenKissed\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1133366p1.html|title=Glee: \"Never Been Kissed\" Review|date=November 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Canning|publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref> When the threats and violence against Kurt reach a dangerous level, he transfers to Dalton Academy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Canning|url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1136637p1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Glee: \"Furt\" Review&nbsp;\u2014 TV Review at IGN|work=[[IGN]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref> He falls in love with Blaine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/glee-review-a-very-glee-christmas/|title=Glee Review: You're a Sweet One, Sue the Grinch|work=TV Fanatic|first=Matt|last=Richenthal|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> who is initially oblivious to Kurt's feelings even as their friendship grows.

Blaine still wants to marry Kurt, and stages an elaborate and successful marriage proposal at Dalton Academy where he and Kurt first met, accompanied by New Directions, and all their rival show choir groups, including the Warblers. He auditions for NYADA and is accepted. New Directions comes in second at Nationals, and is disbanded by Sue for not being champions. Blaine graduates as class valedictorian, and then moves to New York to be with Kurt. They start off living together, but though they remain engaged, Blaine ultimately moves out because the two of them realize they still need their own space. The relationship between them goes through rocky patches, including Blaine's insecurity when Kurt becomes popular at school, and when an influential socialite and NYADA supporter hears Blaine perform and takes an interest in his future career, though she is not impressed by Kurt and ultimately tries to break them up, though she fails and ultimately supports them both. Their engagement is strengthened by having weathered these storms, and Blaine moves back in with Kurt.\n\n=== Season 6===\nBlaine returns to Lima after Kurt ended their engagement, having become so despondent that his schoolwork suffered and he was cut by NYADA. He becomes the coach of the Dalton Academy Warblers, and begins dating Dave Karofsky after a chance encounter at the local gay bar. Kurt, having realized he still loves Blaine and regretting that he ended the engagement, arranges for his NYADA off-campus semester to be in Lima, helping Rachel to coach a reinstated New Directions\u2014Will had left McKinley High to coach Vocal Adrenaline. Unfortunately, by the time he arrives, Blaine and Karofsky are already a couple, and there is further strain between Kurt and Blaine as coaches of rival show choirs. In \"[[The Hurt Locker, Part Two]]\", Sue, who \"ships Klaine\" and is desperate for Kurt and Blaine to reunite, locks them both in a fake elevator and refuses to let them leave until they kiss. After resisting for a great many hours, Blaine and Kurt share a passionate kiss, but do not reunite afterward. In \"[[Transitioning (Glee)|Transitioning]]\", Blaine sings a duet with Kurt, \"Somebody Loves You\", and afterward, kisses Kurt. The following day, Blaine, knowing that he is still in love with Kurt, breaks up with Karofsky; however, Kurt is still seeing an older man, Walter. In \"[[A Wedding (Glee)|A Wedding]]\", Kurt tells Walter that he is going to Brittany and Santana's wedding with Blaine, not him, and on Walter's advice, returns to Blaine; the two again become a couple. At the wedding, Brittany insists that Kurt and Blaine get married alongside her and Santana. Though skeptical at first, Kurt and Blaine agree and get married, with Burt officiating the joint ceremony. Dalton Academy burns down in \"[[The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester]]\", and the Warblers who transfer to McKinley are accepted into New Directions, with Blaine joining Rachel and Kurt as the coaches of the combined glee club. In the series finale, \"[[Dreams Come True (Glee)|Dreams Come True]]\", after New Directions wins Nationals, Blaine and Kurt leave for New York, with Blaine attending [[New York University|NYU]] and Kurt returning to NYADA along with a reinstated Rachel. The episode jumps ahead to 2020, and Blaine and Kurt are shown to be actors and a celebrity married couple; they also visit schools to entertain and talk about acceptance.
