A [[Chain smoking|chain smoker]], he was likened to TV police detective Lieutenant [[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]. He was the father of the referee [[Guy Goethals]], who officiated at the [[UEFA Euro 96|1996 European Championships]].\n\n==Playing career and early coaching career==\nGoethals began his career as a goalkeeper in the 1930s with [[R. Daring Club Molenbeek|Daring Brussels]], making his way through the youth ranks of the club before joining Racing Club Brussel in 1947. He remained at Racing Club Brussel until 1948. After a period spent playing for Renaisi\u00e8nne, he moved into coaching with Hannutois and Waremme, and led [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]] to second place in the [[Belgian First Division]] in 1966.\n\n===Belgium national coach===\nGoethals took charge of the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national side]] in 1968. Belgium would succeed in qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in [[Mexico]], although they were eliminated in the first round of the tournament. Belgium hosted the [[1972 UEFA European Football Championship|1972 European Championship]], having knocked out holders [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the qualifying stages, and defeated [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the match for third place after losing in the semi-final to eventual tournament winners [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. That marked Goethals' greatest success as national team coach. He also took great pride in the fact that Belgium had held the emergent [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] scoreless in both their meetings in [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|1974 World Cup qualifying]]. Belgium completed their qualifying campaign without having conceded a single goal, but lost out to the Netherlands on account of their inferior goal difference.\n\n===Return to club coaching===\nIn 1976 Goethals' tenure as coach of the national side ended, and he joined [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] as coach. In his first season, Anderlecht reached the final of the [[1977 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]], where they lost to German side [[Hamburger SV]], but won the trophy the following year with a comprehensive victory over [[FK Austria Wien|FK Austria/WAC]]. After spells coaching in France at [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and in Brazil with [[S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube|S\u00e3o Paulo]], Goethals returned to Belgium to coach [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]]. Standard Li\u00e8ge were Belgian champions in 1982 and 1983, and they reached the [[1982 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|Cup Winners' Cup Final]] in 1982, losing to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], who were at a considerable advantage in that the final was played at their home ground, [[Camp Nou]].\n\n===Controversy and Goethals' return to Anderlecht===\nStandard Li\u00e8ge's 1982 championship win was to become the subject of great controversy in 1984. Seemingly preoccupied with winning his first Belgian title, Goethals had suggested and initiated the bribing of the Waterschei players prior to the teams' meeting in the final match of the season, in order to secure championship honours for Standard Li\u00e8ge and ensure that none of his players would miss their European final against Barcelona through injury. Goethals was forced to resign in the wake of the scandal, and he moved to Portugal to take charge of [[Vit\u00f3ria S.C.|Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es]]. He then returned to Belgium to coach [[R. Jet Wavre|Racing Jet de Bruxelles]] before a second spell in charge of Anderlecht, where he won [[Belgian Cup]] trophy in 1989. [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] again recruited Goethals, and they finished runners-up in the [[Ligue 1|French championship]] in [[1989\u201390 French Division 1|1989\u201390]] behind [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. Approaching 70 years of age, Goethals' greatest triumph as a coach was yet to come.\n\n===Olympique de Marseille===\nIn 1990, Goethals was named coach of [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and was entrusted with the task of leading the club to [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] success. In his first season, the club narrowly missed out on European glory, losing on penalties in the [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]] to [[Red Star Belgrade]]. There was recognition for Goethals' coaching abilities, as he was voted 1991 European Coach of the Year. In 1993, Marseille again reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|final]], where they defeated favourites [[A.C. Milan]] with a headed goal by [[Basile Boli]]. Having achieved his primary objective at Marseille, Goethals left the club.\n\nMarseille were later stripped of their [[1992\u201393 French Division 1|1993]] French championship when it emerged that three [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]] players had been offered money to underperform in a crucial match against Marseille. The club were not allowed to defend their European title as a result, and were punished with relegation to the French [[Ligue 2|second division]].\n\n==Retirement==\nGoethals' coaching career ended at Anderlecht in season 1995\u201396, but he remained in demand as a television analyst for his insights into football. He died of bowel cancer aged 83. In 2005, the year following his death, he was voted 38th in [[De Grootste Belg]], a Flemish television programme based on the [[BBC]]'s [[100 Greatest Britons]]. The number 2 stand at [[F. C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek|F.C. Brussels]]' home ground, [[Edmond Machtens Stadium]], was renamed in honour of Goethals in late 2005. He remains today as the oldest winning manager of [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n==Honours==\n===Manager===\n'''Anderlecht''' \n*[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]: [[1977\u201378 European Cup Winners' Cup|1977\u201378]]\n*[[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]]: [[1976 European Super Cup|1976]], [[1978 European Super Cup|1978]]\n*[[Belgian Cup]]: 1988\u201389\n\n'''Standard Li\u00e8ge'''\n*[[Belgian Pro League|Belgian First Division]]: [[1981\u201382 Belgian First Division|1981\u201382]], [[1982\u201383 Belgian First Division|1982\u201383]]\n*[[Belgian Super Cup]]: 1981, 1983\n\n''Marseille'''' \n*[[Ligue 1|French Division 1]]: [[1990\u201391 French Division 1|1990\u201391]], [[1991\u201392 French Division 1|1991\u201392]]\n*[[UEFA Champions League]]: [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393]]\n\n'''Belgium'''\n*[[UEFA Euro 1972]]: Third place\n\n===Individual===\n*[[Albo Panchina d'Oro|Panchina d'Oro]]: 1990\u201391<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleniamo.com/comunicati/2010/febbraio/panchina_oro_allegri.htm|title=Albo \"Panchina d'Oro\"|publisher=Alleniamo.com|language=Italian|accessdate=25 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113036/http://www.alleniamo.com/comunicati/2010/febbraio/panchina_oro_allegri.htm|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n*[[France Football]] 47th Greatest Manager of All Time: 2019<ref name=\"FOXSports\">{{cite web |url=https://www.foxsports.com.mx/news/400382-los--mejores-entrenadores-de-la-historia|title=Los 50 mejores entrenadores de la historia|publisher=[[FOX Sports]] |date=19 March 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ABCes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.es/deportes/futbol/abci-50-mejores-entrenadores-historia-futbol-201903191710_noticia.html|title=Los 50 mejores entrenadores de la historia del f\u00fatbol|publisher=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |date=19 March 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010330/http://raymondgoethals.be/ Raymond Goethals on www.belgium.be in Dutch/French and English]\n* [http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=265278.html Raymond Goethals' obituary on UEFA.com]\n* [http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/organisation/history/obituaries/newsid=265401.html The magician remembered' by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com]\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title = Belgium squads\n|bg = #d4071a\n|fg = #ffce4a\n|bordercolor = Black\n|list1 =\n{{Belgium squad 1970 FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Belgium squad UEFA Euro 1972}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Awards\n|bg=gold\n|fg=navy\n|list1=\n{{European Cup / Champions League winning managers}}\n{{UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winning managers}}\n{{Ligue 1 winning managers}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Managerial positions\n|list1=\n{{K.
