The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on January&nbsp;11, 1988. This was the second writing credit of the series for [[Tracy Torm\u00e9]] following the episode \"[[Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Haven]]\". [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] planned to direct the episode, but he was switched to \"[[Datalore]]\" due to delays in its production. With Bowman working on another episode, [[Joseph L. Scanlan]] became the director.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, the crew is sent to open diplomatic ties with the Jarada. While taking a break from preparations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), Lt. Cmdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]), and Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) are trapped, due to a computer malfunction, in a 1940s-style gangster [[holodeck]] program with Captain Picard playing the role of [[detective]] Dixon Hill.\n\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is the first episode to significantly feature the holodeck. Torm\u00e9 credited [[Gene Roddenberry]] with the idea for the detective novel, with Torm\u00e9 employing the [[film noir]] style using references to ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941). [[Lawrence Tierney]], who appeared in film noir movies in the 1940s, guest stars as Cyrus Redblock. The Dixon Hill setting reappeared in two later episodes in the series and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996).\n\n11.5&nbsp;million viewers watched \"The Big Goodbye\"; critical reception was mixed. One reviewer found it too similar to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]\". Other reviewers complained about the holodeck but praised Tierney's performance. The episode won an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series|Outstanding Costumes for a Series]] and is the only ''Star Trek'' episode to ever win the [[Peabody Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] heads to Torona IV to open negotiations with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock ([[Lawrence Tierney]]) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen ([[David Selburg]]) to join him in the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary ([[Gary Armagnac]]) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the ''Enterprise'' is scanned from a distance by the Jarada, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.\n\nThe Jarada demand their greeting earlier than the agreed time and are insulted at having to talk to anyone other than the Captain. The crew try to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but find it impossible; the Jarada signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) and [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) attempt to repair the holodeck systems, while inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech ([[Harvey Jason]]) appears having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover the holodeck is malfunctioning and they are unable to exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.\n\nOutside, Wesley finds the glitch, however he cannot simply turn off the system for fear of losing everyone inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and the others in the middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is \"the big goodbye\", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.\n\n==Production==\n[[image:MainTitleMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|References were deliberately included in \"The Big Goodbye\" to the 1941 film ''The Maltese Falcon''.]]\nThe initial idea for Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and other writing staff.

However, the name was changed due to similarities with the name of the title character in the American television series ''[[Remington Steele]]''. The episode's name is itself a reference to two works by [[detective fiction]] writer [[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]''.

While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary ([[Gary Armagnac]]) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the ''Enterprise'' is scanned from a distance by the Jarada, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.\n\nThe Jarada demand their greeting earlier than the agreed time and are insulted at having to talk to anyone other than the Captain. The crew try to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but find it impossible; the Jarada signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) and [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) attempt to repair the holodeck systems, while inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech ([[Harvey Jason]]) appears having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover the holodeck is malfunctioning and they are unable to exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.\n\nOutside, Wesley finds the glitch, however he cannot simply turn off the system for fear of losing everyone inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and the others in the middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is \"the big goodbye\", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.\n\n==Production==\n[[image:MainTitleMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|References were deliberately included in \"The Big Goodbye\" to the 1941 film ''The Maltese Falcon''.]]\nThe initial idea for Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and other writing staff.

However, the name was changed due to similarities with the name of the title character in the American television series ''[[Remington Steele]]''. The episode's name is itself a reference to two works by [[detective fiction]] writer [[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]''.
