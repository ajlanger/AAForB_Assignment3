Roehampton's most densely populated area has a long border with the largest of London's [[Royal Parks]], Richmond Park.

Several of the original houses survive. [[Roehampton House]] (grade I) by [[Thomas Archer]] was built between 1710\u201312 and enlarged by [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]] in 1910. [[Parkstead House]] (grade I) built in 1750 for [[William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough]], now forms part of the [[University of Roehampton]].

The land was previously the estates of two large houses, ''Dover House'' and ''Putney Park House'', which were purchased by the [[London County Council|LCC]] soon after [[World War I]]. Dover House was demolished for the new estate, but [[Putney Park House]] remains. The common characteristic of the LCC cottage estates is picturesque housing influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style.  It was the intention at Dover House Estate to create housing in groups that overlooked or had access to open space, to provide a sense of intimacy and individuality, and the estate was laid out with communal green spaces. Allotments were also provided in three backland areas behind houses, two of which remain, the third subsequently infilled by housing.\n\n[[File:Alton Estate Roehampton London.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Some of the many high-rise blocks which are part of the large [[Alton Estate]]]]\nThe notable [[Alton Estate]], one of the largest council estates in the UK, occupies an extensive swathe of land west of Roehampton village and runs between the Roehampton Lane through-road and Richmond Park Golf Courses, as can be seen on the map above.

Roehampton House was built in 1710 and was until 2008 the administrative centre for [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton|Queen Mary's Hospital]]. It is now being developed into private flats. Parkstead House was built in 1763 by the second Earl of Bessborough, and was the home of the socialite [[Caroline Lamb]] before being acquired in 1861 for use as a seminary by the Jesuits and renamed Manresa House. [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], the Jesuit poet, lived there. Many other 18th-century aristocratic summer villas were set in parkland near Richmond Park and Putney Heath. Parkstead (Manresa) House, Downshire House, Grove House and [[Mount Clare (Roehampton)|Mount Clare]] are now all part of the [[University of Roehampton]] campus. Much of the old village of Roehampton still remains dominated by large detached houses. An old watering trough for Victorian carriage-horses exists at the junction of Medfield Street and Roehampton Lane.

It has long been a major centre for teacher-training, being the site of two constituent colleges ([[Digby Stuart College]] and [[Froebel College]]) of the former federal Roehampton Institute of Higher Education (now the University of Roehampton), as well as [[South East England]]'s only lecturer-training college ([[Garnett College]]) which eventually moved and became part of the [[University of Greenwich]].\n\nApart from education other notable institutions based here include: [[Priory Hospital|The Priory]] Clinic; the [[Bank of England]] Sports Centre; [[Rosslyn Park F.C.|Rosslyn Park]] Rugby Football Club; and the [[Roehampton Club]].
