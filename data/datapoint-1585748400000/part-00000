Some are also [[National Scenic Byway]]s or [[National Forest Scenic Byways]]. The program was initiated in 1989, and since then, 54&nbsp;byways have been designated in the Western United States.<ref name=BLMBP/> Each byway is classified into one of four types based on the vehicles that can traverse it.\n\n*Type I\u2014Roads are paved or have an all weather surface and have grades that are negotiable by a normal touring car. These roads are usually narrow, slow speed, secondary roads.\n*Type II\u2014Roads require high-clearance vehicles such as trucks or 4-wheel drives. These roads are usually not paved, but may have some type of surfacing. Grades, curves, and road surface are such that they can be negotiated with a 2-wheel drive high clearance vehicle without undue difficulty.\n*Type III\u2014 Roads require 4-wheel drive vehicles or other specialized vehicles such as dirt bikes, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), etc. These roads are usually not surfaced, but are managed to provide for safety considerations and resource protection needs. They have grades, tread surfaces, and other characteristics that will require specialized vehicles to negotiate.\n*Type IV\u2014Trails that are managed specifically to accommodate dirt bike, mountain bike, snowmobile, or ATV use. These are usually single track trails.<ref name=types>{{cite report |author= Bureau of Land Management |date= June 30, 2004 |title= Table 1: Bureau of Land Management BLM Scenic and/or Back Country Byway (BCB) Roster (As of 6/30/04) |url= http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/recreation_images/national_programs/byways.Par.26197.File.dat/Table%201.pdf |format= PDF |page= 1 |publisher= Bureau of Land Management |accessdate= June 15, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194252/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/recreation_images/national_programs/byways.Par.26197.File.dat/Table%201.pdf |archivedate= January 2, 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n__TOC__{{clear}}\n\n==List==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s).|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor= ffdead align=center | III\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway]]\n|{{convert|0|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|\n|\n| {{dts| September 22, 1989}}\n| This route winds its way to an elevation of {{convert|12,800|ft}}, crossing [[Engineer Pass|Engineer]] and [[Cinnamon Pass|Cinnamon]] passes.

Some are also [[National Scenic Byway]]s or [[National Forest Scenic Byways]]. The program was initiated in 1989, and since then, 54&nbsp;byways have been designated in the Western United States.<ref name=BLMBP/> Each byway is classified into one of four types based on the vehicles that can traverse it.\n\n*Type I\u2014Roads are paved or have an all weather surface and have grades that are negotiable by a normal touring car. These roads are usually narrow, slow speed, secondary roads.\n*Type II\u2014Roads require high-clearance vehicles such as trucks or 4-wheel drives. These roads are usually not paved, but may have some type of surfacing. Grades, curves, and road surface are such that they can be negotiated with a 2-wheel drive high clearance vehicle without undue difficulty.\n*Type III\u2014 Roads require 4-wheel drive vehicles or other specialized vehicles such as dirt bikes, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), etc. These roads are usually not surfaced, but are managed to provide for safety considerations and resource protection needs. They have grades, tread surfaces, and other characteristics that will require specialized vehicles to negotiate.\n*Type IV\u2014Trails that are managed specifically to accommodate dirt bike, mountain bike, snowmobile, or ATV use. These are usually single track trails.<ref name=types>{{cite report |author= Bureau of Land Management |date= June 30, 2004 |title= Table 1: Bureau of Land Management BLM Scenic and/or Back Country Byway (BCB) Roster (As of 6/30/04) |url= http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/recreation_images/national_programs/byways.Par.26197.File.dat/Table%201.pdf |format= PDF |page= 1 |publisher= Bureau of Land Management |accessdate= June 15, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194252/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/recreation_images/national_programs/byways.Par.26197.File.dat/Table%201.pdf |archivedate= January 2, 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n__TOC__{{clear}}\n\n==List==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s).|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor= ffdead align=center | III\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway]]\n|{{convert|0|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|\n|\n| {{dts| September 22, 1989}}\n| This route winds its way to an elevation of {{convert|12,800|ft}}, crossing [[Engineer Pass|Engineer]] and [[Cinnamon Pass|Cinnamon]] passes.
