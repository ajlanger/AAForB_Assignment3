He studied with [[Peter Dreher]] and [[Horst Antes]] end of the 1960s. His works incorporate materials such as [[straw]], [[wiktionary:ash|ash]], [[clay]], lead, and [[shellac]]. The poems of [[Paul Celan]] have played a role in developing Kiefer's themes of German history and the horror of [[the Holocaust]], as have the spiritual concepts of [[Kabbalah]].\n\nIn his entire body of work, Kiefer argues with the past and addresses [[taboo]] and controversial issues from recent history. Themes from [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] are particularly reflected in his work; for instance, the painting \"Margarethe\" (oil and straw on canvas) was inspired by [[Paul Celan]]'s well-known poem \"''[[Todesfuge]]''\" (\"''Death Fugue''\").\n\nHis works are characterised by an unflinching willingness to confront his culture's dark past, and unrealised potential, in works that are often done on a large, confrontational scale well suited to the subjects. It is also characteristic of his work to find signatures and/or names of people of historical importance, legendary figures or historical places. All of these are encoded [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] through which Kiefer seeks to process the past; this has resulted in his work being linked with the movements ''New Symbolism'' and ''Neo\u2013Expressionism''.<ref name=big>''Big Questions'', [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]], September 2006, p. 33</ref>\n\nKiefer has lived and worked in France since 1992.

His city having been heavily bombed, Kiefer grew up surrounded by the devastation of the war. In 1951, his family moved to [[Ottersdorf]], and he attended public school in [[Rastatt]], graduating high school in 1965. He studied at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]], studying pre-law and [[Romance languages]]. However, after 3 semesters he switched to art, studying at art academies in [[Freiburg]] and [[Karlsruhe]]. In Karlsruhe, he studied under [[Peter Dreher]], a [[realism (arts)|realist]] and figurative painter.<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Anselm%20Kiefer&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 Anselm Kiefer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013316/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Anselm%20Kiefer&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 |date=April 29, 2011 }} Guggenheim Collection.</ref> He received an art degree in 1969.<ref name=big/>\n\nIn 1971 Kiefer moved to [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] and established a studio. He remained there until 1992; his output during this first creative time is known as ''The German Years''.  In 1992 he relocated to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nKiefer left his first wife and children in Germany on his move to Barjac in 1992.

In his middle years, his inspiration came from literary figures, namely [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. His later works incorporate themes from [[Judeo-Christian]], ancient Egyptian, and Oriental cultures, which he combines with other motifs. [[Cosmogony]] is also a large focus in his works. In all, Kiefer searches for the meaning of existence and \"representation of the incomprehensible and the non-representational.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Anselm Kiefer|date=2019-04-07|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anselm_Kiefer&oldid=187321705|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2019|certain=y}}\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nKiefer values a \"spiritual connection\" with the materials he works with, \"extracting the spirit that already lives within [them].\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In doing so, he transforms his materials with acid baths and physical blows with sticks and axes, among other processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Pete|date=|title=How I Challenge the Canons With My Four German Ghost Dissenters|url=|journal=Journal of Artists' Books|volume=38|pages=19\u201320|via=Columbia Chicago Center for Book & Paper Arts}}</ref>\n\nHe often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014[[lead]] in particular. Kiefer's initial attraction to lead arose when he had to repair aging pipes in the first house he owned. Eventually, he came to admire its physical and sensory qualities and began to discover more about its connection to [[alchemy]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Physically, Kiefer specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he sees many colors, especially gold, which he associates to the symbolic gold sought by alchemists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Albano|first=Albert P.|date=1998|title=Reflections on Painting, Alchemy, Nazism: Visiting with Anselm Kiefer|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=3|pages=348\u2013361|doi=10.2307/3179818|issn=0197-1360|jstor=3179818}}</ref>\n\nKiefer's use of straw in his work represents energy. He claims this is due to straw's physical qualities, including the color gold and its release of energy and heat when burned. The resulting ash makes way for new creation, thus echoing the motifs of transformation and the cycle of life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nKiefer also values the balance between order and chaos in his work, stating, \"[I]f there is too much order, [the piece] is dead; or if there is much chaos, it doesn't cohere.\" In addition, he cares deeply about the space in which his works reside. He states that his works \"lose their power completely\" if put in the wrong spaces. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Karen|date=November 2006|title=The Ruins of Barjac: Politics, alchemy, and learning to dance in Anselm Kiefer's world|url=|journal=Modern Painters|volume=|pages=68\u201375|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[Image:Anselm Kieffer - 'Glaube , Hoffnung, Liebe'.JPG|thumb|right|''Faith, Hope, love'' by Anselm Kiefer]]\n===Photography===\nKiefer began his career creating performances and documenting them in photographs titled ''Occupations and Heroische Sinnbilder (Heroic Symbols)''.  Dressed in his father's [[Wehrmacht]] uniform, Kiefer mimicked the [[Nazi salute]] in various locations in France, Switzerland and Italy. He asked Germans to remember and to acknowledge the loss to their culture through the mad [[xenophobia]] of the [[Third Reich]].

He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The use of these materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials in such a way that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and carpet felt in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nKiefer returned to the area of his birthplace in 1971. In the years that followed, he incorporated German mythology in particular in his work, and in the next decade he studied the [[Kabbalah]], as well as [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalists]] like Robert Fludd.<ref name=\"Rumelin\"/> He went on extended journeys throughout Europe, the USA and the Middle East; the latter two journeys further influenced his work. Besides paintings, Kiefer created sculptures, watercolors, photographs, and woodcuts, using woodcuts in particular to create a repertoire of figures he could reuse repeatedly in all media over the next decades, lending his work its knotty thematic coherence.<ref name=Rumelin>R\u00fcmelin, Christian. \"Anselm Kiefer: Rolling on the River Rhine,\" ''Art in Print'' Vol. 8 No. 1 (May\u2013June 2018).</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Kiefer made numerous paintings, watercolors, woodcuts, and books on themes interpreted by [[Richard Wagner]] in his four-opera cycle [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] (The Ring of the Nibelung).<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1995.14.14] Anselm Kiefer, ''My Father Pledged Me a Sword'' (1974\u201375), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York</ref> \n\nIn the early 1980s, he created more than thirty paintings, painted photographs, and watercolors that refer in their titles and inscriptions to the Romanian Jewish writer [[Paul Celan]]'s poem \"Todesfuge\" (\"Death Fugue\").<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.96.7] Anselm Kiefer, ''Your Golden Hair, Margarete'' (1980) Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</ref>\n\nA series of paintings which Kiefer executed between 1980 and 1983 depict looming stone edifices, referring to famous examples of National Socialist architecture, particularly buildings designed by [[Albert Speer]] and [[Wilhelm Kreis]].

Such works, like ''Heavy Cloud'' (1985), were an indirect response to the controversy in West Germany in the early 1980s about NATO's stationing of tactical nuclear missiles on German soil and the placement of nuclear fuel processing facilities.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1995.14.41] Anselm Kiefer, ''Heavy Cloud'' (1985), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on [[Germany]]'s role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involved not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. During the 1980s his paintings became more physical, and featured unusual textures and materials.<ref>[[Sue Hubbard]] (24 October 2008), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/margarete-1981-by-anselm-kiefer-saatchi-collection-970630.html] Margarete (1981) by Anselm Kiefer (Saatchi collection).

Taking over 20 years to create (1971-1991), 20 Years of Solitude is a ceiling-high stack of hundreds of white-painted ledgers and handmade books, strewn with dirt and dried vegetation, whose pages are stained with the artist\u2019s semen. The word solitude in the title references the artists frequent masturbation onto paper during the 20 years it took to create. He asked American art critic Peter Schjeldahl to write a text for a catalog of the masturbation books. Schjeldahl attempted to oblige but ultimately failed in his endeavor. No other critic would take on the task, so the work has largely faded into obscurity.<ref name=Schjeldahl1998>{{cite web|last=Schjeldahl |first=Peter |title=lost in the terrain: anselm kiefer |date=12 February 1998 |url= http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/schjeldahl/schjeldahl2-12-98.asp |publisher=Artnet}}</ref>\n\nHe would shock the art world yet again at a dinner party in May of 1993. Kiefer and his second wife, Renate Graf, decorated a candlelit commercial loft in New York with white muslin, carpeted the floor with white sand, and staffed it with waiters dressed as mimes with white-face. A handful of art world elite, such as the likes of Sherrie Levine, were served several courses of arcane organ meats, such as pancreas, that were mostly white in color. Not surprisingly, the guests did not find the meal to be particularly appetizing. <ref name=Schjeldahl1998 />\n\nSince 2002, Kiefer has worked with concrete, creating the towers destined for the Pirelli warehouses in Milan, the series of tributes to [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] (paintings of the sea, with boats and an array of leaden objects, 2004-5), a return to the work of [[Paul Celan]]<ref>[http://ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan-1] Anselm Kiefer, Thaddaeus Ropac</ref> with a series of paintings featuring rune motifs (2004\u20136), and other sculptures.<ref>[http://archive.monumenta.com/2007/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=9&lang=en]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Anselm Kiefer Biographie, Monumenta 2007, Paris</ref> In 2003, he held his first solo show at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg Villa Katz, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/am-anfang Anselm Kiefer: Am Anfang],'' dedicated to a series of new works, centered on the recurring themes of history and myths. In 2005, he held his second exhibition in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's Salzburg location, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan F\u00fcr Paul Celan],'' which focused on Kiefer's preoccupation with the book, linking references to Germanic mythology with the poetry of Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jew from Czernowitz. The exhibition featured eleven works on canvas, a series of bound books shown in display cases, and five sculptures, including one powerful, monumental outdoor sculpture of reinforced concrete and lead elements, two leaden piles of books combined with bronze sunflowers, lead ships and wedges, and two monumental leaden books from the series The Secret Life of Plants. The exhibition toured to Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris and Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, the following year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2006, Kiefer's exhibition, ''Velimir Chlebnikov'', was first shown in a small studio near Barjac, then moved to [[White Cube]] in London, then finishing in the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]] in Connecticut. The work consists of 30 large (2 x 3 meters) paintings, hanging in two banks of 15 on facing walls of an expressly constructed corrugated steel building that mimics the studio in which they were created. The work refers to the eccentric theories of the [[Russian Futurism|Russian futurist]] philosopher/poet [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velimir Chlebnikov]], who invented a \"language of the future\" called \"Zaum\", and who postulated that cataclysmic sea battles shift the course of history once every 317 years. In his paintings, Kiefer's toy-like battleships\u2014misshapen, battered, rusted and hanging by twisted wires\u2014are cast about by paint and plaster waves. The work's recurrent color notes are black, white, gray, and rust; and their surfaces are rough and slathered with paint, plaster, mud and clay.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Anselm Kiefer at Aldrich Contemporary|author=Robert Ayers|publisher=ARTINFO|date=27 June 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/18155/anselm-kiefer-at-aldrich-contemporary/|accessdate=16 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, he became the first artist to be commissioned to install a permanent work at the [[Louvre]], Paris, since Georges Braque some 50 years earlier. The same year, he inaugurated the Monumenta exhibitions series at the Grand Palais<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandpalais.fr/en/article/monumenta|title=Monumenta|website=www.grandpalais.fr|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> in Paris, with works paying special tribute to the poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann.\n\nIn 2009 Kiefer mounted two exhibitions at the White Cube gallery in London. A series of forest diptychs and triptychs enclosed in glass vitrines, many filled with dense Moroccan thorns, was titled ''Karfunkelfee'', a term from [[German Romanticism]] stemming from a poem by the post-war Austrian writer [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. In ''The Fertile Crescent'', Kiefer presented a group of epic paintings inspired by a trip to India fifteen years earlier where he first encountered rural brick factories. Over the past decade, the photographs that Kiefer took in India \"reverberated\" in his mind to suggest a vast array of cultural and historical references, reaching from the first human civilization of [[Mesopotamia]] to the ruins of Germany in the aftermath of [[World War II|the Second World War]], where he played as a boy. \"Anyone in search of a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur\", wrote the historian [[Simon Schama]] in his catalogue essay, \"would do well to look hard at Kiefer\u2019s ''The Fertile Crescent''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/anselm_kiefer_masons_yard_hoxton_square_2009|title=Anselm Kiefer: Karfunkelfee and The Fertile Crescent|date=16 October 2009|publisher=White Cube}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Morgenthau Plan'' (2012), the gallery is filled with a sculpture of a golden wheat field, enclosed in a five-meter-high steel cage.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/anselm-kiefer--october-19-2012] Anselm Kiefer: Morgenthau Plan, 19 October 2012 \u2013 26 January 2013, Gagosian Gallery, Paris</ref> That same year, Kiefer inaugurated Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's gallery space in Pantin, with an exhibition of monumental new works, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/die-ungeborenen Die Ungeborenen].''

Early examples are typically worked-over photographs; his more recent books consist of sheets of lead layered with paint, minerals, or dried plant matter. For example, he assembled numerous lead books on steel shelves in libraries, as symbols of the stored, discarded knowledge of history.<ref>[http://moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3086] Anselm Kiefer, Museum of Modern Art, New York</ref> The book ''Rhine'' (1981) comprises a sequence of 25 woodcuts that suggest a journey along the [[Rhine]] River; the river is central to Germany's geographical and historical development, acquiring an almost mythic significance in works such as Wagner's [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of the Nibelungs]].

In 1999 the Japan Art Association awarded him the [[Praemium Imperiale]] for his lifetime achievements. In the explanatory statement it reads:\n\n\"A complex critical engagement with history runs through Anselm Kiefer's work. His paintings as well as the sculptures of [[Georg Baselitz]] created an uproar at the 1980 Venice Biennale: the viewers had to decide whether the apparent Nazi motifs were meant ironically or whether the works were meant to convey actual fascist ideas. Kiefer worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatized nation and a vexed, divided world. He created epic paintings on giant canvases that called up the history of German culture with the help of depictions of figures such as [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Goethe]], thus continuing the historical tradition of painting as a medium of addressing the world. Only a few contemporary artists have such a pronounced sense of art's duty to engage the past and the ethical questions of the present, and are in the position to express the possibility of the absolution of guilt through human effort.\"\n\nIn 2008, Kiefer was awarded the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]], given for the first time to a visual artist.

He acknowledges the issue, but says change is part of the process and that their essence will ultimately stay the same. This idea of transformation has a kind of appeal for Kiefer and thus is featured in many of his works. This fascination for the process may have stemmed from the artist\u2019s keen interest in alchemy. He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014lead in particular being chief among them. In the case of lead, he specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he would see many colors\u2014especially that of gold\u2014which he thought of in a symbolic sense as the gold sought by alchemists. He is also particularly fond of the oxidation of white on lead. He would often try to induce oxidation artificially with the use of acid to speed up the process. Lead was also associated with the alchemical concepts of magic numbers and represented the planet Saturn.\n\nShellac, another material popular in his work, corresponded to lead in terms of how he felt about its color and energy possibilities. He also liked that while being polished it takes on energy and becomes warm to the touch.\n\nThe use of straw in his work is also in part the result of this common theme of energy. Straw again features the color gold and gives off energy, heat, and warmth when burned. This would make way for new creation thus continuing the cycle of life through the transformation process.<ref>14</ref>\nIn 2011, [[Christie's]] set a new worldwide record of $3.6&nbsp;million for the artist, when it sold ''To the Unknown Painter'' (1983) to an American private collector.<ref name=\"fever\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holocaust memorial landscapes in Germany]]\n\n==Biography, criticism, catalogues, monographs, documentaries==\n* Alteveer, Ian.

He studied with [[Peter Dreher]] and [[Horst Antes]] end of the 1960s. His works incorporate materials such as [[straw]], [[wiktionary:ash|ash]], [[clay]], lead, and [[shellac]]. The poems of [[Paul Celan]] have played a role in developing Kiefer's themes of German history and the horror of [[the Holocaust]], as have the spiritual concepts of [[Kabbalah]].\n\nIn his entire body of work, Kiefer argues with the past and addresses [[taboo]] and controversial issues from recent history. Themes from [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] are particularly reflected in his work; for instance, the painting \"Margarethe\" (oil and straw on canvas) was inspired by [[Paul Celan]]'s well-known poem \"''[[Todesfuge]]''\" (\"''Death Fugue''\").\n\nHis works are characterised by an unflinching willingness to confront his culture's dark past, and unrealised potential, in works that are often done on a large, confrontational scale well suited to the subjects. It is also characteristic of his work to find signatures and/or names of people of historical importance, legendary figures or historical places. All of these are encoded [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] through which Kiefer seeks to process the past; this has resulted in his work being linked with the movements ''New Symbolism'' and ''Neo\u2013Expressionism''.<ref name=big>''Big Questions'', [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]], September 2006, p. 33</ref>\n\nKiefer has lived and worked in France since 1992.

In 1951, his family moved to [[Ottersdorf]], and he attended public school in [[Rastatt]], graduating high school in 1965. He studied at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]], studying pre-law and [[Romance languages]]. However, after 3 semesters he switched to art, studying at art academies in [[Freiburg]] and [[Karlsruhe]]. In Karlsruhe, he studied under [[Peter Dreher]], a [[realism (arts)|realist]] and figurative painter.<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Anselm%20Kiefer&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 Anselm Kiefer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013316/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Anselm%20Kiefer&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 |date=April 29, 2011 }} Guggenheim Collection.</ref> He received an art degree in 1969.<ref name=big/>\n\nIn 1971 Kiefer moved to [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] and established a studio. He remained there until 1992; his output during this first creative time is known as ''The German Years''.  In 1992 he relocated to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nKiefer left his first wife and children in Germany on his move to Barjac in 1992.

In his middle years, his inspiration came from literary figures, namely [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. His later works incorporate themes from [[Judeo-Christian]], ancient Egyptian, and Oriental cultures, which he combines with other motifs. [[Cosmogony]] is also a large focus in his works. In all, Kiefer searches for the meaning of existence and \"representation of the incomprehensible and the non-representational.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Anselm Kiefer|date=2019-04-07|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anselm_Kiefer&oldid=187321705|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2019|certain=y}}\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nKiefer values a \"spiritual connection\" with the materials he works with, \"extracting the spirit that already lives within [them].\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In doing so, he transforms his materials with acid baths and physical blows with sticks and axes, among other processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Pete|date=|title=How I Challenge the Canons With My Four German Ghost Dissenters|url=|journal=Journal of Artists' Books|volume=38|pages=19\u201320|via=Columbia Chicago Center for Book & Paper Arts}}</ref>\n\nHe often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014[[lead]] in particular. Kiefer's initial attraction to lead arose when he had to repair aging pipes in the first house he owned. Eventually, he came to admire its physical and sensory qualities and began to discover more about its connection to [[alchemy]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Physically, Kiefer specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he sees many colors, especially gold, which he associates to the symbolic gold sought by alchemists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Albano|first=Albert P.|date=1998|title=Reflections on Painting, Alchemy, Nazism: Visiting with Anselm Kiefer|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=3|pages=348\u2013361|doi=10.2307/3179818|issn=0197-1360|jstor=3179818}}</ref>\n\nKiefer's use of straw in his work represents energy. He claims this is due to straw's physical qualities, including the color gold and its release of energy and heat when burned. The resulting ash makes way for new creation, thus echoing the motifs of transformation and the cycle of life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nKiefer also values the balance between order and chaos in his work, stating, \"[I]f there is too much order, [the piece] is dead; or if there is much chaos, it doesn't cohere.\" In addition, he cares deeply about the space in which his works reside. He states that his works \"lose their power completely\" if put in the wrong spaces. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Karen|date=November 2006|title=The Ruins of Barjac: Politics, alchemy, and learning to dance in Anselm Kiefer's world|url=|journal=Modern Painters|volume=|pages=68\u201375|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[Image:Anselm Kieffer - 'Glaube , Hoffnung, Liebe'.JPG|thumb|right|''Faith, Hope, love'' by Anselm Kiefer]]\n===Photography===\nKiefer began his career creating performances and documenting them in photographs titled ''Occupations and Heroische Sinnbilder (Heroic Symbols)''.  Dressed in his father's [[Wehrmacht]] uniform, Kiefer mimicked the [[Nazi salute]] in various locations in France, Switzerland and Italy. He asked Germans to remember and to acknowledge the loss to their culture through the mad [[xenophobia]] of the [[Third Reich]].

He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The use of these materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials in such a way that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and carpet felt in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nKiefer returned to the area of his birthplace in 1971. In the years that followed, he incorporated German mythology in particular in his work, and in the next decade he studied the [[Kabbalah]], as well as [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalists]] like Robert Fludd.<ref name=\"Rumelin\"/> He went on extended journeys throughout Europe, the USA and the Middle East; the latter two journeys further influenced his work. Besides paintings, Kiefer created sculptures, watercolors, photographs, and woodcuts, using woodcuts in particular to create a repertoire of figures he could reuse repeatedly in all media over the next decades, lending his work its knotty thematic coherence.<ref name=Rumelin>R\u00fcmelin, Christian. \"Anselm Kiefer: Rolling on the River Rhine,\" ''Art in Print'' Vol. 8 No. 1 (May\u2013June 2018).</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Kiefer made numerous paintings, watercolors, woodcuts, and books on themes interpreted by [[Richard Wagner]] in his four-opera cycle [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] (The Ring of the Nibelung).<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1995.14.14] Anselm Kiefer, ''My Father Pledged Me a Sword'' (1974\u201375), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York</ref> \n\nIn the early 1980s, he created more than thirty paintings, painted photographs, and watercolors that refer in their titles and inscriptions to the Romanian Jewish writer [[Paul Celan]]'s poem \"Todesfuge\" (\"Death Fugue\").<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.96.7] Anselm Kiefer, ''Your Golden Hair, Margarete'' (1980) Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</ref>\n\nA series of paintings which Kiefer executed between 1980 and 1983 depict looming stone edifices, referring to famous examples of National Socialist architecture, particularly buildings designed by [[Albert Speer]] and [[Wilhelm Kreis]].

Such works, like ''Heavy Cloud'' (1985), were an indirect response to the controversy in West Germany in the early 1980s about NATO's stationing of tactical nuclear missiles on German soil and the placement of nuclear fuel processing facilities.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1995.14.41] Anselm Kiefer, ''Heavy Cloud'' (1985), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on [[Germany]]'s role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involved not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. During the 1980s his paintings became more physical, and featured unusual textures and materials.<ref>[[Sue Hubbard]] (24 October 2008), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/margarete-1981-by-anselm-kiefer-saatchi-collection-970630.html] Margarete (1981) by Anselm Kiefer (Saatchi collection). ''The Independent''</ref> The range of his themes broadened to include references to ancient Hebrew and Egyptian history, as in the large painting ''Osiris and Isis'' (1985\u201387).

Taking over 20 years to create (1971-1991), 20 Years of Solitude is a ceiling-high stack of hundreds of white-painted ledgers and handmade books, strewn with dirt and dried vegetation, whose pages are stained with the artist\u2019s semen. The word solitude in the title references the artists frequent masturbation onto paper during the 20 years it took to create. He asked American art critic Peter Schjeldahl to write a text for a catalog of the masturbation books. Schjeldahl attempted to oblige but ultimately failed in his endeavor. No other critic would take on the task, so the work has largely faded into obscurity.<ref name=Schjeldahl1998>{{cite web|last=Schjeldahl |first=Peter |title=lost in the terrain: anselm kiefer |date=12 February 1998 |url= http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/schjeldahl/schjeldahl2-12-98.asp |publisher=Artnet}}</ref>\n\nHe would shock the art world yet again at a dinner party in May of 1993. Kiefer and his second wife, Renate Graf, decorated a candlelit commercial loft in New York with white muslin, carpeted the floor with white sand, and staffed it with waiters dressed as mimes with white-face. A handful of art world elite, such as the likes of Sherrie Levine, were served several courses of arcane organ meats, such as pancreas, that were mostly white in color. Not surprisingly, the guests did not find the meal to be particularly appetizing. <ref name=Schjeldahl1998 />\n\nSince 2002, Kiefer has worked with concrete, creating the towers destined for the Pirelli warehouses in Milan, the series of tributes to [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] (paintings of the sea, with boats and an array of leaden objects, 2004-5), a return to the work of [[Paul Celan]]<ref>[http://ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan-1] Anselm Kiefer, Thaddaeus Ropac</ref> with a series of paintings featuring rune motifs (2004\u20136), and other sculptures.<ref>[http://archive.monumenta.com/2007/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=9&lang=en]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Anselm Kiefer Biographie, Monumenta 2007, Paris</ref> In 2003, he held his first solo show at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg Villa Katz, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/am-anfang Anselm Kiefer: Am Anfang],'' dedicated to a series of new works, centered on the recurring themes of history and myths. In 2005, he held his second exhibition in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's Salzburg location, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan F\u00fcr Paul Celan],'' which focused on Kiefer's preoccupation with the book, linking references to Germanic mythology with the poetry of Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jew from Czernowitz. The exhibition featured eleven works on canvas, a series of bound books shown in display cases, and five sculptures, including one powerful, monumental outdoor sculpture of reinforced concrete and lead elements, two leaden piles of books combined with bronze sunflowers, lead ships and wedges, and two monumental leaden books from the series The Secret Life of Plants. The exhibition toured to Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris and Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, the following year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2006, Kiefer's exhibition, ''Velimir Chlebnikov'', was first shown in a small studio near Barjac, then moved to [[White Cube]] in London, then finishing in the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]] in Connecticut. The work consists of 30 large (2 x 3 meters) paintings, hanging in two banks of 15 on facing walls of an expressly constructed corrugated steel building that mimics the studio in which they were created. The work refers to the eccentric theories of the [[Russian Futurism|Russian futurist]] philosopher/poet [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velimir Chlebnikov]], who invented a \"language of the future\" called \"Zaum\", and who postulated that cataclysmic sea battles shift the course of history once every 317 years. In his paintings, Kiefer's toy-like battleships\u2014misshapen, battered, rusted and hanging by twisted wires\u2014are cast about by paint and plaster waves.

The same year, he inaugurated the Monumenta exhibitions series at the Grand Palais<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandpalais.fr/en/article/monumenta|title=Monumenta|website=www.grandpalais.fr|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> in Paris, with works paying special tribute to the poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann.\n\nIn 2009 Kiefer mounted two exhibitions at the White Cube gallery in London. A series of forest diptychs and triptychs enclosed in glass vitrines, many filled with dense Moroccan thorns, was titled ''Karfunkelfee'', a term from [[German Romanticism]] stemming from a poem by the post-war Austrian writer [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. In ''The Fertile Crescent'', Kiefer presented a group of epic paintings inspired by a trip to India fifteen years earlier where he first encountered rural brick factories. Over the past decade, the photographs that Kiefer took in India \"reverberated\" in his mind to suggest a vast array of cultural and historical references, reaching from the first human civilization of [[Mesopotamia]] to the ruins of Germany in the aftermath of [[World War II|the Second World War]], where he played as a boy. \"Anyone in search of a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur\", wrote the historian [[Simon Schama]] in his catalogue essay, \"would do well to look hard at Kiefer\u2019s ''The Fertile Crescent''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/anselm_kiefer_masons_yard_hoxton_square_2009|title=Anselm Kiefer: Karfunkelfee and The Fertile Crescent|date=16 October 2009|publisher=White Cube}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Morgenthau Plan'' (2012), the gallery is filled with a sculpture of a golden wheat field, enclosed in a five-meter-high steel cage.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/anselm-kiefer--october-19-2012] Anselm Kiefer: Morgenthau Plan, 19 October 2012 \u2013 26 January 2013, Gagosian Gallery, Paris</ref> That same year, Kiefer inaugurated Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's gallery space in Pantin, with an exhibition of monumental new works, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/die-ungeborenen Die Ungeborenen].''

Early examples are typically worked-over photographs; his more recent books consist of sheets of lead layered with paint, minerals, or dried plant matter.

In 1999 the Japan Art Association awarded him the [[Praemium Imperiale]] for his lifetime achievements. In the explanatory statement it reads:\n\n\"A complex critical engagement with history runs through Anselm Kiefer's work. His paintings as well as the sculptures of [[Georg Baselitz]] created an uproar at the 1980 Venice Biennale: the viewers had to decide whether the apparent Nazi motifs were meant ironically or whether the works were meant to convey actual fascist ideas. Kiefer worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatized nation and a vexed, divided world. He created epic paintings on giant canvases that called up the history of German culture with the help of depictions of figures such as [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Goethe]], thus continuing the historical tradition of painting as a medium of addressing the world. Only a few contemporary artists have such a pronounced sense of art's duty to engage the past and the ethical questions of the present, and are in the position to express the possibility of the absolution of guilt through human effort.\"\n\nIn 2008, Kiefer was awarded the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]], given for the first time to a visual artist.

He acknowledges the issue, but says change is part of the process and that their essence will ultimately stay the same. This idea of transformation has a kind of appeal for Kiefer and thus is featured in many of his works. This fascination for the process may have stemmed from the artist\u2019s keen interest in alchemy. He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014lead in particular being chief among them. In the case of lead, he specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he would see many colors\u2014especially that of gold\u2014which he thought of in a symbolic sense as the gold sought by alchemists. He is also particularly fond of the oxidation of white on lead. He would often try to induce oxidation artificially with the use of acid to speed up the process. Lead was also associated with the alchemical concepts of magic numbers and represented the planet Saturn.\n\nShellac, another material popular in his work, corresponded to lead in terms of how he felt about its color and energy possibilities. He also liked that while being polished it takes on energy and becomes warm to the touch.\n\nThe use of straw in his work is also in part the result of this common theme of energy. Straw again features the color gold and gives off energy, heat, and warmth when burned. This would make way for new creation thus continuing the cycle of life through the transformation process.<ref>14</ref>\nIn 2011, [[Christie's]] set a new worldwide record of $3.6&nbsp;million for the artist, when it sold ''To the Unknown Painter'' (1983) to an American private collector.<ref name=\"fever\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holocaust memorial landscapes in Germany]]\n\n==Biography, criticism, catalogues, monographs, documentaries==\n* Alteveer, Ian.
