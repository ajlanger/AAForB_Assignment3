Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialisation of conventional units.\n\n==History==\n\nThe name \u201cJagdkommando\u201d has its origins in the time of [[World War I]], when small assault squads of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian K.u.K. Army]] were called what translates to \u201cmanhunt command.\u201d\n\nThe history of the Austrian Special Operations Forces began in 1961, when a group of Austrian officers participated in the [[US Army]]'s [[Ranger School]] as part of their training in order to set up a similar course for the eventual establishment of Jagdkommando. Since then, the officers and soldiers of Jagdkommando have continued to evolve by taking part in similar courses in the [[United States]] and all over [[Europe]] and by combining the lessons learned with \"homegrown\" tactics and knowledge. The unit has earned the respect of other nations' special forces very quickly. The headquarters of the Jagdkommando is located in [[Wiener Neustadt]].\n\nMost of the missions are classified, but the Jagdkommando usually operates in places where regular Austrian troops are also located - such as the [[Balkans]] ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], etc.), [[Afghanistan]] ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], until 2005) and [[Chad]] ([[EUFOR Tchad/RCA]], since 2008). In the east of Chad about 50 Jagdkommando soldiers are deployed to protect refugee camps near the border to [[Darfur]] from early 2008 on.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/tschad.htm 2007 - Jagdkommando prepares for Tchad Mission]</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Jagdkommando are equipped with the VT Hunter OTV as part of preparations to intervene in Mali.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160617142346/http://www.janes.com/article/61468/jagdkommando-readies-vt-hunter-otv-for-possible-west-african-operations</ref> They would be deployed with [[French Armed Forces|French troops]] under [[Operation Barkhane]].<ref>https://www.sofx.com/2016/06/25/austrian-special-forces-prepare-deployment-mali-defenceweb/</ref>\n\n===Current structure===\n*Headquarters\n**1st Special Operations Task Group\n**2nd Special Operations Task Group\n**3rd Special Operations Task Group (''Reserve'')\n\n==Selection and training==\n[[File:Jagdkommando Fallschirmspringer.jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando airborne operations]]\n\nSelection is usually held once a year and has a duration of 6 months. The program normally begins in January with 3 weeks of pre-selection. During this time the candidate will take the physical tests required, receive additional training and undergo a 72-hour Field Exercise, which is the core event of the selection process.\n\nMost candidates will fail during the 72-hour exercise which includes long road marches in squad size elements, psychological test batteries, and total sleep deprivation. The pre-selection course is conducted by active operators as well as by enablers of the unit.\n[[File:Jagdkommando trainiert (29638388276).jpg|thumb|Two soldiers of the Jagdkommando]]\nNormally 20-25% of all candidates will pass the pre selection course and continue with the so-called Jagdkommandogrundkurs, the basic course of selection. The first few weeks are held in the remote area of [[Allentsteig]], a giant military training area in close proximity to the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border. The first seven weeks of small unit tactics are overshadowed with plenty of snow, freezing weather, very small amounts of sleep and permanent physical performance. Candidates will get used to the heavy Lowe Rucksack and spend most of their day with it on their backs while conducting patrols, ambushes, and raids in the forests around Allentsteig.\n\nAfter the small unit tactics phase, which will eliminate the last few unfitting candidates, the basic course will continue with block course of two or three weeks each:\n*Basic Demolition Course\n*Airborne Course\n*Amphibious Insertion/Extraction Course\n*Field Survival Course\n*Basic CQB Course\n*Combat diver Course\n*Field training exercises[[File:Jagdkommando Kampfschwimmer.jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando frogmen]][[File:Luftlandung (19889238211).jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Jagdkommando rope down a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]]]]\n*SERE\n\n===SERE===\nThe final and most infamous course is the SERE training. Over the last few years the SERE training took part in the [[Alps]] of [[Salzburg]]. The \u201crun phase\u201d will last up to ten days, while the candidate must check in at a given checkpoints every 24 hours. The checkpoints are set 20\u201330&nbsp;km apart, considering the mountains in between the points and the tactical need to stay off roads and trails, the candidates will be very busy meeting their time limits and rarely find sleep. Finally after days on the run and being hunted down by infantry units, helicopters and [[Police dog|K9]] units, the candidates will be ambushed and captured at one of their checkpoints. This marks the beginning of the \u201ccaptivity phase\u201d. Being the last phase of the selection course this phase will last 72 hours.\n\nAfter completing the SERE course the remaining soldiers (normally 10-15% of all applicants who started the pre selection course) are accepted into the Jagdkomamndo brotherhood and awarded the \u201cmudd-green\u201d beret with the Unit Crest on it. Most of the graduates will be given a slot as active operators in one of the two Task Groups of the unit, while some go back to their regular Army unit.\n\nJagdkommando soldiers take extreme pride in their long and unique selection course and the prestige that comes along with earning the olive beret inside the armed forces.\n[[File:Austria (\u00d6sterreich), Zeltweg (Flughafen Hinterstoisser), AirPower 2013, OH-58 Kiowa, 0190.JPG|thumb|A soldier of the Jagdkommando on a [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa]]]]\nIf a soldier is chosen to become an operator after selection he will attend the Einsatzausbildung 1, a course where he will refine his operator skills. The training will last up to one year.\n\nNormally it starts off with a five-week drivers course, followed by shooting classes. This will be the first time for operators to use the advanced weapon systems Steyr AUG A2 Kdo and the FN P90. After weeks at the shooting range the next courses will be very mountain orientated, like the mountain airborne course, winter warfare and mountaineering courses as well as ski training.\n\nAfter the mountain courses the individual job training will begin. Depending on the assignment the operator will attend the Weapon Sergeant Course, Medic Course, Communications Sergeant Course or Engineer Course.\n\nThe SOF [[Close combat|CQB]] course that follows teaches the latest techniques in HRO, CC, and DDO. Jagdkommando operators train together with several NATO SOF units worldwide and so the used SOPs and tactics are very similar to other SOF units.\n[[File:Jagdkommando-Soldaten springen aus einer \"Hercules\" (18629580342).jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando soldiers jump out of a C-130 Hercules]]\n[[File:Zugriff (21734716363).jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Jagdkommando capture a ship on the Danube]]\nDifferent other courses will complete the Einsatzausbildung 1, such as the Urban SR course, advanced combatives training and Air Assault techniques.\n\nAfter more than 18 months of training the operator will be assigned a team in the 1st SOTG (Special Operations Task Group) or the 2nd SOTG. The 3rd SOTG belongs to the Army Reserve Component. A typical Jagdkommando team consists of six operators: the Team Leader, Team Sergeant, a Weapons Sergeant/Sniper, Engineer Sergeant, Medic Sergeant and Communication Sergeant. Each team is assigned to one insertion speciality, such as freefall, amphibious, mountain and mobility.\n\n==Equipment==\n\n* [[Barrett M95]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/jakdo.htm |title=Das Jagdkommando (Jakdo) |language=German |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>\n* [[Barrett M82]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\"/>\n* [[FN Herstal]] [[FN P90|P90]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\"/><ref>S\u00fcnkler, S\u00f6ren. \"Elite und Spezialeinheiten Europas\" (in German).
