The haplogroup then seemingly further spread with the Neolithic [[Cardial Ware]] expansion, which established agriculture in the Western Mediterranean around 7500 BP: R1b-V88 haplogroups were identified in ancient Neolithic individuals in central Italy, Iberia and, at a particularly high frequency, in Sardinia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14523-6?|title=Genetic history from the Middle Neolithic to present on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia|journal=Nature|year=2020}}</ref> A part of the branch leading to present-day African haplogroups (V2197) is already derived in some of these ancient Neolithic European individuals, providing further support for a North to South trans-saharan movement.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n===External phylogeny of R1b===\n{{main|Haplogroup P-P295|Structure of Y-DNA Haplogroup K}}\n\nThe broader haplogroup [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R]] (M207) is a primary subclade of haplogroup [[Haplogroup P-M45|P1]] (M45) itself a primary branch of [[Haplogroup P (Y-DNA)|P]] (P295), which is also known as haplogroup K2b2. R-M207 is therefore a secondary branch of  [[Haplogroup K2b (Y-DNA)|K2b]] (P331), and a direct descendant of [[Haplogroup K2|K2]] (M526).\n\nThere was \"an initial rapid diversification\" of [[Haplogroup K2|K-M526]], according to Karafet et al. (2014), which \"likely occurred in [[Southeast Asia]], with subsequent westward expansions of the ancestors of haplogroups R and [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q]]\".\n;Phylogeny within ''[[Haplogroup K2b (Y-DNA)|K2b]]''\n* [[Haplogroup P (Y-DNA)|P]] P295/PF5866/S8 (also known as ''K2b2'').\n** [[Haplogroup P1 (Y-DNA)|P1]] M45 (a.k.a.''K2b2a'')\n*** [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q]] M242 (''K2b2a1'')\n*** [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R]] M207 (''K2b2a2'')\n**** [[Haplogroup R1|R1]] (M173)\n***** [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] (M420)\n***** '''R1b''' (M343)\n\n=== Internal structure of R1b ===\nNames such as R1b, R1b1 and so on are [[phylogenetic]] (i.e. \"family tree\") names which make clear their place within the branching of haplogroups, or the phylogenetic tree. An alternative way of naming the same haplogroups and subclades refers to their defining [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] mutations: for example, R-M343 is equivalent to R1b.<ref name=Cinnio04/> Phylogenetic [[Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups|names change with new discoveries]] and SNP-based names are consequently reclassified within the phylogenetic tree. In some cases, an SNP is found to be unreliable as a defining mutation and an SNP-based name is removed completely. For example, before 2005, R1b was synonymous with R-P25, which was later reclassified as R1b1; in 2016, R-P25 was removed completely as a defining SNP, due to a significant rate of back-mutation.<ref name=\"isogg2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://isogg.org/tree/2016/ISOGG_HapgrpR16.html|title=ISOGG 2016 Y-DNA Haplogroup R|website=isogg.org}}</ref> (Below is the basic outline of R1b according to the ISOGG Tree as it stood on January 30, 2017.<ref name=isogg/>)\n\n{|| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgray;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:left\";| '''Basic phylogenetic tree for R1b'''\n|- style=\"text-align:left\"\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:120%;\"\n|{{Clade\n| label1=<small> M343/PF6242 </small>\n| 1={{Clade\n  | label1=\n  | 1=   <small>R-M343* (R1b*).
