To reach the Core, at least one line of defensive structures, known as \"forts\" and \"keeps\", needs to be destroyed. Players can use the assistance of mercenary camps'','' battleground [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]], and a small group of computer-controlled units, called \"minions\"'','' to assault enemy more efficiently. Minions periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] throughout the game in groups, marching along the lanes toward the enemy base. There are currently 15 battlegrounds available to play, each of which has different [[Metagaming|meta]] and secondary objectives to secure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Completing these secondary objectives can give your team massive advantages, typically through pushing power.\n\nIn all game modes, each player controls one of the 88 [[Player character|playable characters]] (as of December 2019),<ref name=\":2\" /> called \"heroes\", with each having a unique design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into six separate roles: tank, bruiser, ranged assassin, melee assassin, healer, and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/|title=Hero role expansion|last=|first=|date=|website=Heroes of the Storm|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> Initially, no heroes are permanently available for use; however, players may choose from a list of heroes that are free to use from a weekly rotation. By using the [[Virtual economy|in-game currency]], called \"Gold\", or through microtransactions, they can gain permanent access to a hero.\n\nEach individual hero comes with its own gameplay kit with unique abilities. Ability kit is generally composed of three basic abilities usable right from level 1, a passive or active trait, and a powerful \"heroic ability\". Upon reaching level 10, players can choose between two \"heroics\"<ref name=\":3\" /> which often have a devastating effect and a long [[cooldown]]. Heroics are usually the strongest tools in an arsenal that define a hero's strengths and playstyle. A hero can only gain one type of heroic per match. If a hero [[Life (gaming)|runs out of health points]] and dies, he is removed from active play until a respawn timer counts down to zero, where he is then respawned in his base.\n\n[[Experience point]]s, which can be gained by being nearby enemy heroes and minions when they're killed, are shared across the entire team. In addition, certain enemy structures, such as towers, forts and keeps, will provide experience to the team who destroys them, as well as captured mercenary camps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes-of-the-storm/22556628/heroes-of-the-storm-2019-gameplay-updates|title=Heroes of the Storm: 2019 Gameplay Updates|website=news.blizzard.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> When a team during the course of the match reaches a certain experience point threshold, every hero on that team levels up, acquiring slightly amplified powers, up to a maximum level of 30. Every few levels, players may select a \"talent\" which offers a new ability or augments an existing one. Two significant power spikes are at level 10 and level 20, where heroes gain access to an especially powerful set of abilities and talents, called \"heroic\" and \"storm talents\", respectively. This leveling system emphasizes the importance of teamwork and planning since a player's action can affect the whole team.\n\nPlayers can also utilize various mounts, such as animals, bikes, and clouds, to increase their movement speed, automatically dismounting when attacking, receiving damage or using any ability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wowhead.com/news=223449/heroes-of-the-storm-what-we-know|title=Heroes of the Storm: What We Know|last=Ashelia|website=Wowhead|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\n''Heroes of the Storm'' includes several game modes players can select, which include playing against computer-controlled heroes or other players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heroesofthestorm.com/en/game/|title=Game Modes - Heroes of the Storm|last=|first=|date=|website=heroesofthestorm.com|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n\n*'''Tutorials''' - The tutorials are composed of three scripted 'levels' that are aimed at new players with the intent of teaching movement, use of abilities and other basic controls. The player controls [[Jim Raynor]], who is teleported from the ''StarCraft'' universe into the Nexus, receiving instructions from Uther Lightbringer from the ''Warcraft'' series.\n*'''Training''' - A reduced experience mode where a player teams up with four AI teammates against five AI opponents set at the Beginner difficulty.\n*'''Versus A.I.''' - Players face off against five AI opponents. Before starting the match, the player can choose to have human-controlled or AI allies. The AI difficulty can be chosen prior to initiating a match.\n*'''Quick Match''' - Players choose their heroes before entering the match without knowing what map they are playing, or what heroes they will be matched with and against. This mode sets two teams of five human-controlled heroes against each other on a random map in [[Player versus player|Player-Versus-Player]] style combat. These teams are selected based on the player's past performance to create an even playing field, as well as the roles of heroes chosen. For example, if a player queues without other party members as a Support, they are extremely unlikely to be matched with four other Support teammates.\n*'''Unranked''' - This is a draft mode where each team takes a turn choosing heroes, generally based on each hero's strength on that particular map and how well the hero works with the team composition. Each team can also ban three heroes so neither team can draft them for that match. Players will get the same practice of drafting as in Ranked Play, but without the additional stress that may come with Ranked Play.\n*'''Ranked''' - Storm League is a draft mode similar to Unranked Draft; however, players are placed in divisions from Bronze to Grand Master based on their in-game performance. Players who choose to play competitively as an individual or as a team of up to 5 players can play in a Storm League match to be matched with other players in their region. In order to play in Storm League, players must have access to 16 heroes at level 5 or higher (excluding Cho'gall) and have an account level of 50 or higher. As players compete in these matches, they will be awarded ranking points which will progress their League Rank and begin to place them in more challenging match-ups. Player rank is expressed in the form of League Tiers and Divisions, and this rank is assigned separately for each individual player. Rank is determined by the player's MMR directly and adjusted by penalties, such as Leaver Penalty. The first official Ranked Play season began on June 14, 2016, and ended on September 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20142851/ranked-season-1-roll-and-rewards-6-13-2016|title=Ranked Season 1 Roll and Rewards|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}</ref> Each Ranked Play season is set to last for approximately 3\u20134 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/heroes-of-the-storm/22821339/2019-ranked-season-1-dates-and-rewards|title=2019 Ranked Season 1 Dates and Rewards|website=news.blizzard.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes-of-the-storm/23013883/2019-season-3-changes-and-updates|title=2019 Season 3 \u2013 Changes and Updates|website=news.blizzard.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n*'''Heroes Brawl''' - Added on October 18, 2016, this game mode has three different subcategories with varying rules.

The first team to complete the objective will claim victory. The first to win two rounds wins the match. There are multiple arena maps exclusively designed for this mode.\n**'''Mutators''' - Unique mechanics change the way you play on the already familiar Battlegrounds.\n**'''Single-Lanes''' - One-lane Battlegrounds with no objectives, or \"hearthstone\".\n* '''Custom Games''' - Often used for tournament play, players can create a lobby and make a predetermined match-up of up to five players versus five players, with the ability to choose the map, whether to enable draft mode, and whether to add AI-controlled heroes and/or allow up to six observers.\n\n===Matchmaking===\nMatchmaking is based on the [[Elo rating system]] with proprietary adjustments.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/29/8934592/heroes-of-the-storm-update-qhira-storm-league-ranked|title=Heroes of the Storm is getting a new hero and ranked queue system|last=Marshall|first=Cass|date=2019-07-29|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> MMR (matchmaking rating) is calculated individually for each player, and it is tracked separately for every game mode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/heroes-storm-team-talks-blizzcon-new-hero-qhira-and-future|title=Adam Jackson, Live Designer: Each game mode has a separate MMR for each player.|last=|first=|date=2019-07-30|website=Windows Central|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> In ranked mode matchmaker tries to place players with similar ratings together,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dignitas.gg/articles/blogs/Heroes-Of-The-Storm/13600/on-storm-league-and-the-evolution-of-ranked-play-in-hots|title=You can no longer queue together with players that are more than two Leagues apart from your own rank.|last=|first=|date=|website=dignitas.gg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> while generally attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR to find and create even games.\n\n==Business model==\n''Heroes of the Storm'' is [[free-to-play]], based on [[freemium]] business model, and is supported by [[micropayments]] using three in-game currencies: \"Gems\", \"Gold\", and \"Shards\".

To reach the Core, at least one line of defensive structures, known as \"forts\" and \"keeps\", needs to be destroyed. Players can use the assistance of mercenary camps'','' battleground [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]], and a small group of computer-controlled units, called \"minions\"'','' to assault enemy more efficiently. Minions periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] throughout the game in groups, marching along the lanes toward the enemy base. There are currently 15 battlegrounds available to play, each of which has different [[Metagaming|meta]] and secondary objectives to secure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Completing these secondary objectives can give your team massive advantages, typically through pushing power.\n\nIn all game modes, each player controls one of the 88 [[Player character|playable characters]] (as of December 2019),<ref name=\":2\" /> called \"heroes\", with each having a unique design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into six separate roles: tank, bruiser, ranged assassin, melee assassin, healer, and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/|title=Hero role expansion|last=|first=|date=|website=Heroes of the Storm|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> Initially, no heroes are permanently available for use; however, players may choose from a list of heroes that are free to use from a weekly rotation. By using the [[Virtual economy|in-game currency]], called \"Gold\", or through microtransactions, they can gain permanent access to a hero.\n\nEach individual hero comes with its own gameplay kit with unique abilities. Ability kit is generally composed of three basic abilities usable right from level 1, a passive or active trait, and a powerful \"heroic ability\". Upon reaching level 10, players can choose between two \"heroics\"<ref name=\":3\" /> which often have a devastating effect and a long [[cooldown]]. Heroics are usually the strongest tools in an arsenal that define a hero's strengths and playstyle. A hero can only gain one type of heroic per match. If a hero [[Life (gaming)|runs out of health points]] and dies, he is removed from active play until a respawn timer counts down to zero, where he is then respawned in his base.\n\n[[Experience point]]s, which can be gained by being nearby enemy heroes and minions when they're killed, are shared across the entire team. In addition, certain enemy structures, such as towers, forts and keeps, will provide experience to the team who destroys them, as well as captured mercenary camps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes-of-the-storm/22556628/heroes-of-the-storm-2019-gameplay-updates|title=Heroes of the Storm: 2019 Gameplay Updates|website=news.blizzard.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> When a team during the course of the match reaches a certain experience point threshold, every hero on that team levels up, acquiring slightly amplified powers, up to a maximum level of 30. Every few levels, players may select a \"talent\" which offers a new ability or augments an existing one. Two significant power spikes are at level 10 and level 20, where heroes gain access to an especially powerful set of abilities and talents, called \"heroic\" and \"storm talents\", respectively. This leveling system emphasizes the importance of teamwork and planning since a player's action can affect the whole team.\n\nPlayers can also utilize various mounts, such as animals, bikes, and clouds, to increase their movement speed, automatically dismounting when attacking, receiving damage or using any ability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wowhead.com/news=223449/heroes-of-the-storm-what-we-know|title=Heroes of the Storm: What We Know|last=Ashelia|website=Wowhead|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\n''Heroes of the Storm'' includes several game modes players can select, which include playing against computer-controlled heroes or other players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heroesofthestorm.com/en/game/|title=Game Modes - Heroes of the Storm|last=|first=|date=|website=heroesofthestorm.com|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n\n*'''Tutorials''' - The tutorials are composed of three scripted 'levels' that are aimed at new players with the intent of teaching movement, use of abilities and other basic controls. The player controls [[Jim Raynor]], who is teleported from the ''StarCraft'' universe into the Nexus, receiving instructions from Uther Lightbringer from the ''Warcraft'' series.\n*'''Training''' - A reduced experience mode where a player teams up with four AI teammates against five AI opponents set at the Beginner difficulty.\n*'''Versus A.I.''' - Players face off against five AI opponents. Before starting the match, the player can choose to have human-controlled or AI allies. The AI difficulty can be chosen prior to initiating a match.\n*'''Quick Match''' - Players choose their heroes before entering the match without knowing what map they are playing, or what heroes they will be matched with and against. This mode sets two teams of five human-controlled heroes against each other on a random map in [[Player versus player|Player-Versus-Player]] style combat. These teams are selected based on the player's past performance to create an even playing field, as well as the roles of heroes chosen. For example, if a player queues without other party members as a Support, they are extremely unlikely to be matched with four other Support teammates.\n*'''Unranked''' - This is a draft mode where each team takes a turn choosing heroes, generally based on each hero's strength on that particular map and how well the hero works with the team composition. Each team can also ban three heroes so neither team can draft them for that match. Players will get the same practice of drafting as in Ranked Play, but without the additional stress that may come with Ranked Play.\n*'''Ranked''' - Storm League is a draft mode similar to Unranked Draft; however, players are placed in divisions from Bronze to Grand Master based on their in-game performance. Players who choose to play competitively as an individual or as a team of up to 5 players can play in a Storm League match to be matched with other players in their region. In order to play in Storm League, players must have access to 16 heroes at level 5 or higher (excluding Cho'gall) and have an account level of 50 or higher. As players compete in these matches, they will be awarded ranking points which will progress their League Rank and begin to place them in more challenging match-ups. Player rank is expressed in the form of League Tiers and Divisions, and this rank is assigned separately for each individual player. Rank is determined by the player's MMR directly and adjusted by penalties, such as Leaver Penalty. The first official Ranked Play season began on June 14, 2016, and ended on September 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20142851/ranked-season-1-roll-and-rewards-6-13-2016|title=Ranked Season 1 Roll and Rewards|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}</ref> Each Ranked Play season is set to last for approximately 3\u20134 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/heroes-of-the-storm/22821339/2019-ranked-season-1-dates-and-rewards|title=2019 Ranked Season 1 Dates and Rewards|website=news.blizzard.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes-of-the-storm/23013883/2019-season-3-changes-and-updates|title=2019 Season 3 \u2013 Changes and Updates|website=news.blizzard.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n*'''Heroes Brawl''' - Added on October 18, 2016, this game mode has three different subcategories with varying rules.
