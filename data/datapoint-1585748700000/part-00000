However, the subfamily of [[Phlebotominae]] does feed on blood with the ability to transmit (tropical) diseases, and ''[[Sycorax silacea]]'' can transmit [[microfilaria]].<ref>Schulz-St\u00fcbner, Sebastian, et al. \"Psychodidae (Drain Fly) Infestation in an Operating Room.\" Infection control and hospital epidemiology 36.3 (2015): 366-367.</ref> Inhalation of insect fragments may cause respiratory [[asthma]].\n\n==Pest control==\nProtected by the extremely fine water-repellent hairs covering their bodies, adults and larvae are difficult to drown,<ref name=\"Townsend\" /> and are not affected by contact with most water-borne toxins such as bleach.  Boiling water has little or no effect on the adults for the same reason, and even the eggs are highly resistant to both chemical or thermal assault.  Eggs can also withstand periods of dehydration.  Extermination of this household pest depends on the maintenance of clean household drains for a period of at least three weeks.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nSuspect drains can be identified by placing a glass jar or taping a clear plastic bag over them, and periodically checking for adult flies.<ref name=\"PSU\" /> A clear plastic cup coated inside with vegetable oil or [[petroleum jelly]] can also be used.<ref name=\"Townsend\" /> Partially covering the drain opening with sticky adhesive tape is another method used to identify breeding sources.<ref name=\"DIYPC\" />\n\nThorough mechanical cleaning of drains will remove the larval food source, and is the most effective control measure.<ref name=\"Townsend\" /> High-pressure drain cleaning will not only eradicate the feeding source of the larvae, it also cleans the entire length of pipe reducing the likelihood of drain flies from returning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jabplumbingsolutions.com.au/blog/2018/12/5/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-for-good|title=How to Get Rid of Drain Flies For Good|last=Bonanno|first=Jason|date=|website=JAB Plumbing Solutions|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> Alternatively, injected foams containing bacteria or enzymes may be useful to break down gelatinous scum deposits.<ref name=\"PSU\" /> Besides sink drains, floor drains and shower drains are common sources, as well as leaky shower pans, but any location with moist decaying organic matter can be a breeding site.<ref name=\"DIYPC\" /> In commercial buildings, [[sump pump]] pits, sewers, and [[elevator]] pits may trap moisture where drain flies can breed.<ref name=\"DIYPC\">{{cite web|title=Get Rid Of Drain Flies {{!}} Drain Fly Control Treatment|url=https://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/drainflies.htm|website=Do It Yourself Pest Control|accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their attraction to light, drain flies may be monitored by using [[Fly-killing device#Fan-based trap|fan-based traps]] baited with visible or [[ultraviolet light]]. However, only killing adult flies is usually not effective; larval food sources must be removed to stop more flies from emerging.<ref name=\"DIYPC\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fungus gnat]]\n* [[Trichomyia lengleti]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Quate, L.W. 1955.
