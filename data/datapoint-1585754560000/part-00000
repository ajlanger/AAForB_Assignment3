While the festivals of July dealt with untamed nature (woods) and waters (superficial waters the Neptunalia and underground waters the Furrinalia) at a time of danger caused by their relative deficiency, those of August were devoted to the results of human endeavour on nature with the storing of harvested grain (Consualia) and their relationship to human society and regality (Opiconsivia) which at that time were at risk and required protection from the dangers of the  excessive strength of the two elements of fire (Vulcanalia) and wind (Vulturnalia) reinforced by dryness.<ref>In Dum\u00e9zil's interpretation the Vulturnalia were associated with the protection of riping grapes from a hot and dry southwestern wind named Vulturnus, not with the river Tiber, as Mommsen had supposed, or Vulturnus of Campania.</ref> \n \nIt is recorded that during the Vulcanalia people used to hang their clothes and fabrics under the sun.<ref>[[Paulinus of Nola]] ''Letters'' XXXII, 139.</ref> This habit might reflect a theological connection between Vulcan and the divinized Sun.<ref>G.

His cult is located outside the boundaries of the original city to avoid the risk of fires caused by the god in the city itself.<ref>Plutarch ''Questiones Romanae'' 47; Vitruvius ''De architectura'' I,7,1</ref>\n\nThis power is, however, considered useful if directed against enemies and such a choice for the location of the god's cult could be interpreted in this way too. The same idea underlies the dedication of the arms of the defeated enemies,<ref>Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 562.</ref> as well as those of the surviving general in a [[Loyalty|devotion]] ritual to the god.<ref>Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'' VIII 10.</ref>\n\nThrough comparative interpretation this aspect has been connected by Dum\u00e9zil to the third or defensive fire in the theory of the three Vedic sacrificial fires.<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 2, chap. 2; It. tr. Milan 1977 pp. 277\u2013280.</ref> In such theory three fires are necessary to the discharge of a religious ceremony: the hearth of the landlord, which has the function of establishing a referential on Earth in that precise location connecting it with Heaven; the sacrificial fire, which conveys the offer to Heaven; and the defensive fire, which is usually located on the southern boundary of the sacred space and has a protective function against evil influences. Since the territory of the city of Rome was seen as a magnified temple in itself, the three fires should be identified as the hearth of the landlord in the temple of Vesta (''aedes Vestae''); the sacrificial fires of each temple, shrine or altar; and the defensive fire in the temple of Vulcan.\n\nAnother meaning of Vulcan is related to male fertilizing power. In various Latin and Roman legends he is the father of famous characters, such as the founder of [[Praeneste]] [[Caeculus]],<ref>Cato Censor ''Origines'' fragment 65, cited in ''Scholia Veronensia ad Aeneidem'' VII 681 p. 438, 16 ff. Hagen.</ref> [[Cacus]],<ref>Vergil ''Aeneis'' VIII 198.</ref> a primordial being or king, later transformed into a monster that inhabited the site of the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] in Rome, and Roman king [[Servius Tullius]]. In a variant of the story of the birth of [[Romulus]] the details are identical even though Vulcan is not explicitly mentioned.<ref>Plutarch ''Romulus'' II 3\u20136</ref>\n\n[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Ixion.jpg|thumb|Punishment of [[Ixion]]: in the center is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the [[caduceus]] and on the right [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] sits on her throne.

In this case he would be the father of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].<ref>Jacqueline Champeaux ''Fortuna, I, Fortuna dans la religion romaine archaique'' Rome, 1982; A. Mastrocinque ''Romolo. La fondazione di Roma tra storia e leggenda'' Este, 1993.</ref> This view is though in conflict with that which links the goddess to Jupiter, as his daughter (''puer Jovis'') and his mother too, as ''primigenia'', meaning \"primordial\".\n\nIn all of the above-mentioned stories the god's fertilizing power is related to that of the fire of the house hearth.\n\nIn the case of Caeculus, his mother was impregnated by a spark that dropped on her womb from the hearth while she was sitting nearby.<ref>Vergil ''Aeneis'' VII 680.</ref> [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother [[Ocresia]] was impregnated by a male sex organ that miraculously appeared in the ashes of the sacrificial ara, at the order of [[Tanaquil]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]]'s wife.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 627.</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]] tells the same story, but states that the father was the [[Lares|Lar familiaris]].<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXVI 204.</ref> The divinity of the child was recognized when his head was surrounded by flames and he remained unharmed.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 625\u2013636.</ref>\n\nThrough the comparative analysis of these myths archaeologist [[Andrea Carandini]] opines that [[Cacus]] and [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] were the sons of Vulcan and of a local divine being or a virgin as in the case of Caeculus. Cacus and Caca would represent the metallurgic and the domestic fire, projections of Vulcan and of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].\n\nThese legends date back to the time of preurban [[Latium]]. Their meaning is quite clear: at the divine level Vulcan impregnates a virgin goddess and generates Jupiter, the king of the gods; at the human level he impregnates a local virgin (perhaps of royal descent) and generates a king.<ref>Andrea Carandini ''La nascita di Roma'' Turin, 1997, p. 52.</ref>\n\nThe first mention of a ritual connection between Vulcan and Vesta is the [[lectisternium]] of 217 BC. Other facts that seem to hint at this connection are the relative proximity of the two sanctuaries and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]'s testimony that both cults had been introduced to Rome by [[Titus Tatius]] to comply with a vow he had made in battle.<ref>Dionysius Halicarnasseus ''Antiquitates Romanae'' II 50, 3.</ref> [[Varro]] confirms the fact.<ref>Varro ''Lingua Latina '' V 73: see above.</ref>\n\nVulcan is related to two equally ancient female goddesses [[Stata Mater]],<ref>CIL VI, 00802, found in Rome.</ref> perhaps the goddess who stops fires and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]].<ref>Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XII 23, 2: \"Maiam Volcani\".</ref>\n\n[[Herbert Jennings Rose]] interprets Maia as a goddess related to growth by connecting her name with IE root *MAG.<ref>H. J. Rose ''A dictionary of classical antiquities'' It. transl., Turin, 1995.</ref> [[Macrobius]] relates Cincius's opinion that Vulcan's female companion is Maia. Cincius justifies his view on the grounds that the ''flamen Volcanalis'' sacrificed to her at the Kalendae of May. In Piso's view the companion of the god is [[Maia (mythology)|Maiestas]].<ref>Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 12, 18.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Gellius]] as well, Maia was associated with Vulcan; and he backs up his view by quoting the ritual prayers in use by Roman priests.<ref>A. Gell. ''Noct. Att.'' XIII, 23, 2</ref><ref>Maiestas and Maia, though, are possibly the same divine person: compare Ovid's explanations of the meaning of the name of the month May in his ''Fasti'': V 1\u201352 Maiestas; 81\u2013106 Maia both as possible eponyms of May.</ref>\n\nThe god is the patron of trades related to ovens (cooks, bakers, confectioners) as attested in the works of [[Plautus]],<ref>Plautus ''Aulularia'' 359.</ref> [[Apuleius]] (the god is the cook at the wedding of [[Amor and Psyche]])<ref>Apuleius ''Metamorphoses'' VI 24, 2.</ref> and in [[Vespa]]'s short poem in the [[Anthologia Latina]] about the litigation between a cook and a baker.<ref>''Iudicium coci et pistoris iudice Vulcano''.</ref>\n\n==Sons==\nAccording to [[Hyginus]]' Fabulae, the sons of Vulcan are Philammon, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]], Corynetes, Cercyon, Philottus, and Spinther.<ref>Hyginus Fabulae 158.</ref>\n\n==Hypothetical origin==\nThe origin of the Roman god of fire Vulcan has been traced back to the Cretan god [[Velchanos]] by G\u00e9rard Capdeville, primarily under the suggestion of the close similarity of their names.<ref>G. Capdeville ''Volcanus. Rech\u00e9rches comparatistes sur le cult de Vulcain'' Rome 1994. Reviewed by Bernard Sergent in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''216''' 1999 4 p. 475-481; Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge in ''Kernos'' 1996 '''9''' p. 434-436.</ref> Cretan Velchanos is a young god of Mediterranean or Near Eastern origin who has mastership of fire and is the companion of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]]. These traits are  preserved in Latium only in his sons [[Cacus]], [[Caeculus]], [[Romulus]] and [[Servius Tullius]]. At Praeneste the uncles of Caeculus are known as Digiti,<ref>Solinus II 9; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 41, 1; 43, 3.</ref> noun that connects them to the Cretan ''[[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyl]]i''.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=November 2017}}\n\nHis theology would be reflected in the Greek myths of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]] and in those concerning the childhood of [[Zeus]] on [[Mount Ida]]. The Mediterranean Pregreek conception is apparent in the depiction of Velchanos as a young man sitting upon a fork of a tree on coins from [[Phaistos]] dating from 322 to 300 BC, showing him as a god of vegetation and springtime: the tree is the symbol of the union of Heaven and Earth and their generative power, i. e. the site of the union of the god and the goddess. Otherwise Earth would be symbolised in the tree and Heaven in the double axe of the god. Later Velchanos was depicted as a bull as testified in the myths of [[Pasiphae]] and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. The Greeks misunderstood the meaning of the bull as for them the symbol of Zeus was a bird: the cock, the cuckoo or the eagle. Theseus brought to [[Delos]] the dance named ''g\u00e9ranos'' (literally the dance of the crane) which Capdeville connects with ''Garanos'', a variant of the ''[[Recaranus]]''  of  Italic myths. B. Sergent remarks that such an inquiry needs to include the ''Tarvos Trigaranos'' (the ''bull of the three horns'') of Gaul.\n\nIn Crete, Velchanos was the god of initiatory practices of youngsters.<ref>G. Capdeville \"Jeux athletiques et rituels de fondation\" Publications de L' \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise de Rome 1993 p. 141-187.</ref>\n\nAnother reflection of the tradition of the Cretan Velchanos-Zeus would be found in [[Argolid]] in the mysteries of [[Zeus Lykaios]], which contemplated anthropophagy and may have inspired the Italic [[Lupercalia]].\n\nThe theological profile of Velchanos looks identical to that of ''[[Jupiter Dolichenus]]'', a god of primarily [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] ascendence in his identification with the bull, who has Sumero-Accadic, Aramaic and Hittito-Hurrite features as a god of tempest, according for example to the researches conducted in Syria by French scholar Paul Merlat. His cult enjoyed a period of popularity in the Roman Empire during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and the god had a temple in Rome on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]].<ref>Paul Merlat ''Jupiter Dolichenus, Essai d'int\u00e9rpretation et de synth\u00e8se'' Paris PUF 1960 reviewed by [[Alfred Merlin]] \"Jupiter Dolichenus\" in ''Journal des savants'' 1960 '''4''' p. 160-166.</ref>\n\n==Foundation of Rome==\n\nVelchanos was the supreme god of early Cretan religion, where the festival of the \u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 (Velchania) as well as a month \u03dc\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3 (Welchanios) are attested: a gloss by Hesychius states that \"Velchanos is Zeus among the Cretan\".<ref>Hesychius \u0393 315 Latte.</ref> He was the first god of the cavern of [[Mount Ida]], where he had an oracle, and was honoured also in Cyprus.\n\nHis name is very similar to that of Latin god Volcanus, who himself was considered to be the father of [[Caeculus]] and [[Servius Tullius]], not to mention Romulus in the version transmitted by Promathion, which is very similar to the legend of Servius.\n\nThe founder of Rome has a close relationship with this god as he founded the ''Volcanal'' and there he dedicated a quadriga with his own statue  after his first victory. It is there too that a part of the tradition locates the place of his death: the site was marked by the [[Lapis Niger]]: Festus writes \"Niger lapis in Comitio  locum funestum significat, ut ali, Romuli morti destinatum...\". On the day of the [[Volcanalia]] (August 23) a sacrifice was offered to Hora Quirini, paredra of [[Quirinus]] with whom  the deified Romulus was identified. As the Consualia were mentioned first in connection with the founding of Rome in the episode of the abduction of the Sabine women, as the Volcanalia are celebrated two days later and two days before the ''Opiconsivia'', and as the name Volcanus resembles that of the ancient Cretan god honoured in the \u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7?\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 who presided over initiation rites, the Consualia must have a meaning of integration into the citizenship. This provides an explanation for the choice of the festival of the ''[[Parilia]] '' as the date of the foundation of Rome, since these are first of all the festival of the ''iuniores''. Festus writes: \"Parilibus  Romulus Vrbem condidit, quem diem festum praecipue habebant iuniores.\" The date of April 21 marked the starting point of the process of initiation of the future new citizens which concluded four months later on the ceremony of the Consualia, which involves athletic games and marriages.<ref>G. Capdeville \"Jeux athl\u00e9tiques et rituels de fondation\" ''Publications de l'\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise de Rome'' 1993 p. 182-186.</ref>\n\n==Greek myths of Hephaestus==\n\nThrough his identification with the [[Hephaestus]] of [[Greek mythology]], Vulcan came to be considered as the manufacturer of art, arms, [[iron]], jewelry, and armor for various gods and heroes, including the lightning bolts of Jupiter. He was the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and the husband of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] and [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite (Venus)]]. His [[Forge|smithy]] was believed to be situated underneath [[Mount Etna]] in [[Sicily]].\n[[File:\u041f\u0456\u0442\u044d\u0440 \u0422\u044b\u0437. \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u045e \u043a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0456 \u0412\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430. XVII \u0441\u0442..jpg|thumb|208px|left|''Venus in the Forge of Vulcan'' by [[Pieter Thijs]]]]\nAs the son of Jupiter, the king of the gods, and Juno, the queen of the gods, Vulcan should have been quite handsome, but baby Vulcan was small and ugly with a red, bawling face. Juno was so horrified that she hurled the tiny baby off the top of [[Mount Olympus]].\n\nVulcan fell down for a day and a night, landing in the sea. Unfortunately, one of his legs broke as he hit the water, and never developed properly. Vulcan sank to the depths of the ocean,  where the sea-nymph [[Thetis]] found him and took him to her underwater grotto, wanting to raise him as her own son.\n\nVulcan had a happy childhood with dolphins as his playmates and pearls as his toys. Late in his childhood, he found the remains of a fisherman's fire on the beach and became fascinated with an unextinguished coal, still red-hot and glowing.\n\nVulcan carefully shut this precious coal in a clamshell, took it back to his underwater grotto, and made a fire with it. On the first day after that, Vulcan stared at this fire for hours on end. On the second day, he discovered that when he made the fire hotter with bellows, certain stones sweated iron, silver or gold. On the third day he beat the cooled metal into shapes: bracelets, chains, swords and shields. Vulcan made pearl-handled knives and spoons for his foster mother, and for himself he made a silver chariot with bridles so that seahorses could transport him quickly. He even made slave-girls of gold to wait on him and do his bidding.\n\nLater, Thetis left her underwater grotto to attend a dinner party on Mount Olympus wearing a beautiful necklace of silver and sapphires that Vulcan had made for her. Juno admired the necklace and asked where she could get one. Thetis became flustered, causing Juno to become suspicious; and, at last, the queen god discovered the truth: the baby she had once rejected had grown into a talented [[blacksmith]].\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez - La Fragua de Vulcano (Museo del Prado, 1630).jpg|thumb|right|''The Forge of Vulcan'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], (1630).]]\n\nJuno was furious and demanded that Vulcan return home, a demand that he refused. However, he did send Juno a beautifully constructed chair made of silver and gold, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Juno was delighted with this gift but, as soon as she sat in it her weight triggered hidden springs and metal bands sprung forth to hold her fast. The more she shrieked and struggled the more firmly the mechanical throne gripped her; the chair was a cleverly designed trap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=37}}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=January 2020|reason=the story does not appear in the work cited, which in any case is an old popular work of dubious reliability}}\n\nFor three days Juno sat fuming, still trapped in Vulcan's chair; she could not sleep, she could not stretch, she could not eat. It was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] who finally saved the day: he promised that if Vulcan released Juno he would give him a wife, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] the goddess of love and beauty. Vulcan agreed and married Venus. He later built a smithy under [[Mount Etna]] on the island of [[Sicily]]. It was said that whenever Venus was unfaithful, Vulcan grew angry and beat the red-hot metal with such a force that sparks and smoke rose up from the top of the mountain, creating a volcanic eruption.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to [[Virgil]], Vulcan was the father of [[Caeculus]].<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Verg.+A.+7.678 7.678\u2013681]; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Serv.+A.+7.678&fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0053 7.678].</ref>\n\nTo punish mankind for stealing the secrets of fire, Jupiter ordered the other gods to make a poisoned gift for man. Vulcan's contribution to the beautiful and foolish [[Pandora]] was to mould her from clay and to give her form. He also made the thrones for the other gods on [[Mount Olympus]].\n\n==Sanctuaries==\nThe main and most ancient sanctuary of Vulcan in Rome was the ''Volcanal'', located in the ''area Volcani'', an open-air space at the foot of the [[Capitolium]], in the northwestern corner of the [[Roman Forum]], with an area dedicated to the god and a perennial fire. It was one of the most ancient Roman shrines.<ref>Cf. above note 10, 11 and 12.</ref>\nAccording to Roman tradititon the sanctuary had been dedicated by [[Romulus]]. He had placed on the site a bronze [[quadriga]] dedicated to the god, a war trophy from the [[Fidenates]]. According to Plutarch, though, the war in question was that against [[Cameria]], that occurred sixteen years after the foundation of Rome.<ref name=\"Plutarch Romulus 24\">Plutarch ''Romulus'' 24.</ref> There Romulus would have also dedicated to Vulcan a statue of himself and an inscription in Greek characters listing  his successes.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antitquitites'' II 54, 2.</ref> Plutarch states that Romulus was represented crowned by [[Victory]].<ref name=\"Plutarch Romulus 24\"/> Moreover, he would have planted a sacred lotus tree<ref>The Italic lotus, ''diospyrus lotus'', or ''melilotus'', [[Columella]]  ''De Re Rustica'' VII 9; [[Galen]].</ref> in the sanctuary that was still living at the time of [[Pliny the Elder]] and was said to be as old as the city.<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XVI 236.</ref> The hypothesis has been presented that the ''Volcanal'' was founded when the Forum was still outside the town walls.<ref name=\"G. Dum\u00e9zil p. 285\">G. Dum\u00e9zil ''La religione romana arcaica'' Milano Rizzoli 1977 p. 285.</ref>\n\nThe ''Volcanal'' was perhaps used as a cremation site, as suggested by the early use of the Forum as a burial site.<ref>Von Duhn ''Altitalische Gr\u00e4berkunde'' as cited by Samuel Ball Platner & Thomas Ashby''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' London 1928 p. 583-4.</ref> Livy mentions it twice, in 189 and 181 BC, for the prodigies of a rain of blood.<ref>Livy Ab Urbe Condita Libri XL 19, 2.</ref>\n \nThe ''area Volcani'' was probably a ''locus substructus''. It was five meters higher than the [[Comitium]]<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiquitates  Romanae'' II 50, 2.</ref> and from it the kings and the magistrates of the beginnings of the republic addressed the people, before the building of the [[rostra]].<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiquitates  Romanae'' XI 39, 1.</ref>\n\nOn the Volcanal there was also a statue of [[Horatius Cocles]]<ref>Plutarch ''Publicola'', 16</ref> that had been moved here from the [[Comitium]], ''locus inferior'', after it had been struck by lightning. [[Aulus Gellius]] writes that some [[haruspices]] were summoned to expiate the prodigy and they had it moved to a lower site, where sunlight never reached, out of their hatred for the Romans. The fraud was revealed, however, and the haruspices were executed. Later it was found that the statue should be placed on a higher site, thus it was placed in the ''area Volcani''.<ref>Aulus Gellius ''Noct. Att.'' IV, 5; Gellius writes that the episode was recorded in the XI book of the [[Annales Maximi]] and by [[Verrius Flaccus]] ''Memorabilia'' I.</ref>\n\nIn 304 BC a sacellum to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] was built in the ''area Volcani'': it was dedicated by [[aedilis]] curulis [[Cnaeus Flavius]].<ref>Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'' IX 46.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], in the course of time the  ''Volcanal'' would have been more and more encroached upon by the surrounding buildings until it was totally covered over. Nonetheless the cult was still alive in the first half of the imperial era, as is testified by the finding of a dedica of Augustus's dating from 9 BC.<ref>CIL VI 457.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, behind the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] were found some ancient tufaceous foundations that probably belonged to the Volcanal and traces of a rocky platform, 3.95 meters long and 2.80 meters wide, that had been covered with concrete and painted in red. Into its upper surface are dug several narrow channels and in front of it are the remains of a draining channel made of tufaceous slabs. The hypothesis has been suggested that this was Vulcan's ''area'' itself. The rock shows signs of damages and repairs. On the surface there are some hollows, either round or square, that bear resemblance to graves and were interpreted as such in the past,<ref>Richter BRT iv 15\u201316.</ref> particularly by [[Von Duhn]]. After the discovery of cremation tombs in the Forum the latter scholar maintained that the Volcanal was originally the site where corpses were cremated.<ref>Von Duhn ''Italische Gr\u00e4berkunde'' i. 413 sqq.</ref>\n\nAnother temple was erected to the god before 215 BC in the [[Campus Martius]], near the [[Circus Flaminius]], where games in his honour were held during the festival of the Volcanalia.<ref name=\"G. Dum\u00e9zil p. 285\"/>\n\n==Outside Rome==\nAt [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] the cult of the god, as well as his ''sacerdos'', was the most important of the town. The sacerdos was named ''pontifex Vulcani et aedium sacrarum'': he had under his jurisdiction all the sacred buildings in town and could give or withhold the authorisation to erect new statues to Eastern divinities. He was chosen for life, perhaps by the council of the ''decuriones'', and his position was the equivalent of the [[pontifex maximus]] in Rome. It was the highest administrative position in the town of Ostia.\n\nHe was selected from among people who had already held public office in Ostia or in the imperial administration. The pontifex was the sole authority who had a number of subordinate officials to help discharge his duties, namely three ''praetores'' and two or three ''aediles''. These were religious offices, different from civil offices of similar name.<ref>C. Pavolini ''La vita quotidiana a Ostia'' Roma-Bari,1986</ref>\n\nOn the grounds of a fragmentary inscription found at [[Annaba]] (ancient Hippo Regius), it is considered possible that the writer [[Suetonius]] had held this office.<ref>AE 1953, 00073; G. Gaggero Introduction to Suetonius's ''Life of the twelve Caesars'' Milan 1994</ref>\n\nFrom [[Strabon]]<ref>Strabone ''Geografia. L'Italia'' V,4,6, Milan 1988</ref> we know that at Pozzuoli there was an area called in Greek ''agora' of Hephaistos'' (Lat. Forum Vulcani). The place is a plain where many sulphurous vapour outlets are located (currently ''Solfatara'').\n\nPliny the Elder records that near [[Modena]] fire came out from soil ''statis Vulcano  diebus'', on fixed days devoted to Vulcan.<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Nat.

While the festivals of July dealt with untamed nature (woods) and waters (superficial waters the Neptunalia and underground waters the Furrinalia) at a time of danger caused by their relative deficiency, those of August were devoted to the results of human endeavour on nature with the storing of harvested grain (Consualia) and their relationship to human society and regality (Opiconsivia) which at that time were at risk and required protection from the dangers of the  excessive strength of the two elements of fire (Vulcanalia) and wind (Vulturnalia) reinforced by dryness.<ref>In Dum\u00e9zil's interpretation the Vulturnalia were associated with the protection of riping grapes from a hot and dry southwestern wind named Vulturnus, not with the river Tiber, as Mommsen had supposed, or Vulturnus of Campania.</ref> \n \nIt is recorded that during the Vulcanalia people used to hang their clothes and fabrics under the sun.<ref>[[Paulinus of Nola]] ''Letters'' XXXII, 139.</ref> This habit might reflect a theological connection between Vulcan and the divinized Sun.<ref>G.

His cult is located outside the boundaries of the original city to avoid the risk of fires caused by the god in the city itself.<ref>Plutarch ''Questiones Romanae'' 47; Vitruvius ''De architectura'' I,7,1</ref>\n\nThis power is, however, considered useful if directed against enemies and such a choice for the location of the god's cult could be interpreted in this way too. The same idea underlies the dedication of the arms of the defeated enemies,<ref>Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 562.</ref> as well as those of the surviving general in a [[Loyalty|devotion]] ritual to the god.<ref>Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'' VIII 10.</ref>\n\nThrough comparative interpretation this aspect has been connected by Dum\u00e9zil to the third or defensive fire in the theory of the three Vedic sacrificial fires.<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 2, chap. 2; It. tr. Milan 1977 pp. 277\u2013280.</ref> In such theory three fires are necessary to the discharge of a religious ceremony: the hearth of the landlord, which has the function of establishing a referential on Earth in that precise location connecting it with Heaven; the sacrificial fire, which conveys the offer to Heaven; and the defensive fire, which is usually located on the southern boundary of the sacred space and has a protective function against evil influences. Since the territory of the city of Rome was seen as a magnified temple in itself, the three fires should be identified as the hearth of the landlord in the temple of Vesta (''aedes Vestae''); the sacrificial fires of each temple, shrine or altar; and the defensive fire in the temple of Vulcan.\n\nAnother meaning of Vulcan is related to male fertilizing power. In various Latin and Roman legends he is the father of famous characters, such as the founder of [[Praeneste]] [[Caeculus]],<ref>Cato Censor ''Origines'' fragment 65, cited in ''Scholia Veronensia ad Aeneidem'' VII 681 p. 438, 16 ff. Hagen.</ref> [[Cacus]],<ref>Vergil ''Aeneis'' VIII 198.</ref> a primordial being or king, later transformed into a monster that inhabited the site of the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] in Rome, and Roman king [[Servius Tullius]]. In a variant of the story of the birth of [[Romulus]] the details are identical even though Vulcan is not explicitly mentioned.<ref>Plutarch ''Romulus'' II 3\u20136</ref>\n\n[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Ixion.jpg|thumb|Punishment of [[Ixion]]: in the center is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the [[caduceus]] and on the right [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] sits on her throne.

In this case he would be the father of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].<ref>Jacqueline Champeaux ''Fortuna, I, Fortuna dans la religion romaine archaique'' Rome, 1982; A. Mastrocinque ''Romolo. La fondazione di Roma tra storia e leggenda'' Este, 1993.</ref> This view is though in conflict with that which links the goddess to Jupiter, as his daughter (''puer Jovis'') and his mother too, as ''primigenia'', meaning \"primordial\".\n\nIn all of the above-mentioned stories the god's fertilizing power is related to that of the fire of the house hearth.\n\nIn the case of Caeculus, his mother was impregnated by a spark that dropped on her womb from the hearth while she was sitting nearby.<ref>Vergil ''Aeneis'' VII 680.</ref> [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother [[Ocresia]] was impregnated by a male sex organ that miraculously appeared in the ashes of the sacrificial ara, at the order of [[Tanaquil]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]]'s wife.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 627.</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]] tells the same story, but states that the father was the [[Lares|Lar familiaris]].<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXVI 204.</ref> The divinity of the child was recognized when his head was surrounded by flames and he remained unharmed.<ref>Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 625\u2013636.</ref>\n\nThrough the comparative analysis of these myths archaeologist [[Andrea Carandini]] opines that [[Cacus]] and [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] were the sons of Vulcan and of a local divine being or a virgin as in the case of Caeculus. Cacus and Caca would represent the metallurgic and the domestic fire, projections of Vulcan and of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].\n\nThese legends date back to the time of preurban [[Latium]]. Their meaning is quite clear: at the divine level Vulcan impregnates a virgin goddess and generates Jupiter, the king of the gods; at the human level he impregnates a local virgin (perhaps of royal descent) and generates a king.<ref>Andrea Carandini ''La nascita di Roma'' Turin, 1997, p. 52.</ref>\n\nThe first mention of a ritual connection between Vulcan and Vesta is the [[lectisternium]] of 217 BC. Other facts that seem to hint at this connection are the relative proximity of the two sanctuaries and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]'s testimony that both cults had been introduced to Rome by [[Titus Tatius]] to comply with a vow he had made in battle.<ref>Dionysius Halicarnasseus ''Antiquitates Romanae'' II 50, 3.</ref> [[Varro]] confirms the fact.<ref>Varro ''Lingua Latina '' V 73: see above.</ref>\n\nVulcan is related to two equally ancient female goddesses [[Stata Mater]],<ref>CIL VI, 00802, found in Rome.</ref> perhaps the goddess who stops fires and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]].<ref>Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XII 23, 2: \"Maiam Volcani\".</ref>\n\n[[Herbert Jennings Rose]] interprets Maia as a goddess related to growth by connecting her name with IE root *MAG.<ref>H. J. Rose ''A dictionary of classical antiquities'' It. transl., Turin, 1995.</ref> [[Macrobius]] relates Cincius's opinion that Vulcan's female companion is Maia.

In Piso's view the companion of the god is [[Maia (mythology)|Maiestas]].<ref>Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 12, 18.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Gellius]] as well, Maia was associated with Vulcan; and he backs up his view by quoting the ritual prayers in use by Roman priests.<ref>A.

XIII, 23, 2</ref><ref>Maiestas and Maia, though, are possibly the same divine person: compare Ovid's explanations of the meaning of the name of the month May in his ''Fasti'': V 1\u201352 Maiestas; 81\u2013106 Maia both as possible eponyms of May.</ref>\n\nThe god is the patron of trades related to ovens (cooks, bakers, confectioners) as attested in the works of [[Plautus]],<ref>Plautus ''Aulularia'' 359.</ref> [[Apuleius]] (the god is the cook at the wedding of [[Amor and Psyche]])<ref>Apuleius ''Metamorphoses'' VI 24, 2.</ref> and in [[Vespa]]'s short poem in the [[Anthologia Latina]] about the litigation between a cook and a baker.<ref>''Iudicium coci et pistoris iudice Vulcano''.</ref>\n\n==Sons==\nAccording to [[Hyginus]]' Fabulae, the sons of Vulcan are Philammon, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]], Corynetes, Cercyon, Philottus, and Spinther.<ref>Hyginus Fabulae 158.</ref>\n\n==Hypothetical origin==\nThe origin of the Roman god of fire Vulcan has been traced back to the Cretan god [[Velchanos]] by G\u00e9rard Capdeville, primarily under the suggestion of the close similarity of their names.<ref>G. Capdeville ''Volcanus. Rech\u00e9rches comparatistes sur le cult de Vulcain'' Rome 1994. Reviewed by Bernard Sergent in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''216''' 1999 4 p. 475-481; Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge in ''Kernos'' 1996 '''9''' p. 434-436.</ref> Cretan Velchanos is a young god of Mediterranean or Near Eastern origin who has mastership of fire and is the companion of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]]. These traits are  preserved in Latium only in his sons [[Cacus]], [[Caeculus]], [[Romulus]] and [[Servius Tullius]]. At Praeneste the uncles of Caeculus are known as Digiti,<ref>Solinus II 9; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 41, 1; 43, 3.</ref> noun that connects them to the Cretan ''[[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyl]]i''.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=November 2017}}\n\nHis theology would be reflected in the Greek myths of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]] and in those concerning the childhood of [[Zeus]] on [[Mount Ida]]. The Mediterranean Pregreek conception is apparent in the depiction of Velchanos as a young man sitting upon a fork of a tree on coins from [[Phaistos]] dating from 322 to 300 BC, showing him as a god of vegetation and springtime: the tree is the symbol of the union of Heaven and Earth and their generative power, i. e. the site of the union of the god and the goddess. Otherwise Earth would be symbolised in the tree and Heaven in the double axe of the god. Later Velchanos was depicted as a bull as testified in the myths of [[Pasiphae]] and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. The Greeks misunderstood the meaning of the bull as for them the symbol of Zeus was a bird: the cock, the cuckoo or the eagle. Theseus brought to [[Delos]] the dance named ''g\u00e9ranos'' (literally the dance of the crane) which Capdeville connects with ''Garanos'', a variant of the ''[[Recaranus]]''  of  Italic myths. B. Sergent remarks that such an inquiry needs to include the ''Tarvos Trigaranos'' (the ''bull of the three horns'') of Gaul.\n\nIn Crete, Velchanos was the god of initiatory practices of youngsters.<ref>G. Capdeville \"Jeux athletiques et rituels de fondation\" Publications de L' \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise de Rome 1993 p. 141-187.</ref>\n\nAnother reflection of the tradition of the Cretan Velchanos-Zeus would be found in [[Argolid]] in the mysteries of [[Zeus Lykaios]], which contemplated anthropophagy and may have inspired the Italic [[Lupercalia]].\n\nThe theological profile of Velchanos looks identical to that of ''[[Jupiter Dolichenus]]'', a god of primarily [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] ascendence in his identification with the bull, who has Sumero-Accadic, Aramaic and Hittito-Hurrite features as a god of tempest, according for example to the researches conducted in Syria by French scholar Paul Merlat. His cult enjoyed a period of popularity in the Roman Empire during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and the god had a temple in Rome on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]].<ref>Paul Merlat ''Jupiter Dolichenus, Essai d'int\u00e9rpretation et de synth\u00e8se'' Paris PUF 1960 reviewed by [[Alfred Merlin]] \"Jupiter Dolichenus\" in ''Journal des savants'' 1960 '''4''' p. 160-166.</ref>\n\n==Foundation of Rome==\n\nVelchanos was the supreme god of early Cretan religion, where the festival of the \u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 (Velchania) as well as a month \u03dc\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3 (Welchanios) are attested: a gloss by Hesychius states that \"Velchanos is Zeus among the Cretan\".<ref>Hesychius \u0393 315 Latte.</ref> He was the first god of the cavern of [[Mount Ida]], where he had an oracle, and was honoured also in Cyprus.\n\nHis name is very similar to that of Latin god Volcanus, who himself was considered to be the father of [[Caeculus]] and [[Servius Tullius]], not to mention Romulus in the version transmitted by Promathion, which is very similar to the legend of Servius.\n\nThe founder of Rome has a close relationship with this god as he founded the ''Volcanal'' and there he dedicated a quadriga with his own statue  after his first victory. It is there too that a part of the tradition locates the place of his death: the site was marked by the [[Lapis Niger]]: Festus writes \"Niger lapis in Comitio  locum funestum significat, ut ali, Romuli morti destinatum...\". On the day of the [[Volcanalia]] (August 23) a sacrifice was offered to Hora Quirini, paredra of [[Quirinus]] with whom  the deified Romulus was identified. As the Consualia were mentioned first in connection with the founding of Rome in the episode of the abduction of the Sabine women, as the Volcanalia are celebrated two days later and two days before the ''Opiconsivia'', and as the name Volcanus resembles that of the ancient Cretan god honoured in the \u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7?\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 who presided over initiation rites, the Consualia must have a meaning of integration into the citizenship. This provides an explanation for the choice of the festival of the ''[[Parilia]] '' as the date of the foundation of Rome, since these are first of all the festival of the ''iuniores''. Festus writes: \"Parilibus  Romulus Vrbem condidit, quem diem festum praecipue habebant iuniores.\" The date of April 21 marked the starting point of the process of initiation of the future new citizens which concluded four months later on the ceremony of the Consualia, which involves athletic games and marriages.<ref>G. Capdeville \"Jeux athl\u00e9tiques et rituels de fondation\" ''Publications de l'\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise de Rome'' 1993 p. 182-186.</ref>\n\n==Greek myths of Hephaestus==\n\nThrough his identification with the [[Hephaestus]] of [[Greek mythology]], Vulcan came to be considered as the manufacturer of art, arms, [[iron]], jewelry, and armor for various gods and heroes, including the lightning bolts of Jupiter. He was the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and the husband of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] and [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite (Venus)]]. His [[Forge|smithy]] was believed to be situated underneath [[Mount Etna]] in [[Sicily]].\n[[File:\u041f\u0456\u0442\u044d\u0440 \u0422\u044b\u0437. \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u045e \u043a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0456 \u0412\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430. XVII \u0441\u0442..jpg|thumb|208px|left|''Venus in the Forge of Vulcan'' by [[Pieter Thijs]]]]\nAs the son of Jupiter, the king of the gods, and Juno, the queen of the gods, Vulcan should have been quite handsome, but baby Vulcan was small and ugly with a red, bawling face. Juno was so horrified that she hurled the tiny baby off the top of [[Mount Olympus]].\n\nVulcan fell down for a day and a night, landing in the sea. Unfortunately, one of his legs broke as he hit the water, and never developed properly. Vulcan sank to the depths of the ocean,  where the sea-nymph [[Thetis]] found him and took him to her underwater grotto, wanting to raise him as her own son.\n\nVulcan had a happy childhood with dolphins as his playmates and pearls as his toys. Late in his childhood, he found the remains of a fisherman's fire on the beach and became fascinated with an unextinguished coal, still red-hot and glowing.\n\nVulcan carefully shut this precious coal in a clamshell, took it back to his underwater grotto, and made a fire with it. On the first day after that, Vulcan stared at this fire for hours on end. On the second day, he discovered that when he made the fire hotter with bellows, certain stones sweated iron, silver or gold. On the third day he beat the cooled metal into shapes: bracelets, chains, swords and shields. Vulcan made pearl-handled knives and spoons for his foster mother, and for himself he made a silver chariot with bridles so that seahorses could transport him quickly. He even made slave-girls of gold to wait on him and do his bidding.\n\nLater, Thetis left her underwater grotto to attend a dinner party on Mount Olympus wearing a beautiful necklace of silver and sapphires that Vulcan had made for her. Juno admired the necklace and asked where she could get one. Thetis became flustered, causing Juno to become suspicious; and, at last, the queen god discovered the truth: the baby she had once rejected had grown into a talented [[blacksmith]].\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez - La Fragua de Vulcano (Museo del Prado, 1630).jpg|thumb|right|''The Forge of Vulcan'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], (1630).]]\n\nJuno was furious and demanded that Vulcan return home, a demand that he refused. However, he did send Juno a beautifully constructed chair made of silver and gold, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Juno was delighted with this gift but, as soon as she sat in it her weight triggered hidden springs and metal bands sprung forth to hold her fast. The more she shrieked and struggled the more firmly the mechanical throne gripped her; the chair was a cleverly designed trap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=37}}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=January 2020|reason=the story does not appear in the work cited, which in any case is an old popular work of dubious reliability}}\n\nFor three days Juno sat fuming, still trapped in Vulcan's chair; she could not sleep, she could not stretch, she could not eat. It was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] who finally saved the day: he promised that if Vulcan released Juno he would give him a wife, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] the goddess of love and beauty. Vulcan agreed and married Venus. He later built a smithy under [[Mount Etna]] on the island of [[Sicily]]. It was said that whenever Venus was unfaithful, Vulcan grew angry and beat the red-hot metal with such a force that sparks and smoke rose up from the top of the mountain, creating a volcanic eruption.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to [[Virgil]], Vulcan was the father of [[Caeculus]].<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Verg.+A.+7.678 7.678\u2013681]; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Serv.+A.+7.678&fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0053 7.678].</ref>\n\nTo punish mankind for stealing the secrets of fire, Jupiter ordered the other gods to make a poisoned gift for man. Vulcan's contribution to the beautiful and foolish [[Pandora]] was to mould her from clay and to give her form. He also made the thrones for the other gods on [[Mount Olympus]].\n\n==Sanctuaries==\nThe main and most ancient sanctuary of Vulcan in Rome was the ''Volcanal'', located in the ''area Volcani'', an open-air space at the foot of the [[Capitolium]], in the northwestern corner of the [[Roman Forum]], with an area dedicated to the god and a perennial fire. It was one of the most ancient Roman shrines.<ref>Cf. above note 10, 11 and 12.</ref>\nAccording to Roman tradititon the sanctuary had been dedicated by [[Romulus]]. He had placed on the site a bronze [[quadriga]] dedicated to the god, a war trophy from the [[Fidenates]]. According to Plutarch, though, the war in question was that against [[Cameria]], that occurred sixteen years after the foundation of Rome.<ref name=\"Plutarch Romulus 24\">Plutarch ''Romulus'' 24.</ref> There Romulus would have also dedicated to Vulcan a statue of himself and an inscription in Greek characters listing  his successes.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antitquitites'' II 54, 2.</ref> Plutarch states that Romulus was represented crowned by [[Victory]].<ref name=\"Plutarch Romulus 24\"/> Moreover, he would have planted a sacred lotus tree<ref>The Italic lotus, ''diospyrus lotus'', or ''melilotus'', [[Columella]]  ''De Re Rustica'' VII 9; [[Galen]].</ref> in the sanctuary that was still living at the time of [[Pliny the Elder]] and was said to be as old as the city.<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XVI 236.</ref> The hypothesis has been presented that the ''Volcanal'' was founded when the Forum was still outside the town walls.<ref name=\"G.

[[Aulus Gellius]] writes that some [[haruspices]] were summoned to expiate the prodigy and they had it moved to a lower site, where sunlight never reached, out of their hatred for the Romans. The fraud was revealed, however, and the haruspices were executed. Later it was found that the statue should be placed on a higher site, thus it was placed in the ''area Volcani''.<ref>Aulus Gellius ''Noct. Att.'' IV, 5; Gellius writes that the episode was recorded in the XI book of the [[Annales Maximi]] and by [[Verrius Flaccus]] ''Memorabilia'' I.</ref>\n\nIn 304 BC a sacellum to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] was built in the ''area Volcani'': it was dedicated by [[aedilis]] curulis [[Cnaeus Flavius]].<ref>Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'' IX 46.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], in the course of time the  ''Volcanal'' would have been more and more encroached upon by the surrounding buildings until it was totally covered over. Nonetheless the cult was still alive in the first half of the imperial era, as is testified by the finding of a dedica of Augustus's dating from 9 BC.<ref>CIL VI 457.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, behind the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] were found some ancient tufaceous foundations that probably belonged to the Volcanal and traces of a rocky platform, 3.95 meters long and 2.80 meters wide, that had been covered with concrete and painted in red. Into its upper surface are dug several narrow channels and in front of it are the remains of a draining channel made of tufaceous slabs. The hypothesis has been suggested that this was Vulcan's ''area'' itself. The rock shows signs of damages and repairs. On the surface there are some hollows, either round or square, that bear resemblance to graves and were interpreted as such in the past,<ref>Richter BRT iv 15\u201316.</ref> particularly by [[Von Duhn]]. After the discovery of cremation tombs in the Forum the latter scholar maintained that the Volcanal was originally the site where corpses were cremated.<ref>Von Duhn ''Italische Gr\u00e4berkunde'' i. 413 sqq.</ref>\n\nAnother temple was erected to the god before 215 BC in the [[Campus Martius]], near the [[Circus Flaminius]], where games in his honour were held during the festival of the Volcanalia.<ref name=\"G. Dum\u00e9zil p. 285\"/>\n\n==Outside Rome==\nAt [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] the cult of the god, as well as his ''sacerdos'', was the most important of the town. The sacerdos was named ''pontifex Vulcani et aedium sacrarum'': he had under his jurisdiction all the sacred buildings in town and could give or withhold the authorisation to erect new statues to Eastern divinities. He was chosen for life, perhaps by the council of the ''decuriones'', and his position was the equivalent of the [[pontifex maximus]] in Rome. It was the highest administrative position in the town of Ostia.\n\nHe was selected from among people who had already held public office in Ostia or in the imperial administration. The pontifex was the sole authority who had a number of subordinate officials to help discharge his duties, namely three ''praetores'' and two or three ''aediles''. These were religious offices, different from civil offices of similar name.<ref>C. Pavolini ''La vita quotidiana a Ostia'' Roma-Bari,1986</ref>\n\nOn the grounds of a fragmentary inscription found at [[Annaba]] (ancient Hippo Regius), it is considered possible that the writer [[Suetonius]] had held this office.<ref>AE 1953, 00073; G. Gaggero Introduction to Suetonius's ''Life of the twelve Caesars'' Milan 1994</ref>\n\nFrom [[Strabon]]<ref>Strabone ''Geografia.

The place is a plain where many sulphurous vapour outlets are located (currently ''Solfatara'').\n\nPliny the Elder records that near [[Modena]] fire came out from soil ''statis Vulcano  diebus'', on fixed days devoted to Vulcan.<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Nat.
