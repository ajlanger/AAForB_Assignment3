She was the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and the mother of [[Prince William]] and [[Prince Harry]]. Diana's activism and glamour made her an international icon and earned her an enduring popularity as well as an unprecedented public scrutiny, exacerbated by her tumultuous private life.\n\nDiana was born into the [[British nobility]] and grew up close to the royal family on their [[Sandringham estate]]. The youngest daughter of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer]], and [[Frances Shand Kydd]], she was strongly affected by their divorce in 1967. She did not distinguish herself academically, but was talented in music, dance, and sports. In 1978, she moved to London, where she lived with flatmates and took on various low-paying jobs.\n\nDiana came to prominence in 1981 upon her engagement to Prince Charles, the eldest son of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], after a brief courtship. [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|Their wedding]] took place at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1981 and made her [[Princess of Wales]], a role in which she was enthusiastically received by the public. The couple had two sons, the princes William and Harry, who were then second and third in the [[line of succession to the British throne]]. Diana's marriage to Charles, however, suffered due to their incompatibility and extramarital affairs. The couple separated in 1992, soon after the breakdown of their relationship became public knowledge. The details of their marital difficulties became increasingly publicised, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1996.\n\nAs Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions across the [[Commonwealth realms]]. She was celebrated in the media for her unconventional approach to charity work. Her patronages initially centered on children and youth but she later became known for her involvement with [[AIDS]] patients and campaign for the removal of landmines. She also raised awareness and advocated ways to help people affected with cancer and mental illness. As princess, Diana was initially noted for her shyness, but her charisma and friendliness endeared her to the public and helped her reputation survive the acrimonious collapse of her marriage. Considered to be very photogenic, she was a leader of fashion in the 1980s and 1990s. Media attention and public mourning were extensive after [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in a car crash]] in a Paris tunnel in 1997 and subsequent [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|televised funeral]]. Her legacy has had a deep impact on the royal family and British society.\n\n==Early life==\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House, [[Sandringham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=70}} She was the fourth of five children of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer|John Spencer, Viscount Althorp]] (1924\u20131992), and [[Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp]] ([[n\u00e9e]] [[Baron Fermoy|Roche]]; 1936\u20132004).{{sfn|Morton |1997|pp=70\u201371}} The [[Spencer family]] had been closely allied with the [[British royal family]] for several generations;{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=32\u201333}} Diana's grandmothers, [[Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer]] and [[Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy]], had served as [[ladies-in-waiting]] to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=2}} The Spencers were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her mother and after [[Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford|Lady Diana Spencer]], a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales.{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}}\n\nOn 30 August 1961,<ref name=\"Time-Christening\">{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1650830_1650872_1653713-1,00.html |title=The Saddest Fairy Tale |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=16 August 2007 |accessdate=3 February 2017 |first=Howard |last=Chua-Eoan |quote=...{{nbsp}}she died, suddenly, the day after the 36th anniversary of her christening{{nbsp}}... |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203163156/http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0%2C28804%2C1650830_1650872_1653713-1%2C00.html |archivedate=3 February 2017 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Diana was baptised at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]].{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} She grew up with three siblings: [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], [[Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes|Jane]], and [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=37\u201338}} Her infant brother, John, died shortly after his birth one year before Diana was born.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=37}} The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to [[Harley Street]] clinics in London to determine the cause of the \"problem\".{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} The experience was described as \"humiliating\" by Diana's younger brother, Charles: \"It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it.\"{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the [[Sandringham estate]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=41}} The Spencers leased the house from its owner, [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

She was the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and the mother of [[Prince William]] and [[Prince Harry]]. Diana's activism and glamour made her an international icon and earned her an enduring popularity as well as an unprecedented public scrutiny, exacerbated by her tumultuous private life.\n\nDiana was born into the [[British nobility]] and grew up close to the royal family on their [[Sandringham estate]]. The youngest daughter of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer]], and [[Frances Shand Kydd]], she was strongly affected by their divorce in 1967. She did not distinguish herself academically, but was talented in music, dance, and sports. In 1978, she moved to London, where she lived with flatmates and took on various low-paying jobs.\n\nDiana came to prominence in 1981 upon her engagement to Prince Charles, the eldest son of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], after a brief courtship. [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|Their wedding]] took place at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1981 and made her [[Princess of Wales]], a role in which she was enthusiastically received by the public. The couple had two sons, the princes William and Harry, who were then second and third in the [[line of succession to the British throne]]. Diana's marriage to Charles, however, suffered due to their incompatibility and extramarital affairs. The couple separated in 1992, soon after the breakdown of their relationship became public knowledge. The details of their marital difficulties became increasingly publicised, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1996.\n\nAs Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions across the [[Commonwealth realms]]. She was celebrated in the media for her unconventional approach to charity work. Her patronages initially centered on children and youth but she later became known for her involvement with [[AIDS]] patients and campaign for the removal of landmines. She also raised awareness and advocated ways to help people affected with cancer and mental illness. As princess, Diana was initially noted for her shyness, but her charisma and friendliness endeared her to the public and helped her reputation survive the acrimonious collapse of her marriage. Considered to be very photogenic, she was a leader of fashion in the 1980s and 1990s. Media attention and public mourning were extensive after [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in a car crash]] in a Paris tunnel in 1997 and subsequent [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|televised funeral]].
