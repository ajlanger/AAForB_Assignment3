Prynne's church was rebuilt, and the new building consecrated in 1882, without disturbance. Although he remained a Tractarian to the end, he was chosen with Prebendary Sadler proctor in convocation for the clergy of the Exeter diocese from 1885 to 1892, and despite their divergence of opinion he was on friendly terms with his diocesans, [[Frederick Temple]] and [[Edward Bickersteth]]. Unlike some other ritualists, he submitted to the Lambeth judgment of 1899, by the archbishops [[William Dalrymple Maclagan]] and [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]], that condemned the liturgical use of [[incense]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref>{{cite ODNB|id=34773|first=Ian|last=Machin|title=Maclagan, William Dalrymple}}</ref>\n\nPrynne died at his vicarage after a short illness on 25 March 1903, and was buried at [[Plympton St Mary]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n[[File:Grave of the Revd George Rundle Prynne.jpg|thumb|Grave of George Rundle Prynne]]\n\n==Works==\nPrynne's major work was ''The Eucharistic Manual'', 1865 (tenth and last edit. 1895); it was censured by the primate, Archbishop [[Charles Longley]]. He was also author of ''Truth and Reality of the Eucharistic Sacrifice'' (1894) and ''Devotional Instructions on the Eucharistic Office'' (1903). Other prose works consisted of sermons and doctrinal or controversial tracts.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAs a writer of hymns Prynne enjoyed a reputation. ''A Hymnal'' compiled by him in 1875 contains his well-known \"Jesu, meek and gentle\", written in 1856, and some translations of Latin hymns. He also took part in the revision of ''[[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]'', and published ''The Soldier's Dying Visions, and other Poems and Hymns'' (1881) and ''Via Dolorosa'' in prose, on the [[Stations of the Cross]] (1901).<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Family==\nPrynne married on 17 April 1849 Emily (died 1901), daughter of Admiral [[Sir Thomas Fellowes]], and they had a family of four sons and six daughters.
