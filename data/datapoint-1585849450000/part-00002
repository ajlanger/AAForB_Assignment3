The primary mechanisms used in this regard are extradition, lawful removal, and mutual legal assistance.<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/>\n\nExtradition is the mechanism by which one sovereign requests and obtains custody of a fugitive located within the jurisdiction and control of another sovereign.  It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the thirteenth century BCE, when an Egyptian Pharaoh negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite King.  Through the extradition process, a sovereign (the requesting state) typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (the requested state).  If the fugitive is found within the territory of the requested state, then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process. The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state.<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/>\n\nAside from mechanisms for the return of fugitives, states have also developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of legal assistance, such as witness statements or the service of documents, are needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically referred to as requests for \"mutual legal assistance\"<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/> The practice of mutual legal assistance developed from the comity-based system of letters rogatory, though it is now far more common for states to make mutual legal assistance requests directly to the designated \"Central Authorities\" within each state.  In contemporary practice, such requests may still be made on the basis of reciprocity but may also be made pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties that obligate countries to provide assistance.  Many countries are able to provide a broad range of mutual legal assistance to other countries even in the absence of a treaty.<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/>\n\nThe financial crime expert Veit Buetterlin explained that transnational crime types such as counterfeiting, smuggling, human trafficking, drug trafficking, illegal logging, illegal mining, or illegal wildlife trade can only be effective if the involved crime networks can launder the proceeds.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/living-markets/videos/fighting-war-against-terrorist-financing |title = Fighting the war against terrorist financing}}</ref> He also mentioned that the international community needs to overcome a state where \u201ccriminals act internationally, while prosecutors stop at borders.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.moneylaunderingbulletin.com/legalandregulatory/practicefindings/defence-review---germany-video-134627.htm?origin=internalSearch |title = Defence review - Germany &#91;Video&#93; - Money Laundering Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n==Torture==\n{{see also|Torture}}\n{{quote|There can be few issues on which international legal opinion is more clear than on the condemnation of torture.
