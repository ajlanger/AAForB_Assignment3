It is the commercial centre to an irrigation district based on livestock, horticulture, [[cytisus proliferus|lucerne]] and grain.  It is located {{convert|279|km|mi}} north-west of [[Melbourne]] on the [[Murray Valley Highway]] a few kilometres north of its intersection with the [[Loddon Valley Highway]], elevation {{convert|78|m|ft}}. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, Kerang had a population of 3,893.<ref name=\"abs\"/> ''Kerang'' is believed to be an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word for [[Cockatoo]]. It is home to the largest solar and battery farm in the country which was opened in June 2019. The 50-megawatt battery system is located outside of Kerang and stores 100 per cent renewable energy. The 2,000 solar panels have become a tourist attraction and are drawing many businesses to the town.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-14/australias-largest-solar-and-battery-farm-opens-in-kerang/11209666|title=Australia's largest solar and battery farm opens in Kerang, improves energy security|last=|first=|date=14 June 2019|work=ABC News|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\nThe [[Wemba-Wemba]] [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal people]] are thought to have been the area's first occupants. [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to visit the area, in 1836. [[Squatters]] began to settle in the area in 1845 and in 1848 Richard Beyes opened a public house at a river crossing near the future townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In 1857 Woodford Patchell built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become Kerang. Patchell was the first farmer in the state to use [[irrigation]] and experimented with oats, barley, maize, millet, tobacco, beet, cotton and sugarcane. The Post Office opened on 29 July 1858; the current [[Kerang Post Office]] building dates from 1886 and is heritage-listed. An earlier Kerang office, quite distant, was renamed [[Wedderburn, Victoria|Wedderburn]] on the same day.<ref name = \"a\">{{Citation\n  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nKerang was declared a shire in 1871; at the time the settlement's population was 109. The arrival of the railway from [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] in 1884 and the construction of a [[Kerang-Koondrook Tramway|tramway to Koondrook]] in 1888 led to expansion; by 1891 the population had increased to over a thousand.
