Noor was killed with a [[Stanley knife]] wielded by Charlotte and struck with a hammer by Linda following a confrontation with the sisters and their mother, Kathleen Mulhall. His head and penis were sliced off and the rest of his corpse dismembered by the women and dumped in [[Dublin]]'s [[Royal Canal]] where a piece of leg still wearing a sock was spotted floating near [[Croke Park]] ten days later.\n\nThe subsequent manhunt and the trial in October 2006 attracted intense media attention in Ireland as the true details of the crime slowly emerged. The sisters and their mother were arrested but released until Linda confessed to involvement in the crime. Kathleen Mulhall left the country at this point to live in England. When Charlotte and Linda were charged with murder in December 2005, their father, John Mulhall, hanged himself in [[Phoenix Park]]. As a result of the method they used to carry out the killing of Farah Swaleh Noor, Linda and Charlotte Mulhall were dubbed the ''Scissor Sisters'' by the media, after the pop rock band the [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref name=\"'Scissor' mother dated rapist after fleeing to UK\"/><ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/><ref name=\"Scissor Sister reveals head put in bins in Phoenix Park\"/> Justice [[Paul Carney]], presiding over the trial, said during sentencing that it was \"the most grotesque killing that has occurred in my professional lifetime\".<ref name=\"A horror story born out of dysfunction\"/> Charlotte Mulhall was given the mandatory life sentence and Linda Mulhall was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter, with both being sent to [[D\u00f3chas Centre|Mountjoy Women's prison]] in Dublin.\n\nNoor's head and penis were never recovered,<ref name=\"Mulhall sister sentenced to life (2)\"/> although Linda later admitted they had put the head in rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to [[Tallaght]] and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was [[sectioned]]. Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to [[Limerick]]. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges. She pleaded guilty to helping clean up the crime scene to conceal evidence and was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2009.\n\nThe case has resulted in several books and has been examined in at least one television series. It was said by the ''[[Irish Independent]]''{{'}}s legal affairs correspondent Dearbhail McDonald to have \"fuelled fears of ritual killings in Ireland\".<ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/>\n\n==Mulhall family background==\nThe Mulhalls were from Kilclare Gardens, a working class area in [[Tallaght]], south [[Dublin]]. Their parents John and Kathleen Mulhall raised a family of three boys and three girls. John Mulhall allegedly abused Kathleen. Their marriage broke down and Kathleen entered into a relationship with Farah Swaleh Noor in 2002. Noor moved into their family home with Kathleen, and John Mulhall took some of his children and moved out. He rented various accommodations in Dublin over a period of a year, then moved back into the home after Kathleen left and moved to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with Noor. Kathleen and Noor returned to Dublin in 2004. Noor allegedly subjected Kathleen Mulhall to regular beatings.<ref name=\"Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1018/ireland/cwidkfojeyql |title=Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer|date=18 October 2006 |publisher=breakingnews.ie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614133636/http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1018/ireland/cwidkfojeyql/ |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse\">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0506/1224245993737.html|title=Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=4 September 2009|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Linda Mulhall===\nLinda Mulhall was 30 years old at the time of the killing.

The abuse was later investigated, and the children were taken into care by the social services, while Wayne Kinsella served a six-year prison sentence for his cruelty to the children. Kinsella himself had an extremely violent history, having been thrown out of school for violent behaviour, according to his elder sister, Donna. In a 2013 [[RT\u00c9 Radio]] interview, Donna Kinsella said that her brother Wayne was always an extremely violent person, even during his childhood, and stated that he used to beat members of his own family, including his parents, and had broken her jaw on one occasion.<ref name=\"Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail\">{{cite web|author=Conor Feehan Security Editor|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/dont-ever-let-my-doublekiller-brother-out-of-jail/|title='Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail'|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=14 September 2016|publisher=[[Herald]]}}</ref>  In May 1996, Kinsella received an eight-year prison sentence for the murder of a retired auctioneer, Thomas Foreman, who was killed while visiting his wife's grave in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] in Dublin on 23 September 1995.

Subsequent investigations revealed that he was in fact [[Kenya]]n and that his family was still alive. Farah was ethnically [[Somalis|Somali]]. The [[Department of Justice and Equality|Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform]] ordered that he be deported but he appealed and was granted Irish citizenship in March 1999 on grounds he became the father of an Irish-born child. He had four previous convictions for offences including [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], threatening and abusive behaviour and assault. In 1997, he [[rape]]d a mentally disabled 16-year-old Chinese girl. She later gave birth to a son.

Farah bought [[vodka]] and Kathleen Mulhall purchased [[Coca-Cola]] which they drank as they walked around the city before stopping on the [[River Liffey]] Boardwalk where Charlotte and her mother took [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy tablets]]. They returned to Kathleen Mulhall's flat where the women took ecstasy.

Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to \"just kill him for me\". Charlotte picked up a [[Stanley knife]] and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that sent him to the ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but did not participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times.

Noor's head, [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and [[penis]] were severed using a kitchen knife and hammer. They put towels over his legs to stem the flow of blood. The dismemberment took a number of hours and the body parts were placed in black plastic bags and a sports bag before being disposed of in the [[Royal Canal]]. This took the three women several trips. They decided not to throw the head in to prevent identification. The head was brought by bus to Tallaght where they walked through [[The Square, Tallaght|The Square Shopping Centre]] to Tymon North Park. They walked to where Charlotte dug a hole with a knife to bury the head. Kathleen Mulhall threw the knives and the hammer into a nearby pond. A number of days later, Linda Mulhall allegedly returned to the park and dug up the head. Using her son's schoolbag, she transferred it to a field in the Killinarden Estate, Tallaght, where she broke it up with a hammer before burying it again.<ref name=\"Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer\" />\n\n==Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na investigation==\nThe killing only came to light ten days later when Noor's leg, with a sock on the end, was seen floating in the canal, a few hundred yards from [[Croke Park]]. [[Garda Water Unit|Garda sub-aqua divers]] retrieved most of the rest of his body in seven parts. Garda\u00ed traced his identity through media appeals. Noor was only identified when someone recognised a T-shirt on the recovered torso.

Noor was killed with a [[Stanley knife]] wielded by Charlotte and struck with a hammer by Linda following a confrontation with the sisters and their mother, Kathleen Mulhall. His head and penis were sliced off and the rest of his corpse dismembered by the women and dumped in [[Dublin]]'s [[Royal Canal]] where a piece of leg still wearing a sock was spotted floating near [[Croke Park]] ten days later.\n\nThe subsequent manhunt and the trial in October 2006 attracted intense media attention in Ireland as the true details of the crime slowly emerged. The sisters and their mother were arrested but released until Linda confessed to involvement in the crime. Kathleen Mulhall left the country at this point to live in England. When Charlotte and Linda were charged with murder in December 2005, their father, John Mulhall, hanged himself in [[Phoenix Park]]. As a result of the method they used to carry out the killing of Farah Swaleh Noor, Linda and Charlotte Mulhall were dubbed the ''Scissor Sisters'' by the media, after the pop rock band the [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref name=\"'Scissor' mother dated rapist after fleeing to UK\"/><ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/><ref name=\"Scissor Sister reveals head put in bins in Phoenix Park\"/> Justice [[Paul Carney]], presiding over the trial, said during sentencing that it was \"the most grotesque killing that has occurred in my professional lifetime\".<ref name=\"A horror story born out of dysfunction\"/> Charlotte Mulhall was given the mandatory life sentence and Linda Mulhall was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter, with both being sent to [[D\u00f3chas Centre|Mountjoy Women's prison]] in Dublin.\n\nNoor's head and penis were never recovered,<ref name=\"Mulhall sister sentenced to life (2)\"/> although Linda later admitted they had put the head in rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to [[Tallaght]] and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was [[sectioned]]. Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to [[Limerick]]. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges. She pleaded guilty to helping clean up the crime scene to conceal evidence and was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2009.\n\nThe case has resulted in several books and has been examined in at least one television series. It was said by the ''[[Irish Independent]]''{{'}}s legal affairs correspondent Dearbhail McDonald to have \"fuelled fears of ritual killings in Ireland\".<ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/>\n\n==Mulhall family background==\nThe Mulhalls were from Kilclare Gardens, a working class area in [[Tallaght]], south [[Dublin]]. Their parents John and Kathleen Mulhall raised a family of three boys and three girls. John Mulhall allegedly abused Kathleen. Their marriage broke down and Kathleen entered into a relationship with Farah Swaleh Noor in 2002. Noor moved into their family home with Kathleen, and John Mulhall took some of his children and moved out. He rented various accommodations in Dublin over a period of a year, then moved back into the home after Kathleen left and moved to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with Noor. Kathleen and Noor returned to Dublin in 2004. Noor allegedly subjected Kathleen Mulhall to regular beatings.<ref name=\"Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1018/ireland/cwidkfojeyql/#ixzz0Q31lk3sr|title=Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer|date=18 October 2006|accessdate=4 September 2009|publisher=breakingnews.ie}}</ref><ref name=\"Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse\">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0506/1224245993737.html|title=Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=4 September 2009|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Linda Mulhall===\nLinda Mulhall was 30 years old at the time of the killing.

Kinsella himself had an extremely violent history, having been thrown out of school for violent behaviour, according to his elder sister, Donna. In a 2013 [[RT\u00c9 Radio]] interview, Donna Kinsella said that her brother Wayne was always an extremely violent person, even during his childhood, and stated that he used to beat members of his own family, including his parents, and had broken her jaw on one occasion.<ref name=\"Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail\">{{cite web|author=Conor Feehan Security Editor|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/dont-ever-let-my-doublekiller-brother-out-of-jail/|title='Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail'|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=14 September 2016|publisher=[[Herald]]}}</ref>  In May 1996, Kinsella received an eight-year prison sentence for the murder of a retired auctioneer, Thomas Foreman, who was killed while visiting his wife's grave in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] in Dublin on 23 September 1995.
