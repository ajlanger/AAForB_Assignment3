Yamanouchi Yakuhin Shokai was started in 1923 by Kenji Yamanouchi in Osaka.  The company was renamed Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. in 1940 and moved to [[Tokyo]] in 1942. Both companies started their overseas expansion at about the same time, opening offices in [[Taiwan]] in 1962 and 1963, respectively, and in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] from 1977 onwards.\n\n===Recent times and mergers===\nFujisawa acquired Lyphomed in 1990 and thereafter established its US R&D center in [[Deerfield, Illinois]]. Yamanouchi's R&D center in [[Leiderdorp]] was established with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical division of Royal Gist Brocades in 1991. Fujisawa and Yamanouchi combined in a \"merger of equals,\" forming Astellas Pharma on 1 April 2005. At least some of its older products continue to be distributed under the original brand, ostensibly due to high brand-name recognition.<ref>\"Yamanouchi Pimafucin (natamycin) product line manufactured at least up to 11/2007\"</ref> Astellas had a collaboration agreement with CoMentis from 2008 to 2014 focused on development of [[BACE inhibitor|beta-secretase inhibitor]] therapeutics for [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Astellas Ends Alzehimer's Collaboration with CoMentis | date=November 15, 2014 | work=[[Gen.

In December 2014, Astellas expanded its 18-month-old collaboration with Cytokinetics, focusing on the R&D and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators. The companies announced they will advance the development of CK-2127107 (a fast skeletal troponin activator) into Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of [[spinal muscular atrophy]] and possibly other [[neuromuscular]] conditions. The companies have extended their R&D program focusing on the discovery of additional skeletal sarcomere activators through into 2016. The collaboration is expected to generate more than $600 million for Cytokinetics as well as $75 million in milestone payments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-cytokinetics-expand-muscle-drug-collaboration/81250735/|title=Astellas, Cytokinetics Expand Muscle Drug Collaboration - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> In November 2015 the company announced its move to acquire [[Ocata Therapeutics]] (formerly Advanced Cell Technology) for $379 million.<ref name=\"genengnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-to-acquire-ocata-therapeutics-for-379m/81251957/|title=Astellas to Acquire Ocata Therapeutics for $379M - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> As of January 14, 2016, Astellas has not been able to acquire a majority of Ocata's common stock, which is necessary to complete the acquisition.

Yamanouchi Yakuhin Shokai was started in 1923 by Kenji Yamanouchi in Osaka.  The company was renamed Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. in 1940 and moved to [[Tokyo]] in 1942. Both companies started their overseas expansion at about the same time, opening offices in [[Taiwan]] in 1962 and 1963, respectively, and in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] from 1977 onwards.\n\n===Recent times and mergers===\nFujisawa acquired Lyphomed in 1990 and thereafter established its US R&D center in [[Deerfield, Illinois]]. Yamanouchi's R&D center in [[Leiderdorp]] was established with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical division of Royal Gist Brocades in 1991. Fujisawa and Yamanouchi combined in a \"merger of equals,\" forming Astellas Pharma on 1 April 2005. At least some of its older products continue to be distributed under the original brand, ostensibly due to high brand-name recognition.<ref>\"Yamanouchi Pimafucin (natamycin) product line manufactured at least up to 11/2007\"</ref> Astellas had a collaboration agreement with CoMentis from 2008 to 2014 focused on development of [[BACE inhibitor|beta-secretase inhibitor]] therapeutics for [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Astellas Ends Alzehimer's Collaboration with CoMentis | date=November 15, 2014 | work=[[Gen.

In December 2014, Astellas expanded its 18-month-old collaboration with Cytokinetics, focusing on the R&D and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators. The companies announced they will advance the development of CK-2127107 (a fast skeletal troponin activator) into Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of [[spinal muscular atrophy]] and possibly other [[neuromuscular]] conditions. The companies have extended their R&D program focusing on the discovery of additional skeletal sarcomere activators through into 2016. The collaboration is expected to generate more than $600 million for Cytokinetics as well as $75 million in milestone payments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-cytokinetics-expand-muscle-drug-collaboration/81250735/|title=Astellas, Cytokinetics Expand Muscle Drug Collaboration - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> In November 2015 the company announced its move to acquire [[Ocata Therapeutics]] (formerly Advanced Cell Technology) for $379 million.<ref name=\"genengnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-to-acquire-ocata-therapeutics-for-379m/81251957/|title=Astellas to Acquire Ocata Therapeutics for $379M - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> As of January 14, 2016, Astellas has not been able to acquire a majority of Ocata's common stock, which is necessary to complete the acquisition.
