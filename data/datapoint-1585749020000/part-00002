The novel follows the character development of [[Elizabeth Bennet]], the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the [[Regency era]] in Great Britain.\n\nMr Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is [[Fee Tail|entailed]] and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family will be destitute upon his death. Thus it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not for money or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a wealthy match.\n\n''Pride and Prejudice'' has consistently appeared near the top of lists of \"most-loved books\" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1475660.php/Pride_and_Prejudice_%E2%80%93_Blu-ray_Review|title=Monstersandcritics.com|date=7 May 2009|publisher=Monstersandcritics.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026154330/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1475660.php/Pride_and_Prejudice_%E2%80%93_Blu-ray_Review|archive-date=26 October 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=27 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/austen-power-200-years-of-pride-and-prejudice-8454448.html|title=Austen power: 200 years of Pride and Prejudice|date=2013-01-19|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref> For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of ''Pride and Prejudice'' have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=76|isbn=978-1421422824}}</ref> The 2005 film ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' is the most recent film adaptation that closely represents the book.<ref>{{Citation|title=Pride and Prejudice and Zombies|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374989/|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is set in rural England in the early 19th century. Mrs Bennet attempts to persuade Mr Bennet to visit Mr Bingley, a rich bachelor recently arrived in the neighbourhood. After some verbal sparring with her husband, Mrs Bennet believes he will not call on Mr Bingley. Shortly after, he visits Netherfield, Mr Bingley's rented residence, much to Mrs Bennet's delight. The visit is followed by an invitation to a ball at the local [[assembly rooms]] that the entire neighbourhood will attend.\n\nAt the ball, Mr Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner makes him popular with guests. He appears attracted to Jane Bennet (the Bennets' eldest daughter), with whom he dances twice. Bingley's friend, [[Mr Darcy]], reputed to be twice as wealthy, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth (the Bennets' second eldest daughter), stating she is not attractive enough to tempt him.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pride and Prejudice|last=Austen|first=Jane|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Limited|year=1993|isbn=9781853260001|location=Hertfordshire|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Elizabeth finds this amusing and jokes about it with her sisters. \n\nMr Bingley's sister, Caroline, later invites Jane to Netherfield for dinner. On her way there, Jane is caught in a rain shower and develops a bad cold, forcing her to stay at Netherfield to recuperate. When Elizabeth goes to see Jane, Mr Darcy finds himself becoming attracted to Elizabeth, while Miss Bingley grows jealous, as she herself has designs on Mr Darcy.\n\n[[File:Houghton Typ 805.94.8320 - Pride and Prejudice, 1894, Hugh Thomson - Protested.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Illustration by [[Hugh Thomson]] representing Mr Collins, protesting that he never reads novels]]\nMr Collins, Mr Bennet's cousin and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family. He is a pompous, obsequious clergyman who intends to marry one of the Bennet girls. After learning that Jane may soon be engaged, he quickly decides on Elizabeth, the next daughter in both age and beauty.\n\nElizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming army officer, George Wickham, who singles out Elizabeth. He says he is connected to the Darcy family and claims Mr Darcy deprived him of an occupation (a permanent position as a clergyman in a prosperous parish with good revenue) promised to him by Mr Darcy's late father. Elizabeth's dislike of Mr Darcy is confirmed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the ball at Netherfield, Mr Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, and, despite her vow never to dance with him, she accepts. Excluding Jane and Elizabeth, several Bennet family members display a distinct lack of decorum. Mrs Bennet hints loudly that she fully expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged, and the younger Bennet sisters expose the family to ridicule by their silliness.\n\nMr Collins proposes to Elizabeth. She rejects him, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Shortly after, the Bingleys suddenly depart for London with no plans to return. After Elizabeth's rejection, Mr Collins proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible young woman and Elizabeth's friend. Charlotte, older (27), is grateful for a proposal that guarantees her a comfortable home. Elizabeth is aghast at such pragmatism in matters of love. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London. It soon is clear that Miss Bingley has no intention of resuming their acquaintance leaving Jane upset, though composed.\n\nIn the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, the imposing home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, imperious patroness of Mr Collins and Mr Darcy's wealthy aunt. Lady Catherine expects Mr Darcy to marry her daughter, as planned in his childhood by his aunt and mother. Mr Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises the prevented engagement was to Jane and is horrified that Mr Darcy interfered. Later, Mr Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her inferior social rank. She rejects him angrily, stating she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane, and suggests that he had been kinder to Bingley than to himself. He dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham sarcastically, but does not address it. \n\nLater, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the living his father arranged for him, and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and when impoverished, asked for the living again. After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable [[dowry]]. Mr Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because due to Jane's reserved behaviour, he sincerely believed her indifferent to Bingley, and also because of the lack of propriety of the other members of her family.\n[[File:Pickering - Greatbatch - Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice - She then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.jpg|thumb|200px|\nElizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia and Wickham, one of the two earliest illustrations of ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref>[[Janet M.

They visit Pemberley, the Darcy estate (after Elizabeth ascertains Mr Darcy's absence). The housekeeper there describes Mr Darcy as kind and generous, recounting several examples of these characteristics. When Mr Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious and later invites Elizabeth and the Gardiners to meet his sister, and Mr Gardiner to go fishing. Elizabeth is surprised and delighted by their treatment. She then receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr Darcy immediately, then departs in haste, believing she will never see him again as Lydia has ruined the family's good name.\n\nAfter an agonising interim, Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia. With some veneer of decency restored, Lydia visits the family and tells Elizabeth that Mr Darcy was at her and Wickham's wedding. Though Mr Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself. She hints that he may have had \"another motive\" for having done so, implying that she believes Darcy to be in love with Elizabeth.\n\nMr Bingley and Mr Darcy return to Netherfield. Bingley proposes to Jane, who accepts. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands she promise never to accept Mr Darcy's proposal. Elizabeth refuses and the outraged Lady Catherine leaves. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted. Elizabeth has difficulty in convincing her father that she is marrying for love, not position and wealth, but Mr Bennet is finally convinced. The novel concludes with an overview of the marriages of the three daughters and the great satisfaction of both parents at the fine, happy matches made by Jane and Elizabeth.\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Scenes from Pride and Prejudice.png|thumb|Scenes from \"Pride and Prejudice\", by [[C.

His estate, Longbourn, is [[Fee tail|entailed]] to the male line.\n* '''[[Bennet family#Mrs. Bennet|Mrs Bennet]] ([[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]] Gardiner)'''&nbsp;\u2013 the middle-aged wife of her social superior, Mr Bennet, and the mother of their five daughters.  Mrs Bennet is  a [[hypochondriac]] who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations (her \"poor nerves\"), whenever things are not going her way. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her.\n\n[[File:William Blake Mrs Q 1820 engraving after Francois Huet Villiers The British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|In a letter to Cassandra dated May 1813, Jane Austen describes a picture she saw at a gallery which was a good likeness of \"Mrs Bingley\" \u2013 Jane Bennet. Deirdre Le Faye in ''The World of Her Novels'' suggests that \"Portrait of Mrs Q-\" is the picture Austen was referring to. (pp. 201\u2013203)]]\n*  '''[[Bennet family#Jane Bennet|Jane Bennet]]''' \u2013 the eldest Bennet sister. Twenty-two years old when the novel begins, she is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is [[Optimism|inclined to see only the good in others]] (but can be persuaded otherwise on sufficient evidence). She falls in love with Charles Bingley, a rich young gentleman recently moved to Hertfordshire and a close friend of Mr Darcy.\n* '''[[Bennet family#Mary Bennet|Mary Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the middle Bennet sister, and the plainest of her siblings. Mary has a serious disposition and mostly reads and plays music, although she is often impatient to display her accomplishments and is rather vain about them. She frequently moralises to her family. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', Mary ended up marrying one of her Uncle Philips' law clerks and moving into Meryton with him.\n* '''[[Bennet family#Catherine Bennet|Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the fourth Bennet daughter at 17 years old. Though older than Lydia, she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit of the officers of the militia. She is often portrayed as envious of Lydia and is described a \"silly\" young woman. However, it is said that she improved when removed from Lydia's influence. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's ''A Memoir of Jane Austen'', Kitty later married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.\n* '''[[Lydia Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the youngest Bennet sister, aged 15 when the novel begins. She is frivolous and headstrong. Her main activity in life is socializing, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. This leads to her running off with George Wickham, although he has no intention of marrying her. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society; as Ashley Tauchert says, she \"feels without reasoning.\"<ref name=\"Ashley Tauchert\">{{cite journal |last=Tauchert |first=Ashley |title=Mary Wollstonecraft and Jane Austen: 'Rape' and 'Love' as (Feminist) Social Realism and Romance|journal=Women |date=2003 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=144 |doi=10.1080/09574040310107}}</ref>\n* '''Charles Bingley'''&nbsp;\u2013 a handsome, amiable, wealthy young gentleman from the north of England (possibly [[Yorkshire]], as [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] is mentioned, and there is, in fact, a real-life town called [[Bingley]] in [[West Yorkshire]]), who leases Netherfield Park, an estate three miles from Longbourn, with the hopes of purchasing it. He is contrasted with Mr Darcy for having more generally pleasing manners, although he is reliant on his more experienced friend for advice. An example of this is the prevention of Bingley and Jane's romance because of Bingley's undeniable dependence on Darcy's opinion.<ref>No love for Lydia: The fate of desire in Pride and Prejudice Allen DW 1985.</ref> He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others; his two sisters, Miss Caroline Bingley and Mrs Louisa Hurst, both disapprove of Bingley's growing affection for Miss Jane Bennet.\n* '''Caroline Bingley'''&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Vainglory|vainglorious]], snobbish sister of Charles Bingley, with a fortune of \u00a320,000 (giving her an allowance/pin money of \u00a31,000 per annum). Miss Bingley harbours designs upon Mr Darcy, and therefore is jealous of his growing attachment to Elizabeth. She attempts to dissuade Mr Darcy from liking Elizabeth by ridiculing the Bennet family and criticising Elizabeth's comportment. Miss Bingley also disapproves of her brother's esteem for Jane Bennet, and is disdainful of society in Meryton.  Her wealth (which she overspends) and her expensive education seem to be the two greatest sources of Miss Bingley's [[vanity]] and [[conceit]]; likewise, she is very insecure about the fact that her and her family's money all comes from trade, and is eager both for her brother to purchase an estate, ascending the Bingleys to the ranks of the Gentry, and for herself to marry a landed gentleman (i.e. Mr Darcy).  The dynamic between Miss Bingley and her sister, Louisa Hurst, seems to echo that of Lydia & Kitty Bennet's, and Mrs. Bennet's & Mrs. Phillips; that one is no more than a follower of the other, with Caroline in the same position as Lydia & Mrs. Bennet, and Louisa in Kitty's & Mrs. Phillips (though, in Louisa's case, as she's already married, she's not under the same desperation as Caroline). Louisa is married to Mr Hurst, who has a house in [[Grosvenor Square]], London.\n* '''[[George Wickham]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 Wickham has been acquainted with Mr Darcy since infancy, being the son of Mr Darcy's father's steward. An officer in the militia, he is [[superficially charming]] and rapidly forms an attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He later runs off with Lydia with no intention of marriage, which would have resulted in her and her family's complete disgrace, but for Darcy's intervention to bribe Wickham to marry her by paying off his immediate debts.\n* '''[[Mr William Collins]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 Mr Collins, aged 25 years old as the novel begins, is Mr Bennet's distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man who is excessively devoted to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n* '''[[Lady Catherine de Bourgh (character)|Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the overbearing aunt of Mr Darcy. Lady Catherine is the wealthy owner of Rosings Park, where she resides with her daughter Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr Collins. She is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending, and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy, to 'unite their two great estates', claiming it to be the dearest wish of both her and her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (n\u00e9e Fitzwilliam).\n* '''Mr Edward and Mrs M Gardiner'''&nbsp;\u2013 Edward Gardiner is Mrs Bennet's brother and a successful tradesman of sensible and gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is genteel and elegant, and is close to her nieces Jane and Elizabeth. The Gardiners are instrumental in bringing about the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth.\n*'''Georgiana Darcy'''&nbsp;\u2013 Georgiana is Mr Darcy's quiet, amiable (and shy) younger sister, with a [[dowry]] of \u00a330,000 (giving her an allowance/pin money of \u00a31,500 per annum), and is aged barely 16 when the story begins. When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr Wickham, but was saved by her brother, whom she idolises. Thanks to years of tutorage under masters, she is accomplished at the piano, singing, playing the harp, and drawing, and modern languages, and is therefore described as Caroline Bingley's idea of an \"accomplished woman\".\n* '''Charlotte Lucas'''&nbsp;\u2013 Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 years old (and thus very much beyond what was then considered prime marriageable age), fears becoming a burden to her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr Collins to gain financial security. Though the novel stresses the importance of love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love, but convenience.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, neighbours of the Bennet family.\n* '''Colonel Fitzwilliam'''&nbsp;\u2013 Colonel Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an earl, and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy; this makes him the cousin of Anne de Bourgh and the Darcy siblings, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. He is about 30 years old at the beginning of the novel. He is the co-guardian of Miss Georgiana Darcy, along with his cousin, Mr Darcy.  According to Colonel Fitzwilliam, as a younger son, he cannot marry without thought to his prospective bride's [[dowry]]; Elizabeth Bennet joked that, as the son of an Earl, Colonel Fitzwilliam wouldn't be able to settle for a bride with a dowry lower than \u00a350,000 (which suggests that Colonel Fitzwilliam's living allowance is about \u00a32,500 per-year).\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[File:Pride and Prejudice Character Map.png|left|720px|thumb|A comprehensive web showing the relationships between the main characters in ''Pride and Prejudice'']]</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Major themes==\nMany critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of ''Pride and Prejudice'' but, Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title, because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. \"After the success of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.

Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated by the \"neighbourhood\" families and their daughters who require a \"good fortune\".\n\nMarriage is a complex social activity that takes political economy and economy generally, into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr and Mrs Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological). The Bennets' marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous. Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically-equivalent social status as gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a better understanding of each other's point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.\n\nWhen Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying for love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gao |first=Haiyan |date=February 2013 |title=Jane Austen's Ideal Man in Pride and Prejudice |journal=Theory and Practice in Language Studies |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=384\u2013388 |doi=10.4304/tpls.3.2.384-388 }}</ref> Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, companionate attraction.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Wealth===\nMoney plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman of means. George Wickham tried to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam married for money. Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a high family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr Bingley arrives, she declares \"I am thinking of his marrying one of them\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Austen|first1=Jane|title=Pride and Prejudice|date=1813|page=3}}</ref>\n\nInheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by [[Fee tail|entailment]], which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security but she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century and women's financial security depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have.<ref name=Chung>{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=Ching-Yi|title=Gender and class oppression in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice|journal=IRWLE|date=July 2013|volume=9|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/2612757}}</ref> The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Class===\n[[File:LadyCatherine & Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Catherine and Elizabeth by [[C.

This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel.]]\nAusten might be known now for her \"romances\" but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction. ''Pride and Prejudice'' is hardly the exception. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, \"Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?\" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are \"equals\"), Lady Catherine refuses to accept Darcy's actual marriage to Elizabeth even as the novel closes.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nThe Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes a point to explain that the Bingleys are trade rather than inheritors and rentiers. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall&nbsp;\u2013 it is, after all, \"to let\"&nbsp;\u2013 distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family and through his mother, is the grandson and nephew of an [[Earl]]. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property, but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, ambitious cits (merchant class), etc. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.<ref>Michie, Elsie B. \"Social Distinction in Jane Austen, ''Pride and Prejudice'', 1813, edited by Donald Gray and Mary A.

Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:\n\n{{quote|\"How despicably have I acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.

Tanner writes that Mrs Bennet in particular, \"has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Knowledge and Opinion: Pride and Prejudice |last=Tanner |first=Tony |publisher=Macmillan Education Ltd.|year=1986 |isbn=978-0333323175 |page=124 }}</ref> Mrs Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married. \"The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Pride and Prejudice |last=Austen |first=Jane |publisher=W.W.

Academic Search Complete. Web. 16 February 2016.</ref> By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. \"The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential&nbsp;... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.\"<ref name=\"miles\" /> The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham's true character. Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the \"oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.\".<ref name=\"Ashley Tauchert\" /> Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals Free Indirect Discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, Free Indirect Discourse is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1= Angus|last2 =Benveniste|first2= Mike|date=Winter 2013|title=A Scientific Justification for Literature: Jane Austen's Free Indirect Style as Ethical Tool|journal=Journal of Narrative Theory|volume=43|number =1|page=13|doi = 10.1353/jnt.2013.0011 }}</ref>\n\n==Development of the novel==\n[[File:Letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, 1799 June 11.

The novel follows the character development of [[Elizabeth Bennet]], the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the [[Regency era]] in Great Britain.\n\nMr Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is [[Fee Tail|entailed]] and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family will be destitute upon his death. Thus it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not for money or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a wealthy match.\n\n''Pride and Prejudice'' has consistently appeared near the top of lists of \"most-loved books\" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1475660.php/Pride_and_Prejudice_%E2%80%93_Blu-ray_Review|title=Monstersandcritics.com|date=7 May 2009|publisher=Monstersandcritics.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026154330/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1475660.php/Pride_and_Prejudice_%E2%80%93_Blu-ray_Review|archive-date=26 October 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=27 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/austen-power-200-years-of-pride-and-prejudice-8454448.html|title=Austen power: 200 years of Pride and Prejudice|date=2013-01-19|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref> For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of ''Pride and Prejudice'' have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=76|isbn=978-1421422824}}</ref> The 2005 film ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' is the most recent film adaptation that closely represents the book.<ref>{{Citation|title=Pride and Prejudice and Zombies|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374989/|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is set in rural England in the early 19th century. Mrs Bennet attempts to persuade Mr Bennet to visit Mr Bingley, a rich bachelor recently arrived in the neighbourhood. After some verbal sparring with her husband, Mrs Bennet believes he will not call on Mr Bingley. Shortly after, he visits Netherfield, Mr Bingley's rented residence, much to Mrs Bennet's delight. The visit is followed by an invitation to a ball at the local [[assembly rooms]] that the entire neighbourhood will attend.\n\nAt the ball, Mr Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner makes him popular with guests. He appears attracted to Jane Bennet (the Bennets' eldest daughter), with whom he dances twice. Bingley's friend, [[Mr Darcy]], reputed to be twice as wealthy, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth (the Bennets' second eldest daughter), stating she is not attractive enough to tempt him.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pride and Prejudice|last=Austen|first=Jane|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Limited|year=1993|isbn=9781853260001|location=Hertfordshire|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Elizabeth finds this amusing and jokes about it with her sisters. \n\nMr Bingley's sister, Caroline, later invites Jane to Netherfield for dinner. On her way there, Jane is caught in a rain shower and develops a bad cold, forcing her to stay at Netherfield to recuperate. When Elizabeth goes to see Jane, Mr Darcy finds himself becoming attracted to Elizabeth, while Miss Bingley grows jealous, as she herself has designs on Mr Darcy.\n\n[[File:Houghton Typ 805.94.8320 - Pride and Prejudice, 1894, Hugh Thomson - Protested.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Illustration by [[Hugh Thomson]] representing Mr Collins, protesting that he never reads novels]]\nMr Collins, Mr Bennet's cousin and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family. He is a pompous, obsequious clergyman who intends to marry one of the Bennet girls. After learning that Jane may soon be engaged, he quickly decides on Elizabeth, the next daughter in both age and beauty.\n\nElizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming army officer, George Wickham, who singles out Elizabeth. He says he is connected to the Darcy family and claims Mr Darcy deprived him of an occupation (a permanent position as a clergyman in a prosperous parish with good revenue) promised to him by Mr Darcy's late father. Elizabeth's dislike of Mr Darcy is confirmed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the ball at Netherfield, Mr Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, and, despite her vow never to dance with him, she accepts. Excluding Jane and Elizabeth, several Bennet family members display a distinct lack of decorum. Mrs Bennet hints loudly that she fully expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged, and the younger Bennet sisters expose the family to ridicule by their silliness.\n\nMr Collins proposes to Elizabeth. She rejects him, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Shortly after, the Bingleys suddenly depart for London with no plans to return. After Elizabeth's rejection, Mr Collins proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible young woman and Elizabeth's friend. Charlotte, older (27), is grateful for a proposal that guarantees her a comfortable home. Elizabeth is aghast at such pragmatism in matters of love. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London. It soon is clear that Miss Bingley has no intention of resuming their acquaintance leaving Jane upset, though composed.\n\nIn the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, the imposing home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, imperious patroness of Mr Collins and Mr Darcy's wealthy aunt. Lady Catherine expects Mr Darcy to marry her daughter, as planned in his childhood by his aunt and mother. Mr Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises the prevented engagement was to Jane and is horrified that Mr Darcy interfered. Later, Mr Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her inferior social rank. She rejects him angrily, stating she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane, and suggests that he had been kinder to Bingley than to himself. He dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham sarcastically, but does not address it. \n\nLater, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the living his father arranged for him, and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and when impoverished, asked for the living again. After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable [[dowry]]. Mr Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because due to Jane's reserved behaviour, he sincerely believed her indifferent to Bingley, and also because of the lack of propriety of the other members of her family.\n[[File:Pickering - Greatbatch - Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice - She then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.jpg|thumb|200px|\nElizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia and Wickham, one of the two earliest illustrations of ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref>[[Janet M.

They visit Pemberley, the Darcy estate (after Elizabeth ascertains Mr Darcy's absence). The housekeeper there describes Mr Darcy as kind and generous, recounting several examples of these characteristics. When Mr Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious and later invites Elizabeth and the Gardiners to meet his sister, and Mr Gardiner to go fishing. Elizabeth is surprised and delighted by their treatment. She then receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr Darcy immediately, then departs in haste, believing she will never see him again as Lydia has ruined the family's good name.\n\nAfter an agonising interim, Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia. With some veneer of decency restored, Lydia visits the family and tells Elizabeth that Mr Darcy was at her and Wickham's wedding. Though Mr Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself. She hints that he may have had \"another motive\" for having done so, implying that she believes Darcy to be in love with Elizabeth.\n\nMr Bingley and Mr Darcy return to Netherfield. Bingley proposes to Jane, who accepts. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands she promise never to accept Mr Darcy's proposal. Elizabeth refuses and the outraged Lady Catherine leaves. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted. Elizabeth has difficulty in convincing her father that she is marrying for love, not position and wealth, but Mr Bennet is finally convinced.

As the story progresses, so does her relationship with Mr Darcy. The course of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading them both to surrender to their love for each other.\n* '''[[Mr. Darcy|Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy]]'''&nbsp;\u2013  Mr Bingley's friend and the wealthy, twenty-eight-year-old owner of the family estate of [[Pemberley]] in [[Derbyshire]], rumoured to be worth at least \u00a310,000 a year (equivalent to \u00a3796,000 or $1,045,000 in 2018).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/11063670/Could-Mr-Darcy-afford-a-stately-home-today.html|title=Could Mr Darcy afford a stately home today?|date=June 20, 2018|website=The Telegraph|access-date=June 20, 2018|last1=Runcie|first1=Charlotte}}</ref> While he is handsome, tall, and intelligent, Darcy lacks ease and [[social graces]], and so others frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve and rectitude as proof of excessive pride (which, in part, it is). A new visitor to the village, he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet's love interest.\n* '''[[Mr Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 A late-middle-aged [[Landed gentry|landed]] [[gentry|gentleman]] of a modest income of \u00a32000 per annum, and the dryly sarcastic [[patriarch]] of the now-dwindling [[Bennet family]] (a family of [[Hertfordshire]] landed gentry), with five unmarried daughters. His estate, Longbourn, is [[Fee tail|entailed]] to the male line.\n* '''[[Bennet family#Mrs. Bennet|Mrs Bennet]] ([[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]] Gardiner)'''&nbsp;\u2013 the middle-aged wife of her social superior, Mr Bennet, and the mother of their five daughters.  Mrs Bennet is  a [[hypochondriac]] who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations (her \"poor nerves\"), whenever things are not going her way. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her.\n\n[[File:William Blake Mrs Q 1820 engraving after Francois Huet Villiers The British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|In a letter to Cassandra dated May 1813, Jane Austen describes a picture she saw at a gallery which was a good likeness of \"Mrs Bingley\" \u2013 Jane Bennet.

(pp. 201\u2013203)]]\n*  '''[[Bennet family#Jane Bennet|Jane Bennet]]''' \u2013 the eldest Bennet sister. Twenty-two years old when the novel begins, she is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is [[Optimism|inclined to see only the good in others]] (but can be persuaded otherwise on sufficient evidence). She falls in love with Charles Bingley, a rich young gentleman recently moved to Hertfordshire and a close friend of Mr Darcy.\n* '''[[Bennet family#Mary Bennet|Mary Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the middle Bennet sister, and the plainest of her siblings. Mary has a serious disposition and mostly reads and plays music, although she is often impatient to display her accomplishments and is rather vain about them. She frequently moralises to her family. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', Mary ended up marrying one of her Uncle Philips' law clerks and moving into Meryton with him.\n* '''[[Bennet family#Catherine Bennet|Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the fourth Bennet daughter at 17 years old. Though older than Lydia, she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit of the officers of the militia. She is often portrayed as envious of Lydia and is described a \"silly\" young woman. However, it is said that she improved when removed from Lydia's influence. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's ''A Memoir of Jane Austen'', Kitty later married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.\n* '''[[Lydia Bennet]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the youngest Bennet sister, aged 15 when the novel begins. She is frivolous and headstrong. Her main activity in life is socializing, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. This leads to her running off with George Wickham, although he has no intention of marrying her. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society; as Ashley Tauchert says, she \"feels without reasoning.\"<ref name=\"Ashley Tauchert\">{{cite journal |last=Tauchert |first=Ashley |title=Mary Wollstonecraft and Jane Austen: 'Rape' and 'Love' as (Feminist) Social Realism and Romance|journal=Women |date=2003 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=144 |doi=10.1080/09574040310107}}</ref>\n* '''Charles Bingley'''&nbsp;\u2013 a handsome, amiable, wealthy young gentleman from the north of England (possibly [[Yorkshire]], as [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] is mentioned, and there is, in fact, a real-life town called [[Bingley]] in [[West Yorkshire]]), who leases Netherfield Park, an estate three miles from Longbourn, with the hopes of purchasing it. He is contrasted with Mr Darcy for having more generally pleasing manners, although he is reliant on his more experienced friend for advice. An example of this is the prevention of Bingley and Jane's romance because of Bingley's undeniable dependence on Darcy's opinion.<ref>No love for Lydia: The fate of desire in Pride and Prejudice Allen DW 1985.</ref> He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others; his two sisters, Miss Caroline Bingley and Mrs Louisa Hurst, both disapprove of Bingley's growing affection for Miss Jane Bennet.\n* '''Caroline Bingley'''&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Vainglory|vainglorious]], snobbish sister of Charles Bingley, with a fortune of \u00a320,000 (giving her an allowance/pin money of \u00a31,000 per annum). Miss Bingley harbours designs upon Mr Darcy, and therefore is jealous of his growing attachment to Elizabeth. She attempts to dissuade Mr Darcy from liking Elizabeth by ridiculing the Bennet family and criticising Elizabeth's comportment. Miss Bingley also disapproves of her brother's esteem for Jane Bennet, and is disdainful of society in Meryton.  Her wealth (which she overspends) and her expensive education seem to be the two greatest sources of Miss Bingley's [[vanity]] and [[conceit]]; likewise, she is very insecure about the fact that her and her family's money all comes from trade, and is eager both for her brother to purchase an estate, ascending the Bingleys to the ranks of the Gentry, and for herself to marry a landed gentleman (i.e. Mr Darcy).  The dynamic between Miss Bingley and her sister, Louisa Hurst, seems to echo that of Lydia & Kitty Bennet's, and Mrs. Bennet's & Mrs. Phillips; that one is no more than a follower of the other, with Caroline in the same position as Lydia & Mrs. Bennet, and Louisa in Kitty's & Mrs. Phillips (though, in Louisa's case, as she's already married, she's not under the same desperation as Caroline). Louisa is married to Mr Hurst, who has a house in [[Grosvenor Square]], London.\n* '''[[George Wickham]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 Wickham has been acquainted with Mr Darcy since infancy, being the son of Mr Darcy's father's steward. An officer in the militia, he is [[superficially charming]] and rapidly forms an attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He later runs off with Lydia with no intention of marriage, which would have resulted in her and her family's complete disgrace, but for Darcy's intervention to bribe Wickham to marry her by paying off his immediate debts.\n* '''[[Mr William Collins]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 Mr Collins, aged 25 years old as the novel begins, is Mr Bennet's distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man who is excessively devoted to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n* '''[[Lady Catherine de Bourgh (character)|Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 the overbearing aunt of Mr Darcy. Lady Catherine is the wealthy owner of Rosings Park, where she resides with her daughter Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr Collins. She is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending, and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy, to 'unite their two great estates', claiming it to be the dearest wish of both her and her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (n\u00e9e Fitzwilliam).\n* '''Mr Edward and Mrs M Gardiner'''&nbsp;\u2013 Edward Gardiner is Mrs Bennet's brother and a successful tradesman of sensible and gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is genteel and elegant, and is close to her nieces Jane and Elizabeth. The Gardiners are instrumental in bringing about the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth.\n*'''Georgiana Darcy'''&nbsp;\u2013 Georgiana is Mr Darcy's quiet, amiable (and shy) younger sister, with a [[dowry]] of \u00a330,000 (giving her an allowance/pin money of \u00a31,500 per annum), and is aged barely 16 when the story begins. When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr Wickham, but was saved by her brother, whom she idolises. Thanks to years of tutorage under masters, she is accomplished at the piano, singing, playing the harp, and drawing, and modern languages, and is therefore described as Caroline Bingley's idea of an \"accomplished woman\".\n* '''Charlotte Lucas'''&nbsp;\u2013 Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 years old (and thus very much beyond what was then considered prime marriageable age), fears becoming a burden to her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr Collins to gain financial security. Though the novel stresses the importance of love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love, but convenience.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, neighbours of the Bennet family.\n* '''Colonel Fitzwilliam'''&nbsp;\u2013 Colonel Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an earl, and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy; this makes him the cousin of Anne de Bourgh and the Darcy siblings, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. He is about 30 years old at the beginning of the novel. He is the co-guardian of Miss Georgiana Darcy, along with his cousin, Mr Darcy.  According to Colonel Fitzwilliam, as a younger son, he cannot marry without thought to his prospective bride's [[dowry]]; Elizabeth Bennet joked that, as the son of an Earl, Colonel Fitzwilliam wouldn't be able to settle for a bride with a dowry lower than \u00a350,000 (which suggests that Colonel Fitzwilliam's living allowance is about \u00a32,500 per-year).\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[File:Pride and Prejudice Character Map.png|left|720px|thumb|A comprehensive web showing the relationships between the main characters in ''Pride and Prejudice'']]</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Major themes==\nMany critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of ''Pride and Prejudice'' but, Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title, because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. \"After the success of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.

Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated by the \"neighbourhood\" families and their daughters who require a \"good fortune\".\n\nMarriage is a complex social activity that takes political economy and economy generally, into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr and Mrs Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological). The Bennets' marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous. Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically-equivalent social status as gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a better understanding of each other's point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.\n\nWhen Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying for love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gao |first=Haiyan |date=February 2013 |title=Jane Austen's Ideal Man in Pride and Prejudice |journal=Theory and Practice in Language Studies |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=384\u2013388 |doi=10.4304/tpls.3.2.384-388 }}</ref> Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, companionate attraction.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Wealth===\nMoney plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman of means. George Wickham tried to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam married for money. Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a high family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr Bingley arrives, she declares \"I am thinking of his marrying one of them\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Austen|first1=Jane|title=Pride and Prejudice|date=1813|page=3}}</ref>\n\nInheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by [[Fee tail|entailment]], which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security but she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century and women's financial security depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have.<ref name=Chung>{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=Ching-Yi|title=Gender and class oppression in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice|journal=IRWLE|date=July 2013|volume=9|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/2612757}}</ref> The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Class===\n[[File:LadyCatherine & Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Catherine and Elizabeth by [[C.

This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel.]]\nAusten might be known now for her \"romances\" but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction. ''Pride and Prejudice'' is hardly the exception. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, \"Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?\" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are \"equals\"), Lady Catherine refuses to accept Darcy's actual marriage to Elizabeth even as the novel closes.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nThe Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes a point to explain that the Bingleys are trade rather than inheritors and rentiers. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall&nbsp;\u2013 it is, after all, \"to let\"&nbsp;\u2013 distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family and through his mother, is the grandson and nephew of an [[Earl]]. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property, but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, ambitious cits (merchant class), etc. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.<ref>Michie, Elsie B. \"Social Distinction in Jane Austen, ''Pride and Prejudice'', 1813, edited by Donald Gray and Mary A.

Tanner writes that Mrs Bennet in particular, \"has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Knowledge and Opinion: Pride and Prejudice |last=Tanner |first=Tony |publisher=Macmillan Education Ltd.|year=1986 |isbn=978-0333323175 |page=124 }}</ref> Mrs Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married. \"The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Pride and Prejudice |last=Austen |first=Jane |publisher=W.W.

Academic Search Complete. Web. 16 February 2016.</ref> By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. \"The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential&nbsp;... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.\"<ref name=\"miles\" /> The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham's true character. Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the \"oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.\".<ref name=\"Ashley Tauchert\" /> Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals Free Indirect Discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds.

From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed that ''First Impressions'' was an [[epistolary novel]].<ref>This theory is defended in \"Character and Caricature in Jane Austen\" by DW Harding in ''Critical Essays on Jane Austen'' (BC Southam Edition, London 1968) and Brian Southam in {{cite book|last1=Southam|first1=B.C.|title=Jane Austen's literary manuscripts : a study of the novelist's development through the surviving papers|date=2001|publisher=the Athlone press / Continuum |location=London |isbn=9780826490704 |pages=58\u201359|edition= New}}</ref> She later renamed the story ''Pride and Prejudice'' around about 1811/1812, which she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to [[Thomas Egerton (publisher)|Thomas Egerton]] for \u00a3110<ref>{{cite book|last =Irvine|first= Robert|title=Jane Austen|location=London|publisher = Routledge|isbn = 978-0-415-31435-0 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n0LmV_Rcb3QC&pg=PA56|date= 2005| page= 56}}</ref> ({{Inflation|UK|110|1812|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).
