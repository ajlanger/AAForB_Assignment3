He had first caught the eye of Barons' manager [[Piper Davis]] in tenth grade, when Davis had Mays try out for the team.

Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout.<ref>Hirsch, p. 38-48</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but they were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz</ref>\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAccording to Mays, Eddie Montague had been sent to Birmingham to scout [[Alonzo Perry]] as a potential first baseman for the [[Sioux City Soos]] of the Class-A [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], but Montague became interested in Mays instead after watching a doubleheader.<ref>Mays, pp. 44-45</ref> Due to a scandal in Sioux City concerning a Native American's burial in a whites-only cemetery at the time, Sioux City decided not to take Mays, and he was assigned to the [[Trenton Giants]] of the [[Interstate League]] instead.<ref>Mays, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nAfter Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  \"WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL.\"<ref>''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988).

Later that year, he was also elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. Mays is one of five National League players to have had eight consecutive 100-RBI seasons, along with [[Mel Ott]], [[Sammy Sosa]], [[Chipper Jones]], and [[Albert Pujols]]. Mays hit over 50 home runs in 1955 and 1965, representing the longest time span between 50-plus home run seasons for any player in [[Major League Baseball]] history.

He had first caught the eye of Barons' manager [[Piper Davis]] in tenth grade, when Davis had Mays try out for the team. Davis encouraged Mays to work on hitting the [[curveball]], coached him periodically for a couple years, and gave Mays a chance to play for the Barons starting in 1947, when Mays was just 16.<ref>Mays, pp. 24, 26, 30</ref> When E. T. Oliver, principal at Mays's high school, threatened to suspend Mays for playing professional ball, Davis and Mays's father convinced him that Mays would still be able to concentrate on his studies.<ref>Mays, p. 32</ref> Mays helped Birmingham win the pennant and advance to the 1948 [[Negro League World Series]], which they lost 4-1 to the [[Homestead Grays]]. Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout.<ref>Hirsch, p. 38-48</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but they were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz</ref>\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAccording to Mays, Eddie Montague had been sent to Birmingham to scout [[Alonzo Perry]] as a potential first baseman for the [[Sioux City Soos]] of the Class-A [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], but Montague became interested in Mays instead after watching a doubleheader.<ref>Mays, pp. 44-45</ref> Due to a scandal in Sioux City concerning a Native American's burial in a whites-only cemetery at the time, Sioux City decided not to take Mays, and he was assigned to the [[Trenton Giants]] of the [[Interstate League]] instead.<ref>Mays, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nAfter Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  \"WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL.\"<ref>''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988). New York: Doubleday. page 358. {{ISBN|0-385 23790-1}}</ref>{{efn|Mays's autobiography has the account slightly differently. He remembered the houselights coming on in the middle of a movie and someone mounting the stage to announce, \"If Willie Mays is in the audience, would he please report immediately to his manager at the hotel.\"<ref>Mays, p. 60</ref>}} He appeared in his first major league game the next day in [[Philadelphia]]. Mays moved to [[Harlem, New York]], where his mentor was a [[New York State Boxing Commission]] official and former Harlem Rens basketball legend  \"Strangler\" [[Frank Forbes]].\n\n===Major leagues===\n\n====New York Giants (1951\u20131957)====\nMays began his major league career on a sour note, with no hits in his first 12 [[at bat]]s. On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run up and over the left field roof of the [[Polo Grounds]] off future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Warren Spahn]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016223.html ESPN.com: Mays brought joy to baseball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Spahn later joked, \"I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out.\"  Mays' batting average improved steadily throughout the rest of the season. Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]]. During the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants']] comeback in August and September 1951 to tie the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] in the pennant race, Mays' fielding and strong throwing arm were instrumental to several important Giants victories.<ref>''Willie Mays'', by Matt von Albade, Tempo Books, Grosset & Dunlop, Inc.

The 1954 World Series was the team's last championship while based in New York.

In the middle of May, 1955, Durocher asked him to try for more home runs.<ref>Mays, pp. 128-29</ref> Mays led the league with 51. In 1956, he hit 36 homers and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player, to join the \"[[30\u201330 club]]\". In 1957, the first season the [[Gold Glove]] award was presented, he won the first of 12 consecutive [[Gold Glove Award]]s. At the same time, Mays continued to finish in the National League's top-five in a variety of offensive categories. Mays, [[Roberto Clemente]] (also with 12), [[Al Kaline]], [[Andruw Jones]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]] are the only outfielders to have ten or more career Gold Gloves. In 1957, Mays became the fourth player in major league history to join the [[20\u201320\u201320 club]] (2B, 3B, HR), something no player had accomplished since 1941.
