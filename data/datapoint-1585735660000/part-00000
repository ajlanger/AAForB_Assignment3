The road, one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome, became soon one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]], and until the mid of 18th century was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility, which enlivened it with feasts and games. After a two-century eclipse, from the mid-twentieth century the road has been living a rebirth, and now it is again one of the city's most prestigious addresses.\n==Location==\nThe road stretches in south-southeast  north - northwest direction on the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]], between ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], and ''Piazza dell'Oro''. Along its length of about 1 km, it connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road has been named after his builder, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who let it built in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref>It has been also called ''Via Magistralis'' (\"Master road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and also ''Via recta'' (\"Straight road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of the shape of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient ''[[Campus Martius]]'' developed since the early [[Middle Ages]] into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by only three narrow thoroughfares: the ''Via Papalis'' (\"Papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the ''Via Peregrinorum'' (pilgrims' road) <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the ''Via Recta'' (\"Straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> Through these streets, towards the bottleneck of the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]], solemn [[procession]]s squeezed through almost daily since the [[Middle Ages]]. Already in the first [[Jubilee in the Catholic Church|Holy Year]] 1300, proclaimed by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303), the crowds on the bridge to the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] were so large that, as [[Dante Alighieri]] describes in the [[Divine Comedy]], a kind of two-way traffic system had to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Western_Schism#Resolution|the return]] of [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) to Rome in 1420, the masses of pilgrims increased enormously again, especially in the Jubilee years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge, in which more than 300 people died.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe of 1450, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the reconstruction of the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]], thus connecting the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons were also decisive for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nBesides the reconstruction of [[St. Peter's Basilica]],  Julius II implemented many projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae''), a task which had been begun forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484), in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]''.<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref>One of the most import among them was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia, a new representative street through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the quarter of the Florentine merchants on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara then, which in the intentions of the [[Pope]] was to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]], had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/>  and convey the goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]]  and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main idea behind these interventions was to superimpose a regular road network with centre of gravity given by the river on the disorderly set of buildings that was medieval Rome; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]], just opened in the Borgo by Alexander VI, and the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia, which according to the original project should have reached the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] too thanks to the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]'',<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> came to create a regular quadrangular structure in the maze of alleys of the city.<ref name=\"po19\"/> Thanks to these interventions, the center of the city would have moved in the direction of the Vatican and [[Trastevere]], to the detriment of the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], symbol of the power of the Roman nobility.<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> This plan was then intended to curb papal power from the dependence of the city's powerful noble families, above all the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]].<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\nBesides that, these projects had a celebrative goal, strengthening the fame of the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in fact in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope quickly overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families, conquering [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]].<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> An inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' <ref>''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

From the middle of the 16th century onwards, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (\"Beggar's Hospice\"), built in 1586 by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590), marked the end of the Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7976/> The building, which was conceived to solve the begging problem in the city, with a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' could give work to 2,000 men and women.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome, the so called ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred addresses for this purpose. The Florentines (with [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]]), the seneses with [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]] and Neapolitans (with [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]]), had their representative churches built in Via Giulia,<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the churches of the Bologneses (with [[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish (with [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English (with [[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedes (with [[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) lay nearby, being all in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extended over the Tiber and in 1613 a fountain, the Fontanone (\"Big fountain\") di Ponte Sisto, was built on the fa\u00e7ade of the beggars' hospice in the axis of Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> This fountain was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now Piazza Trilussa.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century the course of the Via Giulia was basically fixed.

The road, one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome, became soon one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]], and until the mid of 18th century was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility, which enlivened it with feasts and games. After a two-century eclipse, from the mid-twentieth century the road has been living a rebirth, and now it is again one of the city's most prestigious addresses.\n==Location==\nThe road stretches in south-southeast  north - northwest direction on the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]], between ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], and ''Piazza dell'Oro''. Along its length of about 1 km, it connects the [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]] [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road has been named after his builder, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who let it built in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref>It has been also called ''Via Magistralis'' (\"Master road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and also ''Via recta'' (\"Straight road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of the shape of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient ''[[Campus Martius]]'' developed since the early [[Middle Ages]] into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by only three narrow thoroughfares: the ''Via Papalis'' (\"Papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the ''Via Peregrinorum'' (pilgrims' road) <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the ''Via Recta'' (\"Straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> Through these streets, towards the bottleneck of the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]], solemn [[procession]]s squeezed through almost daily since the [[Middle Ages]]. Already in the first [[Jubilee in the Catholic Church|Holy Year]] 1300, proclaimed by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303), the crowds on the bridge to the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] were so large that, as [[Dante Alighieri]] describes in the [[Divine Comedy]], a kind of two-way traffic system had to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Western_Schism#Resolution|the return]] of [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) to Rome in 1420, the masses of pilgrims increased enormously again, especially in the Jubilee years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge, in which more than 300 people died.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe of 1450, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the reconstruction of the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]], thus connecting the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons were also decisive for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nBesides the reconstruction of [[St. Peter's Basilica]],  Julius II implemented many projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae''), a task which had been begun forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484), in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]''.<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref>One of the most import among them was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia, a new representative street through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the quarter of the Florentine merchants on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara then, which in the intentions of the [[Pope]] was to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]], had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/>  and convey the goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]]  and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main idea behind these interventions was to superimpose a regular road network with centre of gravity given by the river on the disorderly set of buildings that was medieval Rome; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]], just opened in the Borgo by Alexander VI, and the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia, which according to the original project should have reached the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] too thanks to the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]'',<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> came to create a regular quadrangular structure in the maze of alleys of the city.<ref name=\"po19\"/> Thanks to these interventions, the center of the city would have moved in the direction of the Vatican and [[Trastevere]], to the detriment of the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], symbol of the power of the Roman nobility.<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> This plan was then intended to curb papal power from the dependence of the city's powerful noble families, above all the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]].<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\nBesides that, these projects had a celebrative goal, strengthening the fame of the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in fact in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope quickly overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families, conquering [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]].<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> An inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' <ref>''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

From the middle of the 16th century onwards, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (\"Beggar's Hospice\"), built in 1586 by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590), marked the end of the Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7976/> The building, which was conceived to solve the begging problem in the city, with a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' could give work to 2,000 men and women.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome, the so called ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred addresses for this purpose. The Florentines (with [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]]), the seneses with [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]] and Neapolitans (with [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]]), had their representative churches built in Via Giulia,<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the churches of the Bologneses (with [[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish (with [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English (with [[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedes (with [[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) lay nearby, being all in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extended over the Tiber and in 1613 a fountain, the Fontanone (\"Big fountain\") di Ponte Sisto, was built on the fa\u00e7ade of the beggars' hospice in the axis of Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> This fountain was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now Piazza Trilussa.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century the course of the Via Giulia was basically fixed.
