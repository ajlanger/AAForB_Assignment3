Plot summaries for films on Wikipedia are recommended to be between 400-700 words. All edits in this section are logged and reviewed. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nIn [[New York Harbor]], filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], known for wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the ''Venture'', for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate [[Jack Driscoll|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann.\n\nDenham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They rebuff him and return to the ''Venture''.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the wall gate and to an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], an enormous [[gorilla]]-like creature. Kong carries a terrified Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to defeat. After facing a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and Kong himself, Jack and Denham are the only survivors.\n\nA ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Jack continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, shoves Jack aside, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grip. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and then climbs the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes sorrowfully at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fay Wray]] as Ann Darrow\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as [[Jack Driscoll|John \u201cJack\u201d Driscoll]]\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]] as Charles Weston\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as the Native Chief\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as the Witch King\n* [[James Flavin]] as Briggs, 2nd Mate\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie the Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as the Native in [[Ape]] Costume (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Kong (1933), Brontosaur.jpeg|thumb|An articulated skeleton of the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' used in the film.]]\nBefore ''King Kong'' entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films (for example ''[[Stark Mad]]'') generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth. In these films, scientific knowledge could be subverted at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had [[primate]] exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] had earlier [[monkey]] experience directing ''[[Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness]]'' (1927), also with [[Merian C. Cooper]], and ''[[Rango (1931 film)|Rango]]'' (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)], repr. ''Gerald Peary: Film Reviews, Interviews, Essays and Sundry Miscellany'', 2004.</ref> The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates it was one of the highest-grossing films of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed ''Ingagi'' among his influences for ''King Kong,'' it has long been held that RKO green-lit ''Kong'' because of the bottom-line example of ''Ingagi'' and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Erish | title=Illegitimate Dad of King Kong | date=January 8, 2006| newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading W. Douglas Burden's ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\"Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper called in [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\"Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \u201cmythic elements\u201d, believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\"Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\"Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled ''Kong'' for production.<ref>Morton, p. 28\u20139</ref> Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.<ref>Morton, p. 29</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been principally sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

She met ''Kong'' co-directors Cooper and Schoedsack when cast as Ethne Eustace in ''[[The Four Feathers (1929 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1929).

[[Dorothy Jordan (film actress)|Dorothy Jordan]], [[Jean Harlow]], and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, ''On the Other Hand'', Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the \"tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood\". She assumed he meant [[Clark Gable]] until he showed her a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.<ref name=\"Morton31-3\"/> On the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, one New York theater held a Fay Wray scream-alike contest in its lobby,<ref name=\"erb31\" /> and on August 10, 2004, two days after Wray died, the lights of the [[Empire State Building]] were dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory.<ref>United Press International</ref>\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]\n[[File:Robert Armstrong.JPG|right|thumb|Armstrong featured in [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for later film, ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936)]]\n:[[Michigan]] native and veteran [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[silent film]] character actor [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] played Wray's alcoholic brother in ''The Most Dangerous Game'' and, during filming, became a member of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle.

Knight]]'s murals in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for ''Creation'' and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and war planes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling and killing the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's proteg\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\n[[File:KingKong001C.png|thumb|Colored publicity shot combining live actors interacting with stop motion animation.]] Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like [[reptile]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 August 1961}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1990}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|authorlink1=Donald F.

Perhaps a human actor was used in a bit of forgotten test footage before the film went into production, but thus far the matter remains a mystery.}}</ref>\n\n===Live-action scenes===\n''King Kong'' was filmed in several stages over an eight-month period. Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver]] war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\"Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded growls of zoo [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>Shay, Don. (1982) ''Cinefex'' issues 7\u201310 page 41</ref>\n\nFor budgetary reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer [[Max Steiner]] to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|accessdate=March 28, 2011|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File:Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.

(2012). The Classical Hollywood Reader. London: Routledge. P.351.</ref> The [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]'s stricter decency rules had been put into effect in Hollywood after its 1933 premiere and it was progressively censored further, with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether.\n\nThese scenes were as follows:<ref name=\"Morton83-4\">Morton 83\u20134</ref>\n*A ''Brontosaurus'' mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him;\n*Kong undressing Ann Darrow and sniffing his fingers;\n*Kong biting and stepping on natives when he attacks the village;\n*Kong biting a reporter in New York;\n*Kong mistaking a sleeping woman for Ann and dropping her to her death, after realizing his mistake.\n*An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a lizard and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong into the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards, and thus the scene was studio self-censored prior to original release. Though searched for, the footage is now considered \"lost forever\" with only a few stills and pre-production drawings <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wednesday |first1=WTM \u2022 |title=The Lost Scene from 1933's King Kong - the Spider Pit |url=https://www.neatorama.com/2018/12/12/The-Lost-Scene-from-1933-s-King-Kong-the-Spider-Pit/ |website=Neatorama |accessdate=28 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television (first being broadcast March 5, 1956).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rainho|first1=Manny|title=This Month in Movie History|journal=Classic Images|date=March 2015|issue=477|page=26}}</ref>\n\nRKO did not preserve copies of film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to [[art house]]s by [[Janus Films]] in 1970.<ref name=\"Morton83-4\"/>\n\nOver the next two decades, [[Universal Studios]] carried out further photochemical restoration on ''King Kong''. This was based on a 1942 release print, with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which \"contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.\"<ref>[http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/dcp/news/king-kong/43148 Millimeter Magazine article, 1 January 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521015000/http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/dcp/news/king-kong/43148 |date=May 21, 2013}} Retrieved: March 15, 2012</ref> An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality.\n\nAfter a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital, restoration utilizing [[4K resolution]] [[Image scanner|scanning]] was completed by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2005.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/articles/robertharris/harris102505.html \"Robert A.

Those included a [[Turner Home Entertainment|Turner]] 60th anniversary edition in 1993 featuring a front cover which had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It also included the colorized version of the film and a 25-minute documentary, ''It Was Beauty Killed the Beast'' (1992). The documentary is also available on two different UK ''King Kong'' DVDs, while the colorized version is available on DVD in the UK and Italy.<ref>[http://dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=2930 DVDCompare.com: ''King Kong'' (1933)] Retrieved: April 8, 2012</ref> [[Warner Home Video]] re-released the black and white version on VHS with the 25-minute documentary included under the ''Warner Bros.

It had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by [[visual effects]] artists [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Ken Ralston]], with archival excerpts from actress [[Fay Wray]] and producer/director [[Merian C.

All Universal's releases only contain their earlier, 100 minute, pre-2005 restoration.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, in the UK, Warner Home Video released the film digitally and on Blu-Ray and DVD in early 2017. The Blu-Ray contained the same contents as the  US release, but unfortunately for the DVD, that was based on the first Disc of the 2-Disc DVD release.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe 1933 ''King Kong'' film and character inspired imitations and installments. ''[[Son of Kong]]'', a direct sequel to the 1933 film was released nine months after the first film's release. In the early 1960s, RKO had licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio [[Toho]] and produced two King Kong films, ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (a crossover with the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' series]]) and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', both directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]].\n\nIn 1976, Italian producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] released his version of [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], a modern remake of the 1933 film, which was followed by a sequel in 1986 titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]''. In 2005, [[Universal Pictures]] released another remake of [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'']], directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] released a Kong reboot film titled ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' in 2017 which was directed by [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]] and is the second installment of a shared universe called the [[MonsterVerse]], which started with Legendary's reboot of '' [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Speculative fiction/Horror|United States}}\n* [[List of films featuring giant monsters]]\n* [[List of stop motion films]]\n* [[1933 in film]]\n* [[List of highest-grossing films]]\n* [[Skull Island]]\n* ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930)\n* ''[[Stark Mad]]'' (1929)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web |author=American Film Institute |author-link=American Film Institute |date=June 17, 2008 |title=AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres |url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 |accessdate=February 20, 2010}}\n*Annette, Kuhn.

Plot summaries for films on Wikipedia are recommended to be between 400-700 words. All edits in this section are logged and reviewed. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nIn [[New York Harbor]], filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], known for wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the ''Venture'', for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate [[Jack Driscoll|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann.\n\nDenham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They rebuff him and return to the ''Venture''.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the wall gate and to an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], an enormous [[gorilla]]-like creature. Kong carries a terrified Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to defeat. After facing a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and Kong himself, Jack and Denham are the only survivors.\n\nA ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Jack continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, shoves Jack aside, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grip. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and then climbs the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes sorrowfully at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fay Wray]] as Ann Darrow\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as [[Jack Driscoll|John \u201cJack\u201d Driscoll]]\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]] as Charles Weston\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as the Native Chief\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as the Witch King\n* [[James Flavin]] as Briggs, 2nd Mate\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie the Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as the Native in [[Ape]] Costume (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Kong (1933), Brontosaur.jpeg|thumb|An articulated skeleton of the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' used in the film.]]\nBefore ''King Kong'' entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films (for example ''[[Stark Mad]]'') generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth.

At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B.

Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)], repr.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading W. Douglas Burden's ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\"Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper called in [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\"Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \u201cmythic elements\u201d, believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\"Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\"Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled ''Kong'' for production.<ref>Morton, p. 28\u20139</ref> Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.<ref>Morton, p. 29</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been principally sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

She met ''Kong'' co-directors Cooper and Schoedsack when cast as Ethne Eustace in ''[[The Four Feathers (1929 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1929).

[[Dorothy Jordan (film actress)|Dorothy Jordan]], [[Jean Harlow]], and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, ''On the Other Hand'', Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the \"tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood\". She assumed he meant [[Clark Gable]] until he showed her a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.<ref name=\"Morton31-3\"/> On the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, one New York theater held a Fay Wray scream-alike contest in its lobby,<ref name=\"erb31\" /> and on August 10, 2004, two days after Wray died, the lights of the [[Empire State Building]] were dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory.<ref>United Press International</ref>\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]\n[[File:Robert Armstrong.JPG|right|thumb|Armstrong featured in [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for later film, ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936)]]\n:[[Michigan]] native and veteran [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[silent film]] character actor [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] played Wray's alcoholic brother in ''The Most Dangerous Game'' and, during filming, became a member of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle.

His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.<ref>Morton 33\u20135</ref>\n[[Image:Img kingkong1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[stop-motion]] animated King Kong atop the [[Empire State Building]] and battling a [[Curtiss F8C Helldiver]] airplane]]\nA huge bust of Kong's head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E.

The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.<ref>Morton 36</ref>\n[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles R.

Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for ''Creation'' and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and war planes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling and killing the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's proteg\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\nAnother technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like [[reptile]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 August 1961}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1990}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|authorlink1=Donald F.

Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City.

Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\"Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded growls of zoo [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>Shay, Don.

Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|accessdate=March 28, 2011|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File:Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.
