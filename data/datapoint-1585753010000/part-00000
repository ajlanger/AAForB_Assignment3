The result was a crushing defeat for the Burgundians at the hands of the Swiss.\n\n==Background==\nStung by his defeat by the [[Swiss Confederation]] at [[Battle of Grandson|Grandson]] in March 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, reorganised his tangled but otherwise mainly intact army at [[Lausanne]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Robert | title = The artillery of the Dukes of Burgundy, 1363\u20131477 | publisher = Boydell Press | location = Rochester, NY | year = 2005 | isbn = 1843831627 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UAL0SfuyUGQC&pg=PA192#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> By the end of May he once again felt ready to march against the Confederates to recover his territories and fortifications in the Pays de [[Vaud]], then march on and attack the city of [[Berne]], his greatest enemy among the Swiss cantons.\n\nHis first objective was the strategic lakeside town of Morat, set on the eastern shore of [[Lake Morat]]. On 11 June 1476, the Burgundians commenced the siege of the well-prepared town, whose forces were commanded by the Bernese general [[Adrian von Bubenberg]].<ref>Vaughn pg. 389</ref> An initial assault was repulsed by a heavy barrage of fire from light guns mounted on the walls, but two great [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] used by the Burgundians were slowly reducing the walls to rubble. By 19 June the Confederate muster was near complete at their camp behind the [[Saane/Sarine|Sarine (Saane) River]]. Only a contingent of some 4,000 men from [[Z\u00fcrich]] had yet to arrive and these were not expected until 22 June.\n\nCharles in the meantime had been kept reasonably well informed of the approach of the Confederate army, though he did nothing to hinder their approach. This is not to say that he was unprepared for the arrival of the Swiss; indeed in typical fashion Charles had prepared an elaborate plan to meet the enemy on ground of his choosing, some {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Morat, dominating their anticipated line of approach. The terrain around the town is quite hilly and he had chosen to rest his left flank artillery on a steeply sloped gorge cut by the Burggraben stream. In the centre, behind an elaborate ditch and palisade entrenchment known as the Grunhag, stood the bulk of Charles' infantry and artillery that were not engaged in besieging Murten itself. These were to fight the Confederation [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] and [[halberd]] blocks to a halt while on the right the massed [[Gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]] would then flank the frontally engaged Swiss, thus creating a killing ground from which there was no escape.\n\nOn 21 June 1476, Charles expected the Confederation forces to attack. He arranged his army and prepared for the coming assault. However, the Swiss commanders decided to wait an additional day for the troops from Z\u00fcrich. After about six hours of waiting Charles ordered his troops to stand down and return to camp.<ref>Vaughan pg. 392</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Schilling battle morat.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the siege of Murten. By [[Diebold Schilling the Younger]], 1513.]]\n[[File:Braun, Schlacht bei Murten.jpg|thumb|Portion of the painting ''Schlacht bei Murten'' by [[Louis Braun]], 1893]]\nOn 22 June 1476, around mid-morning, Charles ordered his treasurer to pay the entire army, expecting the Confederate troops to continue delaying. The orderly lines of the Burgundian army dissolved into chaos as soldiers scattered throughout the camp collecting their pay, eating their midday meal and seeking shelter from the rain. The skeleton force that remained at the Grunhag were surprised when the Swiss army, in battle order, emerged from the woods less than {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}} from their lines.<ref>Smith pg. 193</ref><ref>Vaughan pg. 392</ref> The Confederate vanguard of some 6,000 [[skirmishers]] and all the 1,200 cavalry present erupted out of [[Birchenwald]] Woods to the west of Morat, exactly where Charles had predicted they would appear.\n\nBehind the vanguard came the main body of pikemen, the ''gewalthut'' (centre). Some 10,000 to 12,000 strong, they formed a large wedge with the canton standards in the centre, flanked by halberdiers and an outer ring of pikemen. The rearguard of 6,000 to 8,000 more closely packed pikemen and halberdiers followed the ''gewalthut'' towards the now sparsely manned Grunhag.\n\nAs the Swiss charged downhill into the Burgundian position the artillery managed to fire a few salvoes, killing or maiming several hundred of the overeager Lorrainers. Against the odds the defenders in the Grunhag held the Swiss for some time before a contingent of Swiss found a way through the left flank of the defences near the Burggraben and turned the whole position. The Swiss formed up quickly beyond it and advanced towards Murten and the besieger's camp.\n\nIn the Burgundian camp, there was confusion after the Swiss were sighted, as men rushed to re-form ranks and prepare for battle. In the ducal tent on top of the [[Bois Du Domingue]], a hill overlooking Morat, Charles was quickly armed by his retainers before rushing on horseback to try to coordinate the defence of the camp. But as fast as any unit was formed and moved forward against the Swiss, it was swept aside as various uncoordinated attacks were made against the still compact Confederate battle formations.<ref>Smith pg. 195</ref> There was some resistance from the squadrons of the ducal household who routed the Lorrainers, including [[Ren\u00e9&nbsp;II, Duke of Lorraine]], who was saved only by the arrival of the pikes, against which the gendarmes could only retire, unable to make any impression against them.\n\nCharles managed to muster enough English archers to form a last line of defence before the camp, but these were routed before a bow could be bent, their commander shot by a Swiss skirmisher. Traditionally, the [[Duke of Somerset]] is identified as the commander of the English archers. However, the only Duke of Somerset, [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort]] who was known to have been in Burgundian service died in 1471 at [[Tewkesbury]] in England and therefore could not have been at Murten five years later.<ref>[http://www.jcbrunner.info/hist/1476_morat_somerset.html Jean Claude Brunner \u2013 The Mystery of the dead Duke's Charge] retrieved 10 October 2012</ref>  Then it was every man for himself as Charles ordered the army to fall back which was interpreted as a retreat, which in turn became a rout as all organized resistance ended.\n\nFor some three miles along the lakeside many Burgundians died that day in the rout. The Italian division of some 4,000\u20136,000 men besieging the southern part of Morat probably suffered the worst fate: cut off by the Swiss rearguard and attacked by a sally from the town, they were hunted down along the shore and driven into the lake. As promised, no quarter was granted.\n\nMore fortunate was the Savoyard division under [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]] which was posted in the northern half of the Morat siege works. Forming up and abandoning all their baggage they retreated east round the lake and eventually made good their escape to Romont.\n\nPart of the war booty captured at this battle is still retained at the castle of [[Gruy\u00e8res]] in [[Switzerland]], and includes three capes of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] which belonged to Charles the Bold, including one with the emblem of his father, [[Philip the Good]], which he had with him as he was marking the anniversary of the death of his father.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French poet and chronicler [[Jean Molinet]] reported that Charles' army lost about 6,000 to 7,000 men.<ref>[[Jean Molinet]] (I:146-47) quoted in Smith pg. 196</ref>  Later writers have calculated a higher number, between 9,000 and 10,000.<ref>{{cite book | title=Histoire de l'organisation militaire sous les ducs de Bourgogne | author=Guillaume, Henri Louis Gustave | year=1848 | pages=158 | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=EX11UKTQNano2AXniYCABg&sqi=2&jtp=158&id=AGU_AAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCharles\u2019 dream of revenge against the Confederates ended that day. Although he would doggedly struggle for another six months against his foes, his defeat at Morat really spelled the beginning of the end for the [[Burgundian State]], much to the delight of the duke's enemies. Charles escaped to [[Morges]], and then to [[Pontarlier]], where he stayed for months, reportedly in a deep depression.
