He attended Blossomfield Infant School in Solihull's Sharmans Cross district from the age of 3\u20137.

The show is co-presented with his former ''Top Gear'' co-hosts, Clarkson and May, as an exclusive distributed via [[Prime Video|Amazon Video]] to [[Amazon Prime]] customers.  \n\nIn November 2016, Hammond, alongside the co-presenters of ''[[The Grand Tour]]'', Jeremy Clarkson and James May, launched the automotive social media website [[DriveTribe]], where he regularly provides content on his tribe \"Hammond's Fob Jockeys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://drivetribe.com/t/VXlDRsr_Sy-uZOvUQgQqBg?iid=G6q5v9TgRRubihgUmtAq3g|title=Hammond's Fob Jockeys|publisher=drivetribe.com|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>  He has also presented ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]'' (2003\u20132008), ''[[Total Wipeout]]'' (2009\u20132012) and ''[[Planet Earth Live (TV series)|Planet Earth Live]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life==\nRichard Mark Hammond was born on 19 December 1969 in [[Solihull]], [[Warwickshire]], and is the grandson of workers in the [[Birmingham]] car industry.<ref name=\"Hammond, Richard 2007\">{{cite book|author=Hammond, Richard|title=On The Edge: My Story|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-297-85327-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/exclusions/familyhistory/fd100207.xml|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|title=Family detective: Richard Hammond|first=Nick|last=Barratt|date=12 April 2008|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> In the mid-1980s Hammond moved with his family (mother Eileen, father Alan, and younger brothers Andrew, writer of the 'Crypt' series, and Nicholas) to the [[North Yorkshire]] cathedral city of [[Ripon]] where his father ran a [[probate]] business in the market square. He attended Blossomfield Infant School in Solihull's Sharmans Cross district from the age of 3\u20137. Originally a pupil of [[Solihull School]], a fee-paying boys' independent school, he moved to [[Ripon Grammar School]], and from 1986 to 1988 attended [[Harrogate College|Harrogate College of Art and Technology]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduation, Hammond worked for several BBC radio stations, including [[BBC Tees|Radio Cleveland]], [[BBC Radio York|Radio York]], [[BBC Radio Cumbria|Radio Cumbria]], [[BBC Radio Leeds|Radio Leeds]] and [[BBC Newcastle|Radio Newcastle]].<ref name=BBCAus/>\n\nPresenting the afternoon programme at [[BBC Radio Lancashire|Radio Lancashire]], his regular guests included motoring journalist [[Zogg Zieglar]], who would review a car of the week by being interviewed by Hammond over the phone.

The show also contained images of the crash, which had made international headlines, with Hammond talking through the events of the day after which the audience broke into spontaneous applause.

Oliver features on Hammond's children's science television show ''[[Richard Hammond's Blast Lab]]'' and in another episode of ''Top Gear'' as a kind of \"Hill-holder\" in the trailer truck challenge (after it acquired the fake personal plate \"OLI V3R\").
