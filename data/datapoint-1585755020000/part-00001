Indeed, [[Saint Herman of Alaska]], the member of the original Russian missionary team from Valaam Monastery and America\u2019s first canonized Orthodox saint, had lived here for more than twenty years, until his death in 1836. Today two monastic communities\u2014Saint Archangel Michael Skete for men and Saint Nilus Skete for women\u2014live in close proximity to St. Herman\u2019s hermitage and strive to follow St. Herman\u2019s example of prayer, simplicity, and living off the land and sea. The two [[skete]]s, affiliated with Saint Herman of Alaska Monastery in [[Platina, California]], are under the jurisdiction of Bishop [[Maksim Vasiljevi\u0107]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in North and South America.\n\n==Education==\nThe Ouzinkie School, a K-12 rural school, is operated by the [[Kodiak Island Borough School District]].<ref>\"[http://www.kibsd.org/domain/304 Our Schools].\" [[Kodiak Island Borough School District]].

The population density was 37.3 people per square mile (14.4/km\u00b2).  There were 86 housing units at an average density of 14.3 per square&nbsp;mile (5.5/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the hamlet was 11.11% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 80.89% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], and 8.00% from two or more races.  4.44% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 74 households out of which 44.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.4% were married couples living together, 20.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.3% were non-families. 21.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Indeed, [[Saint Herman of Alaska]], the member of the original Russian missionary team from Valaam Monastery and America\u2019s first canonized Orthodox saint, had lived here for more than twenty years, until his death in 1836. Today two monastic communities\u2014Saint Archangel Michael Skete for men and Saint Nilus Skete for women\u2014live in close proximity to St. Herman\u2019s hermitage and strive to follow St. Herman\u2019s example of prayer, simplicity, and living off the land and sea. The two [[skete]]s, affiliated with Saint Herman of Alaska Monastery in [[Platina, California]], are under the jurisdiction of Bishop [[Maksim Vasiljevi\u0107]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in North and South America.\n\n==Education==\nThe Ouzinkie School, a K-12 rural school, is operated by the [[Kodiak Island Borough School District]].<ref>\"[http://www.kibsd.org/domain/304 Our Schools].\" [[Kodiak Island Borough School District]].
