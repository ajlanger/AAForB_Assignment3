He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], again with Ritschl's support.<ref>Anthony K.

His inaugural lecture at the university was \"[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]\". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.<ref>Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\nNietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle\u2014including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: \"Liszt or the art of running after women!\".<ref>[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].</ref> Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of \"The Genesis of the Tragic Idea\" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] damped the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]\n\nIn 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: \"[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer\", \"On the Use and Abuse of History for Life\", \"Schopenhauer as Educator\" and \"Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul R\u00e9e]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of \"German culture\", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.\n\nWith the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''<ref>Safranski, R\u00fcdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W.W. Norton & Company, 2003. \"This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I \u00a7&nbsp;18).\"</ref> and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.\n\n=== Independent philosopher (1879\u20131888) ===\n{{anchor|independent philosopher|philosopher}}\n[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9|Lou Salom\u00e9]], [[Paul R\u00e9e]] and Nietzsche traveled through Italy in 1882, planning to establish an educational commune together, but the friendship disintegrated in late 1882 due to complications from R\u00e9e's and Nietzsche's mutual romantic interest in Salom\u00e9.]]\n\nLiving off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.<ref>{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=G\u00fcntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.</ref> Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.\n\nWhile in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich K\u00f6selitz]] or [[Heinrich K\u00f6selitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul R\u00e9e.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''), Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as \"superfluous\" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}\n\nTo the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.\n\nIn 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9]],<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9 |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}</ref> through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul R\u00e9e]].\n\nSalom\u00e9's mother took her to Rome when Salom\u00e9 was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salom\u00e9 became acquainted with [[Paul R\u00e9e]]. R\u00e9e proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as \"brother and sister\", along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} R\u00e9e accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as R\u00e9e had done. Nietzsche asked R\u00e9e to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with R\u00e9e and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. The three traveled with Salom\u00e9's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their \"Winterplan\" commune. This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the \"immoral woman\".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}}\nNietzsche and Salom\u00e9 spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salom\u00e9 reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salom\u00e9 and R\u00e9e separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salom\u00e9, in which Salom\u00e9 believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.\n\nWhile the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month R\u00e9e and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe (today [[Zdbowo]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JkoK_108xJkC&lpg=PT223&dq=Stibbe+Zdbowo+Nietzsche&pg=PT223#v=onepage&q=Stibbe%20Zdbowo%20Nietzsche&f=false|title=Plett \u2013 Schmidseder|last=Killy|first=Walther|last2=Vierhaus|first2=Rudolf|date=30 November 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-096630-5|language=en}}</ref> in Poland) without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to R\u00e9e, stating \"We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?\"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, R\u00e9e, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and R\u00e9e to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt \"genuine hatred for my sister\".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}\n\nAmidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salom\u00e9, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' in only ten days.\n[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo of Nietzsche by {{interlanguage link|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]\n\nBy 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them \"Dr. Nietzsche\".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}\n\nAfter severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].\n\nIn 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent \"feelings of revenge and resentment\" embittered him: \"And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast \u2013 August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as \"completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump\" of Schmeitzner\u2014associating the publisher with a movement that should be \"utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].\n\nIn 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard F\u00f6rster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a \"Germanic\" colony\u2014a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |edition= online |contribution=F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ticotimes.net/2016/02/27/the-lost-aryan-utopia-of-nueva-germania|title=The lost 'Aryan utopia' of Nueva Germania|last=van Eerten|first=Jurriaan|date=27 February 2016|website=The Tico Times Costa Rica|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.\n\nIn 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast \u2013 March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.</ref> He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.<ref>{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche.

In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and \"fate\". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface\u2014which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate\u2014he declares, \"Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else.\"{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.\n\n=== Mental illness and death (1889\u20131900) ===\n{{anchor|mental breakdown and death|breakdown|death}}\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche drawn by Hans Olde.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing by [[Hans Olde]] from the photographic series, ''The Ill Nietzsche'', late 1899]]\n[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]\n\nOn 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36767-7|pages=79\u201381|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xeb80itrlRIC|language=en}}</ref> Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]].

Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]],'' the poet [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy,'' Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled \"On Music and Words\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm|title=On Music and Words and Rhetoric|website=nietzsche.holtof.com}}</ref> In it, he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.\n\nNietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' (\"artistic impulses\") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity, and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion, and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other, formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]:<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&pg=PA69&dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art|isbn=978-1-4443-9600-3|last1=Desmond|first1=Kathleen K|year= 2011}}</ref> the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries.

Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to act at all. Hamlet falls under this category\u2014he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche|title=Hamlet and Nietzsche|website=Issuu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)|year=2006}}</ref> For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity,'' which revives Dionysian nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables the creation of any art.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html|title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy|website=jorbon.tripod.com}}</ref> Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:\n\n<blockquote>In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power\u2014until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is\u2014art.</blockquote>\n\nNietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally \"going under\" or \"downward-way\", meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued along this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian, thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/|title=Dionysos versus Apollo|website=www.carnaval.com}}</ref> He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion.

He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the merit of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far\", says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goals\". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible\u2014but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view|journal=Teoria & Sociedade|volume=2|issue=SE|page=0|date=2006|last1=Nobre|first1=Renarde Freire}}</ref>\n\nAmong his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]],'' Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' (\"I think, therefore I am\") as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism|year=2011}}</ref> Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy.

For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of \"good and bad\" toward \"good and evil\".\n\nThe initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this \"master morality\" as the original system of morality\u2014perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece.<ref name=\"LacewingSlave\">{{cite web|url=http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Nietzsche/NietzscheMasterSlave.pdf|title=Nietzsche on master and slave morality|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|last2=Lacewing|first2=Michael|date=|website=Amazon Online Web Services|publisher=Routledge Taylor & Francis Group|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510060210/http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Nietzsche/NietzscheMasterSlave.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2016|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref> To be \"good\" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be \"bad\" was to be like the slaves over whom the aristocracy ruled: poor, weak, sick, pathetic\u2014objects of pity or disgust rather than hatred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html#1.|title=Nietzsche, \"Master and Slave Morality\"|website=philosophy.lander.edu|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n\n\"Slave morality\" developed as a reaction to master morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; while evil is worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, its values emerging to improve the self-perception of slaves. He associates slave morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, as it is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without despising themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people\u2014in success, strength, beauty, and intelligence\u2014slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting master morality, which frustrated them. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before their (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness, for example, to be a matter of choice, by relabeling it as \"meekness\". The \"good man\" of master morality is precisely the \"evil man\" of slave morality, while the \"bad man\" is recast as the \"good man\".<ref name=\"LacewingSlave\" />\n\nNietzsche sees slave morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both contradictory values determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are \"[[motley]]\"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own \"inner law\".<ref name=\"LacewingSlave\" /> A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: \"Become what you are.\"<ref name=\"KYLook\">{{cite web |last1=Look |first1=Brandon |title='Becoming Who One Is' in Spinoza and Nietzsche |url=http://www.uky.edu/~look/essays/Spinoza&Nietzsche.pdf |website=uky.edu |publisher=University of Kentucky |accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nA long-standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, eminent Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were used only in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense; they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorification.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&pg=PA213&dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=978-0-691-01367-1|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}</ref> On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche hoped for the victory of master morality. He linked the \"salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1887|isbn=|location=|page=First essay, section 16}}</ref> of master morality and called master morality \"a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1908|isbn=|location=|page=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}</ref> Just as \"there is an order of rank between man and man\", there is also an order of rank \"between morality and morality\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1886|isbn=|location=|page=Section 228}}</ref> Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his \"revaluation of all values\" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the \"philosophy of the future\" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9975703-0-4|location=|pages=31\u201338, 60\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]],'' Nietzsche begins his \"Campaign against Morality\". {{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an \"immoralist\" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]].

On the basis of it, most commentators<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-8371-7404-4}}</ref> regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism\u2014the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, \"If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.\"{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}\n\nOne such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism,'' which he recognizes in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine\u2014which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]\u2014advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterizes this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a \"will to nothingness\", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:<ref>This \"will to nothingness\" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]\". III:7</ref>\n\n{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist.

Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]</ref> Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that \"I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!\"<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.</ref> According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement \"God is dead\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hankey|first=Wayne J.|last2=Center|first2=Philosophy Documentation|title=Why Heidegger's \"History\" of Metaphysics is Dead|url=https://www.academia.edu/11651293|journal=American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=425\u2013443|issn=1051-3558|doi=10.5840/acpq200478325|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n=== Will to power ===\n{{Main|Will to power}}\n\nA basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the \"[[will to power]]\" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior\u2014more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence.'{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, \u00a7&nbsp;14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.\n\nIn presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,<ref>[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality,'' p. 121</ref> and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''\u2014it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions\u2014in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=\u00a7&nbsp;2}}\n\nRelated to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a7&nbsp;36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter\u2014that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]\u2014the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.<ref>Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, \"Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story\", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.</ref>{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a7&nbsp;12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as \"the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation\" revealing the will to power as \"the principle of the synthesis of forces\".{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a7&nbsp;22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than Aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil,'' where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, they argue, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. And they also claim that Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Project MUSE \u2013 Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201368 |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |date=14 June 2006 |last1=Leddy |first1=Thomas }}</ref> According to these scholars, the 'burning' story supports their thesis that at the end of his lucid life, Nietzsche rejected his project on the will to power. However, a recent study (Huang 2019) shows that although it is true that in 1888 Nietzsche wanted some of his notes burned, the 'burning' story indicates little about his project on the will to power, not only because only 11 'aphorisms' saved from the flames were ultimately incorporated into ''The Will to Power'' (this book contains 1067 'aphorisms'), but also because these abandoned notes mainly focus on topics such as critique of morality while touching upon the 'feeling of power' only once.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Did Nietzsche want his notes burned?

It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter \"Of the Vision and the Riddle\" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176\u201380}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially \"horrifying and paralyzing\", and says that its burden is the \"heaviest weight\" imaginable (\"''das schwerste Gewicht''\").<ref>{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}</ref> The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will\u2010to\u2010live.

According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence\u2014whether or not such a thing could possibly be true\u2014that is so significant in modern thought: \"The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'\"<ref>See Heidegger, ''Nietzsche.

Finally, \"(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion.\" Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas, 153).

The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSome have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\nThe Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914\u20131918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];<ref name=\"Golomb 2002\" /> 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work, and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].<ref>Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33\u201334.</ref> Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism\u2014and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a 29 March 1887 letter to [[Theodor Fritsch]], Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, [[Eugen D\u00fchring]], Wagner, Ebrard<!-- is it [[Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard]] ? -->, [[Adolf Wahrmund|Wahrmund]], and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, [[Paul de Lagarde]], who would become, along with Wagner and [[Houston Chamberlain]], the main official influences of [[Nazism]].<ref name=Bataille /> This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: \"And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?\"<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150815060910/http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1887.htm March 29, 1887 letter] to [[Theodor Fritsch]] {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n=== Critique of mass culture ===\nFriedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture.

While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a \"lost link\" in the development of his thought. \"In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of \"flux\" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as \"child play\" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37\u201339}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}\n\nIn his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was \"an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}\n\nNietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re|La Bruy\u00e8re]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],<ref>Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 \"Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld\"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303\u201318</ref> as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc=\"Why I am So Clever\", \u00a7&nbsp;3}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,<ref>Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 \"F\u00e9r\u00e9 et Nietzsche: au sujet de la d\u00e9cadence\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{in lang|fr}}.

However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.<ref>See [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]</ref> Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894\u20131895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.<ref>O.

His inaugural lecture at the university was \"[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]\". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.<ref>Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\nNietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle\u2014including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: \"Liszt or the art of running after women!\".<ref>[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].</ref> Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of \"The Genesis of the Tragic Idea\" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] damped the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]\n\nIn 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: \"[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer\", \"On the Use and Abuse of History for Life\", \"Schopenhauer as Educator\" and \"Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul R\u00e9e]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of \"German culture\", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.\n\nWith the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''<ref>Safranski, R\u00fcdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W.W. Norton & Company, 2003. \"This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I \u00a7&nbsp;18).\"</ref> and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.\n\n=== Independent philosopher (1879\u20131888) ===\n{{anchor|independent philosopher|philosopher}}\n[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9|Lou Salom\u00e9]], [[Paul R\u00e9e]] and Nietzsche traveled through Italy in 1882, planning to establish an educational commune together, but the friendship disintegrated in late 1882 due to complications from R\u00e9e's and Nietzsche's mutual romantic interest in Salom\u00e9.]]\n\nLiving off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.<ref>{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=G\u00fcntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.</ref> Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.\n\nWhile in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich K\u00f6selitz]] or [[Heinrich K\u00f6selitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul R\u00e9e.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''), Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as \"superfluous\" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}\n\nTo the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.\n\nIn 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9]],<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9 |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}</ref> through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul R\u00e9e]].\n\nSalom\u00e9's mother took her to Rome when Salom\u00e9 was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salom\u00e9 became acquainted with [[Paul R\u00e9e]]. R\u00e9e proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as \"brother and sister\", along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} R\u00e9e accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as R\u00e9e had done. Nietzsche asked R\u00e9e to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with R\u00e9e and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. The three traveled with Salom\u00e9's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their \"Winterplan\" commune. This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the \"immoral woman\".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}}\nNietzsche and Salom\u00e9 spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salom\u00e9 reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salom\u00e9 and R\u00e9e separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salom\u00e9, in which Salom\u00e9 believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.\n\nWhile the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month R\u00e9e and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe (today [[Zdbowo]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JkoK_108xJkC&lpg=PT223&dq=Stibbe+Zdbowo+Nietzsche&pg=PT223#v=onepage&q=Stibbe%20Zdbowo%20Nietzsche&f=false|title=Plett \u2013 Schmidseder|last=Killy|first=Walther|last2=Vierhaus|first2=Rudolf|date=30 November 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-096630-5|language=en}}</ref> in Poland) without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to R\u00e9e, stating \"We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?\"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, R\u00e9e, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and R\u00e9e to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt \"genuine hatred for my sister\".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}\n\nAmidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salom\u00e9, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' in only ten days.\n[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo of Nietzsche by {{interlanguage link|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]\n\nBy 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them \"Dr. Nietzsche\".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}\n\nAfter severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].\n\nIn 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent \"feelings of revenge and resentment\" embittered him: \"And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast \u2013 August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as \"completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump\" of Schmeitzner\u2014associating the publisher with a movement that should be \"utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].\n\nIn 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard F\u00f6rster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a \"Germanic\" colony\u2014a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |edition= online |contribution=F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ticotimes.net/2016/02/27/the-lost-aryan-utopia-of-nueva-germania|title=The lost 'Aryan utopia' of Nueva Germania|last=van Eerten|first=Jurriaan|date=27 February 2016|website=The Tico Times Costa Rica|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.\n\nIn 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast \u2013 March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.</ref> He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.<ref>{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche.

In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and \"fate\". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface\u2014which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate\u2014he declares, \"Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else.\"{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.\n\n=== Mental illness and death (1889\u20131900) ===\n{{anchor|mental breakdown and death|breakdown|death}}\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche drawn by Hans Olde.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing by [[Hans Olde]] from the photographic series, ''The Ill Nietzsche'', late 1899]]\n[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]\n\nOn 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36767-7|pages=79\u201381|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xeb80itrlRIC|language=en}}</ref> Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]].

Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]],'' the poet [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy,'' Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled \"On Music and Words\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm|title=On Music and Words and Rhetoric|website=nietzsche.holtof.com}}</ref> In it, he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.\n\nNietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' (\"artistic impulses\") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity, and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion, and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other, formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]:<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&pg=PA69&dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art|isbn=978-1-4443-9600-3|last1=Desmond|first1=Kathleen K|year= 2011}}</ref> the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries.

Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to act at all. Hamlet falls under this category\u2014he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche|title=Hamlet and Nietzsche|website=Issuu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)|year=2006}}</ref> For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity,'' which revives Dionysian nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables the creation of any art.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html|title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy|website=jorbon.tripod.com}}</ref> Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:\n\n<blockquote>In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power\u2014until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is\u2014art.</blockquote>\n\nNietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally \"going under\" or \"downward-way\", meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued along this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian, thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/|title=Dionysos versus Apollo|website=www.carnaval.com}}</ref> He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion.

He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the merit of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far\", says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goals\". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible\u2014but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view|journal=Teoria & Sociedade|volume=2|issue=SE|page=0|date=2006|last1=Nobre|first1=Renarde Freire}}</ref>\n\nAmong his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]],'' Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' (\"I think, therefore I am\") as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism|year=2011}}</ref> Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy.

For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of \"good and bad\" toward \"good and evil\".\n\nThe initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this \"master morality\" as the original system of morality\u2014perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece.<ref name=\"LacewingSlave\">{{cite web|url=http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Nietzsche/NietzscheMasterSlave.pdf|title=Nietzsche on master and slave morality|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|last2=Lacewing|first2=Michael|date=|website=Amazon Online Web Services|publisher=Routledge Taylor & Francis Group|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510060210/http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Nietzsche/NietzscheMasterSlave.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2016|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref> To be \"good\" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be \"bad\" was to be like the slaves over whom the aristocracy ruled: poor, weak, sick, pathetic\u2014objects of pity or disgust rather than hatred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html#1.|title=Nietzsche, \"Master and Slave Morality\"|website=philosophy.lander.edu|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n\n\"Slave morality\" developed as a reaction to master morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; while evil is worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, its values emerging to improve the self-perception of slaves. He associates slave morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, as it is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without despising themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people\u2014in success, strength, beauty, and intelligence\u2014slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting master morality, which frustrated them. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before their (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness, for example, to be a matter of choice, by relabeling it as \"meekness\". The \"good man\" of master morality is precisely the \"evil man\" of slave morality, while the \"bad man\" is recast as the \"good man\".<ref name=\"LacewingSlave\" />\n\nNietzsche sees slave morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both contradictory values determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are \"[[motley]]\"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own \"inner law\".<ref name=\"LacewingSlave\" /> A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: \"Become what you are.\"<ref name=\"KYLook\">{{cite web |last1=Look |first1=Brandon |title='Becoming Who One Is' in Spinoza and Nietzsche |url=http://www.uky.edu/~look/essays/Spinoza&Nietzsche.pdf |website=uky.edu |publisher=University of Kentucky |accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nA long-standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, eminent Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were used only in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense; they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorification.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&pg=PA213&dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=978-0-691-01367-1|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}</ref> On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche hoped for the victory of master morality. He linked the \"salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1887|isbn=|location=|page=First essay, section 16}}</ref> of master morality and called master morality \"a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1908|isbn=|location=|page=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}</ref> Just as \"there is an order of rank between man and man\", there is also an order of rank \"between morality and morality\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1886|isbn=|location=|page=Section 228}}</ref> Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his \"revaluation of all values\" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the \"philosophy of the future\" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9975703-0-4|location=|pages=31\u201338, 60\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]],'' Nietzsche begins his \"Campaign against Morality\". {{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an \"immoralist\" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]].

On the basis of it, most commentators<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-8371-7404-4}}</ref> regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism\u2014the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, \"If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.\"{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}\n\nOne such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism,'' which he recognizes in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine\u2014which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]\u2014advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterizes this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a \"will to nothingness\", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:<ref>This \"will to nothingness\" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]\". III:7</ref>\n\n{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist.

Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]</ref> Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that \"I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!\"<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.</ref> According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement \"God is dead\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hankey|first=Wayne J.|last2=Center|first2=Philosophy Documentation|title=Why Heidegger's \"History\" of Metaphysics is Dead|url=https://www.academia.edu/11651293|journal=American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=425\u2013443|issn=1051-3558|doi=10.5840/acpq200478325|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n=== Will to power ===\n{{Main|Will to power}}\n\nA basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the \"[[will to power]]\" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior\u2014more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence.'{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, \u00a7&nbsp;14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.\n\nIn presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,<ref>[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality,'' p. 121</ref> and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''\u2014it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions\u2014in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=\u00a7&nbsp;2}}\n\nRelated to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a7&nbsp;36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter\u2014that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]\u2014the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.<ref>Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, \"Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story\", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.</ref>{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a7&nbsp;12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as \"the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation\" revealing the will to power as \"the principle of the synthesis of forces\".{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a7&nbsp;22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than Aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil,'' where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, they argue, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. And they also claim that Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Project MUSE \u2013 Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201368 |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |date=14 June 2006 |last1=Leddy |first1=Thomas }}</ref> According to these scholars, the 'burning' story supports their thesis that at the end of his lucid life, Nietzsche rejected his project on the will to power. However, a recent study (Huang 2019) shows that although it is true that in 1888 Nietzsche wanted some of his notes burned, the 'burning' story indicates little about his project on the will to power, not only because only 11 'aphorisms' saved from the flames were ultimately incorporated into ''The Will to Power'' (this book contains 1067 'aphorisms'), but also because these abandoned notes mainly focus on topics such as critique of morality while touching upon the 'feeling of power' only once.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Did Nietzsche want his notes burned?

It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter \"Of the Vision and the Riddle\" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176\u201380}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially \"horrifying and paralyzing\", and says that its burden is the \"heaviest weight\" imaginable (\"''das schwerste Gewicht''\").<ref>{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}</ref> The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will\u2010to\u2010live.

According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence\u2014whether or not such a thing could possibly be true\u2014that is so significant in modern thought: \"The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'\"<ref>See Heidegger, ''Nietzsche.

Finally, \"(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion.\" Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas, 153).

The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSome have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\nThe Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914\u20131918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];<ref name=\"Golomb 2002\" /> 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work, and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].<ref>Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33\u201334.</ref> Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism\u2014and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a 29 March 1887 letter to [[Theodor Fritsch]], Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, [[Eugen D\u00fchring]], Wagner, Ebrard<!-- is it [[Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard]] ? -->, [[Adolf Wahrmund|Wahrmund]], and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, [[Paul de Lagarde]], who would become, along with Wagner and [[Houston Chamberlain]], the main official influences of [[Nazism]].<ref name=Bataille /> This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: \"And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?\"<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150815060910/http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1887.htm March 29, 1887 letter] to [[Theodor Fritsch]] {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n=== Critique of mass culture ===\nFriedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture.

While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a \"lost link\" in the development of his thought. \"In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of \"flux\" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as \"child play\" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37\u201339}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}\n\nIn his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was \"an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}\n\nNietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re|La Bruy\u00e8re]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],<ref>Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 \"Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld\"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303\u201318</ref> as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc=\"Why I am So Clever\", \u00a7&nbsp;3}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,<ref>Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 \"F\u00e9r\u00e9 et Nietzsche: au sujet de la d\u00e9cadence\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{in lang|fr}}.

However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.<ref>See [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]</ref> Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894\u20131895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.<ref>O.
