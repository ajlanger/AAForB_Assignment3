In 1966 he was appointed by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Bertie Mee]] as the Gunners' first-team coach, but a year later returned to Chelsea to become manager following the departure of [[Tommy Docherty]]. He led the club to [[1970 FA Cup Final|FA Cup success in 1970]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] a year later. Chelsea also reached the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final in 1972, but lost to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].  However, Sexton fell out with several players, including [[Peter Osgood]] and [[Alan Hudson]], who were subsequently sold. This, combined with other problems at the club, ensured that Sexton did not come close to repeating his earlier success and early in the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] season \u2013 which ended in Chelsea's relegation \u2013 he was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dave Sexton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/9704066/Dave-Sexton.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 November 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later in October 1974 he was appointed manager of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] as successor to [[Gordon Jago]].

Still, second place was \u2013 and remains \u2013 their highest league finish. [[UEFA Cup]] qualification came as consolation.\n\nSexton took over at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] \u2013 again succeeding Tommy Docherty \u2013 in the middle of 1977 but his reign was characterised by dour football and he was not popular with the fans. In appointing Sexton it appeared as if the United board had again opted for safety following the tumultuous tenure of Docherty (sacked for having an affair with the wife of the club's physiotherapist), whose four-and-a-half-year spell had overseen relegation from the First Division but an immediate comeback followed by high league finishes and completed with an FA Cup triumph in the season before Sexton's appointment.\n\nThe highlight was an FA Cup final appearance in 1979, losing 3\u20132 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a dramatic match, and finishing as league runners-up to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]].<ref name=indy>{{cite web |first=Ivan |last=Ponting |title=Dave Sexton: Footballer who went on to manage Chelsea, QPR and Manchester United |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dave-sexton-footballer-who-went-on-to-manage-chelsea-qpr-and-manchester-united-8348837.html |work=The Independent |date=26 November 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2012 }}</ref> His signings brought mixed success.

On a less positive note, Sexton paid a club record \u00a31.25&nbsp;million for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] striker [[Garry Birtles]] in 1980, but a player who had been one of the country's finest goalscorers with his old club failed to find the net once in 25 league appearances during the [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381 season]].\n\nSexton was dismissed on 30 April 1981,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FIlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iT8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5038,221523&dq=dave-sexton&hl=en|title=Pair fired|agency=Reuters|newspaper=[[Leader-Post]]|location=Regina|date=1 May 1981|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> despite having won his final seven games in charge, as United had finished eighth in the league and Sexton had now been in charge of them for four seasons without winning a major trophy. The FA Cup final appearance two years earlier and the narrow second-place finish behind Liverpool a year earlier was of little consolation.\n\nA few weeks after being dismissed, he was appointed as manager of [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. In his first season, he managed a relatively average 14th-place finish (which was still a slight improvement on the previous year), and the club appeared to be making progress, with the side mounting a serious challenge for the UEFA Cup places halfway through the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]]. However, a disastrous end to the campaign saw them win just once in their last fifteen games, with the club only avoiding relegation in the penultimate game of the season, which led to Sexton's dismissal. This would prove to be his last role in club management.\n\nSexton also had a very successful period as coach of the [[England national under-21 football team|England's Under-21 side]], and won the UEFA Under 21s Championship twice, in [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1982|1982]] and [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1984|1984]]. After that he went on the become the FA's first Technical Director at the FA's National School at Lilleshall in 1984. He also wrote a book on coaching a football team for coaches of all levels called \"Tackle Soccer.\"\n\nHe later lived in [[Kenilworth]], [[Warwickshire]], where in 2008 he was commemorated with a new building in the town centre. He lived in Kenilworth after becoming Coventry City manager in 1981 and the building in his honour, Sexton House, is a refurbished building divided between shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web

However, a disastrous end to the campaign saw them win just once in their last fifteen games, with the club only avoiding relegation in the penultimate game of the season, which led to Sexton's dismissal. This would prove to be his last role in club management.\n\nSexton also had a very successful period as coach of the [[England national under-21 football team|England's Under-21 side]], and won the UEFA Under 21s Championship twice, in [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1982|1982]] and [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1984|1984]]. After that he went on the become the FA's first Technical Director at the FA's National School at Lilleshall in 1984. He also wrote a book on coaching a football team for coaches of all levels called \"Tackle Soccer.\"\n\nHe later lived in [[Kenilworth]], [[Warwickshire]], where in 2008 he was commemorated with a new building in the town centre. He lived in Kenilworth after becoming Coventry City manager in 1981 and the building in his honour, Sexton House, is a refurbished building divided between shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sexton's namesake house is 'up there with OBE' |url=http://www.kenilworthweeklynews.co.uk/news/Sextons-namesake-house-is-up.4713885.jp |work=Kenilworth Weekly News |date=17 November 2008 |accessdate=26 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Player===\n;Leyton Orient\n*[[Football League Third Division|Third Division South]] (1): [[1954\u201355 Football League|1954\u201355]]\n\n;Brighton & Hove Albion\n*[[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] (1): [[1957\u201358 Football League|1957\u201358]]\n\n===Manager===\n;Chelsea\n*[[FA Cup]] (1): [[1970 FA Cup Final|1969\u201370]]\n*[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] (1): [[1970\u201371 European Cup Winners' Cup|1970\u201371]]\n\n;Manchester United\n*[[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] (1): [[1977 FA Charity Shield|1977]] (shared)\n\n;England Under-21\n*[[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|UEFA U21 Championship]] (2): [[1982 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1982]], [[1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1984]]\n\n===Individual===\n*[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (services to football): 2005\n\n==Managerial statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Nat\n!rowspan=\"2\"|From\n!rowspan=\"2\"|To\n!colspan=\"5\"|Record\n|-\n!G!!W!!L!!D!!Win %\n|-\n|align=left|[[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|January 1965\n|align=left|December 1965\n{{WDL|37|7|20|10}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|October 1967\n|align=left|October 1974\n{{WDL|333|140|93|100}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|October 1974\n|align=left|July 1977\n{{WDL|130|57|41|32}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|July 1977\n|align=left|April 1981\n{{WDL|191|75|52|64}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21s]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|1977\n|align=left|1990\n{{WDL|90|52|16|22}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|May 1981\n|align=left|May 1983\n{{WDL|88|28|39|21}}\n|-\n|align=left|[[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21s]]\n|{{flagicon|England}}\n|align=left|1994\n|align=left|1996\n{{WDL|27|17|8|2}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{soccerbase (manager)|id=331|name=Dave Sexton}}\n\n{{UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winning managers}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Dave Sexton managerial positions\n|list1=\n{{Leyton Orient F.C. managers}}\n{{Chelsea F.C. managers}}\n{{Queens Park Rangers F.C. managers}}\n{{Manchester United F.C. managers}}\n{{England national under-21 football team Managers}}\n{{Coventry City F.C. managers}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sexton, Dave}}\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:2012 deaths]]\n[[Category:Place of death missing]]\n[[Category:Footballers from Islington (district)]]\n[[Category:People educated at St Ignatius' College, Enfield]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n[[Category:Newmarket Town F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Chelmsford City F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Luton Town F.C. players]]\n[[Category:West Ham United F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players]]\n[[Category:English football managers]]\n[[Category:Leyton Orient F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Chelsea F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Manchester United F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Coventry City F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Arsenal F.C. non-playing staff]]\n[[Category:Aston Villa F.C. non-playing staff]]\n[[Category:Chelsea F.C. non-playing staff]]\n[[Category:England national under-21 football team managers]]\n[[Category:Association football forwards]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sexton"}
