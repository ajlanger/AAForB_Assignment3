The Crofton family had come to Ireland from England in the sixteenth century and acquired substantial estates in Roscommon. The elder Sir Edward was noted for his loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]] during the [[English Civil War]], and at the [[Restoration of Charles II]] he was rewarded by  being created a  [[baronet]],  the first of the [[Crofton Baronets]]. Little is known for certain of Susanna's background, but there is a tradition in the Crofton family that she  belonged to a junior branch of the family of [[Baron Clifford of Chudleigh]].\n\nTwo years after his father's death in 1675 his mother remarried [[Garrett Dillon]], a prominent [[Roman Catholic]] [[barrister]] who during the reign of the Catholic King [[James II of England]] rose to a position of influence   in Ireland, and was appointed [[Recorder of Dublin]]. Garrett and his stepson seem to have been estranged by the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and Susanna's death sometime before 1689 broke any  family tie between them.\n\n==After the Glorious Revolution==\n\nWhen James II landed in Ireland, in order to recover  his three kingdoms, Edward's stepfather Garrett Dillon remained loyal to his cause and sat in the so-called [[Patriot Parliament]] of 1689. Edward, described as a young man of \"sturdy and resolute character\", was by contrast  a convinced supporter of the Revolution. He greatly admired King [[William III of England]], even composing verses in his honour. In consequence the Patriot Parliament [[attainted]] him, and he fled to London with his wife and two young sons; his wife died while they were in England. After the [[Battle of the Boyne]], which effectively destroyed the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause, Edward's lands were quickly restored to him. By contrast, his stepfather was subject to increasing harassment during the 1690s: he eventually fled the country and died in exile. There is no evidence that Edward interceded on his behalf: possibly  he was taking his revenge on Garrett for voting in the Patriot Parliament to attaint him.\n\nHe was MP for [[Boyle (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Boyle]] in the [[Parliament of Ireland]] of 1695\u201399, and for [[Roscommon County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Roscommon]] from 1703\u20131727. He was a member of the Privy Council in 1713-4. He died in 1729.\n\n==Descendants==\n\nHe married in 1685 Katherine, daughter of [[Sir Oliver St George, 1st Baronet]], and  his wife  Olivia Beresford. Katherine died in 1689 or 1690. They had two sons:\n\n*Sir Edward Crofton, 3rd Baronet\n*Oliver,  who became a soldier, and died during the [[Quebec Expedition]] of 1711; he was the father of\n\n*Sir Oliver Crofton, 5th Baronet.\n\nEdward's male line ended with the 5th  Baronet's death in 1780. The Crofton baronets of the second creation, who later acquired the title [[Baron Crofton]], are his descendants in the female line through a daughter of  Sir Edward Crofton,  4th Baronet.\n\n==References==\n*Ball, F.
