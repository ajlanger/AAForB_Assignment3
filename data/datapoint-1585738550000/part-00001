Lawler came back to get a win over fellow boxing and wrestling specialist [[Chris Lytle]] via unanimous decision at [[UFC 45]].\n\nIn his next UFC bout, Lawler faced former [[List of WEC champions#Welterweight Championship|WEC Welterweight Champion]] and future longtime [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Welterweight Champion]] [[Nick Diaz]] at [[UFC 47]]. Lawler was handed the first of only two [[knockout]] losses of his career to date in the second round.

After pulling out again due to the same circumstances,\nICON Sport stripped Lawler of the middleweight title on February 9, 2008 for failing to defend the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=5668|title=LAWLER STRIPPED OF ICON SPORT TITLE|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLawler defended his [[Elite Xtreme Combat#EliteXC Champions|EliteXC Middleweight Championship]] against [[Scott Smith (fighter)|Scott Smith]] at [[EliteXC: Primetime]] on May 31, 2008, at the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], which ended in a no contest after Smith caught an accidental finger in the eye from Lawler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fight.proelite.com/elitexc-primetime.html|title=Welcome to ProElite.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn July 26, 2008, Lawler and [[Scott Smith (fighter)|Scott Smith]] had their rematch at [[EliteXC: Unfinished Business]].
