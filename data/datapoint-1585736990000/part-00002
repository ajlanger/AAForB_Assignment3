While [[tattoo]]s are generally considered permanent, it is now possible to remove them with treatments, fully or partially.\n\nThe \"standard modality for tattoo removal\"<ref name=\"Sardana\"/> is the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigments using [[Q-switched lasers]]. Different types of Q-switched lasers are used to target different colors of tattoo ink depending on the specific light absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments. \nTypically, black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely using Q-switched lasers while lighter colors such as yellows and greens are still very difficult to remove. Success can depend on a wide variety of factors including skin color, ink color, and the depth at which the ink was applied.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nQ-switched lasers first became commercially available in the early 1990s. For a couple of decades before that, [[continuous-wave laser]]s were used as medical lasers for tattoo removal. Continuous-wave lasers used a high energy beam that ablated the target area and destroyed surrounding tissue structures as well as tattoo ink. Treatment tended to be painful and cause scarring.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nBefore the development of [[laser]] tattoo removal methods, common techniques included [[dermabrasion]], TCA ([[Trichloroacetic acid]], an [[acid]] that removes the top layers of [[skin]], reaching as deep as the layer in which the tattoo ink resides), salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with [[salt]]), [[cryosurgery]] and [[:wikt:excision|excision]] which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos.<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/><ref name=\"Cannarozzo\">{{cite journal |last1=Cannarozzo |first1=Giovanni |last2=Duca |first2=Ester Del |last3=Cannizzaro |first3=Maria Vittoria |title=Laser tattoo removal: results and issues |journal=PMFA News |date=2017 |volume=4 |issue=6 |url=https://www.thepmfajournal.com/features/post/laser-tattoo-removal-results-and-issues |accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> Many other methods for removing tattoos have been suggested historically including the injection or application of [[tannic acid]], [[lemon juice]], [[garlic]] and [[pigeon]] dung.<ref name=\"Mao\">{{Cite book|last1=Mao |first1=Johnny C. |last2=DeJoseph |first2=Louis M. |title=Latest Innovations for Tattoo and Permanent Makeup Removal |journal=Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America |date=May 2012 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125\u2013134 |doi=10.1016/j.fsc.2012.02.009 |pmid=22537781 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ett3agCGaxsC&pg=PA126|isbn=978-1455745142 }}</ref><ref name=\"Arellano\">{{cite journal |last1=Arellano |first1=CR |last2=Leopold |first2=DA |last3=Shafiroff |first3=BB |title=Tattoo removal: comparative study of six methods in the pig |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |date=December 1982 |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=699\u2013703 |pmid=7146152 |doi=10.1097/00006534-198212000-00007}}</ref>\n\nRecent research is investigating the potential of multi-pass treatments and the use of picosecond laser technology, which seem promising.<ref name=\"Goh\">{{cite journal |last1=Goh |first1=CheeLeok |last2=Ho |first2=StephanieGY |title=Laser tattoo removal: A clinical update |journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery |date=2015 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201315 |doi=10.4103/0974-2077.155066 |pmid=25949017 |pmc=4411606 }}</ref><ref name=\"Kossida\">{{cite journal |last1=Kossida |first1=Theodora |last2=Rigopoulos |first2=Dimitrios |last3=Katsambas |first3=Andreas |last4=Anderson |first4=R.

Dermal [[macrophages]] are part of the immune system, tasked with collecting and digesting cellular debris. In the case of tattoo pigments, macrophages collect ink pigments, but have difficulty breaking them down.  Instead, they store the ink pigments. If a macrophage is damaged, it releases its captive ink, which is taken up by other macrophages. This can make it particularly difficult to remove tattoos. When treatments break down ink particles into smaller pieces, macrophages can more easily remove them.<ref name=\"Wilhelm\">{{cite news |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Menaka |title=Tattoo You: Immune System Cells Help Keep Ink In Its Place |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/08/591315450/tattoo-you-immune-system-cells-help-keep-ink-in-its-place |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=NPR |date=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra. A tattoo laser must be capable of emitting adequate [[energy]] within the given [[absorption spectrum]] of the [[pigment]] to provide an effective treatment. Certain tattoo pigments, such as yellows and fluorescent inks are more challenging to treat than darker blacks and blues, because they have absorption spectra that fall outside or on the edge of the emission spectra available in the tattoo removal laser.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> Recent pastel coloured inks contain high concentrations of [[titanium dioxide]] which is highly reflective.

To mitigate pain the preferred method is simply to cool the area before and during treatment with a medical-grade chiller/cooler and to use a [[topical anesthetic]]. During the treatment process, the laser beam passes through the skin, targeting the ink resting in a liquid state within. While it is possible to see immediate results, in most cases the fading occurs gradually over the 7\u20138 week healing period between treatments.<ref>Kirby W, Holmes E, Desai A, Desai T.

Laser treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos. Semin Cutan Med Surg. 2000 Dec;19(4):239.</ref>  While normal human growth and healing processes will remove small foreign particles from the skin, tattoo pigment particles are too big to be removed automatically. Laser treatment causes tattoo pigment particles to heat up and fragment into smaller pieces.  These smaller pieces are then removed by normal body processes. Q-switched lasers  produce bursts of infrared light at specific frequencies that target a particular spectrum of color in the tattoo ink. The laser passes through the upper layers of the skin to target a specific pigment in the lower layers.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nLaser tattoo removal is a successful application of the theory of selective [[photothermolysis]] (SPTL).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RR | last2 = Parrish | first2 = JA | date = Apr 1983 | title = Selective photothermolysis: precise microsurgery by selective absorption of pulsed radiation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4596| pages = 524\u20137 | doi=10.1126/science.6836297| pmid = 6836297 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..524A }}</ref>  However, unlike treatments for blood vessels or hair the mechanism required to shatter tattoo particles uses the [[photomechanical effect]]. In this situation the energy is absorbed by the ink particles in a very short time, typically nanoseconds. The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment. Hence tissues are largely unaffected since they simply vibrate as the shock wave passes. For laser tattoo removal the selective destruction of tattoo pigments depends on four factors:\n* The color of the light must penetrate sufficiently deep into the skin to reach the tattoo pigment. Pigments deeper in the skin are harder to remove than those near the surface.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The color of the laser light must be more highly absorbed by the tattoo pigment than the surrounding skin.  Different tattoo pigments therefore require different laser colors.  For example, red light is highly absorbed by green tattoo pigments, while yellow tends not to absorb light.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The time duration (pulse duration) of the laser energy must be very short, so that the tattoo pigment is heated to fragmentation temperature before its heat can dissipate to the surrounding skin.  Otherwise, heating of the surrounding tissue can cause burns or scars.  For laser tattoo removal, this duration should be on the order of nanoseconds.\n* Sufficient energy must be delivered during each laser pulse to heat the pigment to fragmentation.  If the energy is too low, pigment will not fragment and no removal will take place.\n\nQ-switched lasers are the only commercially available devices that can meet these requirements.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kilmer SL.

Different lasers are better for different tattoo colors. Consequently, multi-color tattoo removal almost always requires the use of two or more laser wavelengths. Tattoo removal lasers are usually identified by the lasing medium used to create the wavelength (measured in nanometers (nm)):\n* Q-switched Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG: 532&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a green light which is highly absorbed by red, yellow, and orange targets. Useful primarily for red and orange tattoo pigments, this wavelength is also highly absorbed by melanin (the chemical which gives skin color or tan) which makes the laser wavelength effective for age spot or sun spot removal. Nd:YAG lasers may cause hemoglobin absorption, leading to [[purpura]] (collection of blood under tissue in large areas), [[pinpoint bleeding]], or whitening of the skin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beyer|first1=Victor|title=Laser Parameters Within Tattoo Removal|url=http://rethinktheinklasertattooremoval.com/laser-parameters-within-tattoo-removal/|publisher=Rethink the Ink|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n* Q-switched Ruby: 694&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments.  Because it is more highly absorbed by melanin this laser may produce undesirable side effects such as pigmentary changes for patients of all but white skin.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kilmer | first1 = SL | last2 = Anderson | first2 = RR | date = Apr 1993 | title = Clinical use of the Q-switched ruby and the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm and 532 nm) lasers for treatment of tattoos | url = | journal = J Dermatol Surg Oncol | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 330\u20138 | doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.1993.tb00354.x| pmid = 8478472 }}</ref> This is the best wavelength for blue ink.\n* Q-switched Alexandrite: 755&nbsp;nm. The weakest of all the q-switched devices and somewhat similar to the Ruby laser in that the Alexandrite creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments. However, the alexandrite laser color is slightly less absorbed by melanin, so this laser has a slightly lower incidence of unwanted pigmentary changes than a ruby laser.<ref>Alster TS. Q-switched alexandrite laser treatment (755 nm) of professional and amateur tattoos. ''J Am Acad Dermatol''. 1995 Jul;33(1):69\u201373.</ref> This laser works well on green tattoos but because of its weaker peak power it works only moderately well on black and blue ink. It does not work at all (or very minimally) on red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. This laser wavelength is also available in a picosecond speed with anecdotal claims that it removes ink faster.\n* Q-switched Nd:YAG: 1064&nbsp;nm.  This laser creates a near-infrared light (invisible to humans) which is poorly absorbed by [[melanin]], making this the only laser suitable for darker skin. This laser wavelength is also absorbed by all dark tattoo pigments and is the safest wavelength to use on the tissue due to the low melanin absorption and low [[hemoglobin]] absorption.  This is the wavelength of choice for tattoo removal in darker skin types and for black ink.\n* Dye modules are available for some lasers to convert 532&nbsp;nm to 650&nbsp;nm or 585&nbsp;nm light which allows one laser system to safely and effectively treat multi-color tattoo inks. When dye modules take 532&nbsp;nm laser wavelength and change it, there is a loss of energy. Treatments with dye packs, while effective for the first few treatments, many not be able to clear these ink colors fully.  The role of [[dye lasers]] in tattoo removal is discussed in detail in the literature.<ref>[[F. J.

All Q-switched lasers have appropriate pulse durations for tattoo removal.\n\nSpot size, or the width of the laser beam, affects treatment. Light is optically scattered in the skin, like automobile headlights in fog. Larger spot sizes slightly increase the effective penetration depth of the laser light, thus enabling more effective targeting of deeper tattoo pigments. Larger spot sizes also help make treatments faster.\n\nFluence or energy density is another important consideration. Fluence is measured in joules per square centimeter (J/cm\u00b2). It is important to be treated at high enough settings to fragment tattoo particles.\n\nRepetition rate helps make treatments faster but is not associated with any treatment effect. Faster treatments are usually preferred because the pain ends sooner.\n\n===Number of laser tattoo removal treatment sessions needed===\nComplete laser tattoo removal requires numerous treatment sessions, typically spaced at least seven weeks apart.  Treating more frequently than seven weeks increases the risk of adverse effects and does not necessarily increase the rate of ink absorption. Anecdotal reports of treatments sessions at four weeks leads to more scarring and dischromia and can be a source of liability for clinicians. At each session, some but not all of the tattoo pigment particles are effectively fragmented, and the body removes the smallest fragments over the course of several weeks or months.  The result is that the tattoo is lightened over time.  Remaining large particles of tattoo pigment are then targeted at subsequent treatment sessions, causing further lightening. The number of sessions and spacing between treatments depends on various parameters, including the area of the body treated, skin color and effectiveness of the immune system.  Tattoos located on the extremities, such as the ankle, generally take longest. As tattoos fade clinicians may recommend that patients wait many months between treatments to facilitate ink resolution and minimize unwanted side effects.\n\nThe amount of time required for the removal of a tattoo and the success of the removal varies with each individual and their immune system function. Factors influencing this include: skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, layers of ink, immune system function and circulation. Factors under the individual's control are more time between treatments, nutrition, stress, sleep, exercise and fluid levels. In the past health care providers would simply guess on the number of treatments a patient needed which was rather frustrating to patients. A predictive scale, the \"Kirby-Desai Scale\",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jitchotvisut |first1=Janaki |title=9 questions you've always had about tattoo removal, answered |url=https://www.insider.com/everything-you-should-know-about-tattoo-removal-2019-7 |website=Insider |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> was developed by Dr. [[Will Kirby]] and Dr. Alpesh Desai, dermatologists with specialization in tattoo removal techniques, to assess the potential success and number of treatments necessary for laser tattoo removal, provided the medical practitioner is using a Q-switched Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) laser incorporating selective photothermolysis with six weeks between treatments.<ref name=\"KD\">{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=William|last2=Desai|first2=Alpesh|last3=Desai|first3=Tejas|last4=Kartono|first4=Francisca|last5=Geeta|first5=Patel|title=The Kirby-Desai Scale|journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=21 December 2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=32\u201337|pmc=2923953|issn=1941-2789|pmid=20729941}}</ref>\n\nThe Kirby-Desai Scale assigns numerical values to six parameters:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirby |first1=William |title=The Kirby-Desai Scale A Proposed Scale to Assess Tattoo-removal Treatments |journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=32\u201337 |pmc=2923953 |year=2009 |pmid=20729941 }}</ref> skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, and layering. Parameter scores are then added to yield a combined score that will show the estimated number of treatments needed for successful tattoo removal. Experts recommend that the Kirby-Desai scale be used by all laser practitioners prior to starting tattoo removal treatment to help determine the number of treatments required for tattoo removal and as a predictor of the success of the laser tattoo removal treatments.<ref name=\"KD\" /> Prior to 2009, clinicians had no scientific basis by which to estimate the number of treatments needed to remove a tattoo and the use of this scale is now standard practice in laser tattoo removal.\n\nCertain colors have proved more difficult to remove than others. In particular, this occurs when treated with the wrong wavelength of laser light is used. Some have postulated that the reason for slow resolution of green ink in particular is due to its significantly smaller molecular size relative to the other colours.<ref>Konstadinos Siomos; Raymond T. Bailey; Frank R. Cruickshank; Michael J. Murphy; Q-switched laser removal of tattoos: a clinical and spectroscopic investigation of the mechanism. Proc. SPIE 2623, Medical Applications of Lasers III, 40 (Jan 1996); {{DOI|10.1117/12.230314}}</ref> Consequently, green ink tattoos may require treatment with 755&nbsp;nm light but may also respond to 694&nbsp;nm, 650&nbsp;nm and 1064&nbsp;nm. Multiple wavelengths of light may be needed to remove colored inks.\n\nOne small Greek study showed that the R20 method\u2014four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart\u2014caused more breaking up of the ink than the conventional method without more scarring or adverse effects. However, this study was performed on a very small patient population (12 patients total), using the weakest of the QS lasers, the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite laser. One of the other main problems with this study was the fact that more than half of the 18 tattoos removed were not professional and amateur tattoos are always easier to remove. Proof of concept studies are underway, but many laser experts advise against the R20 method using the more modern and powerful tattoo removal lasers available at most offices as an increase in adverse side effects including scarring and dischromia is likely. Patients should inquire about the laser being used if the R20 treatment method is offered by a facility as it is usually only offered by clinics that are using the weak 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite as opposed to the more powerful and versatile devices that are more commonly used. Moreover, dermatologists offering the R20 method should inform patients that it just one alternative to proven protocols and is not a gold standard treatment method to remove tattoos.\n\nMultiple pass treatment methods (R20, as mentioned above, and R0) have generally shown to carry a greater risk of side effects, due to the increased amount of energy used in treatment. One caveat to this, however, is incorporating a perfluorodecalin (PFD) patch into the protocol<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/lsm.22399 | volume=47 | title=Rapid, high-fluence multi-pass q-switched laser treatment of tattoos with a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch: A pilot study | year=2015 | journal=Lasers in Surgery and Medicine | pages=613\u2013618 | last1 = Biesman | first1 = Brian S. | last2 = O'Neil | first2 = Michael P. | last3 = Costner | first3 = Cara}}</ref>. A PFD patch utilizes a clear silicone gel patch, with a small amount of PFD liquid applied to the treatment area immediately before each pass of laser application, and conducting the passes in rapid succession. The combination of the patch and liquid reduce the epidermal scatter, which can limit the predicted side effects typically seen in aggressive laser tattoo removal treatments (hyper and hypopigmentation, blistering, etc)<ref>https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/f/Tattoo_Publication_040919.pdf</ref>. Additionally, the liquid reduces the laser frosting very quickly, allowing for faster re-treatment, limiting the time of treatment while still improving efficacy. Early studies have been performed to indicate improved clearance with the use of this patch in 3-4 passes, in a single session, utilizing more energy than typically allowable with a traditional treatment methodology<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/lsm.22106 | volume=45 | title=Topical perfluorodecalin resolves immediate whitening reactions and allows rapid effective multiple pass treatment of tattoos | year=2013 | journal=Lasers in Surgery and Medicine | pages=76\u201380 | last1 = Reddy | first1 = Kavitha K. | last2 = Brauer | first2 = Jeremy A. | last3 = Anolik | first3 = Robert | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = Leonard | last5 = Brightman | first5 = Lori | last6 = Hale | first6 = Elizabeth | last7 = Karen | first7 = Julie | last8 = Weiss | first8 = Elliot | last9 = Geronemus | first9 = Roy G.}}</ref>. All these physical properties of the patch work to substantially reduce the total number of laser treatment required for ink clearance. While the PFD patch is currently FDA cleared for use with all pico and nanosecond domain lasers and wavelengths, it is only cleared for Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-III. Early studies have shown anecdotally that there isn't necessarily increased risks with Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV-VI, though still not FDA cleared as an indication<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/lsm.23022 | volume=51 | title=Perfluorodecalin-infused patch in picosecond and Q-switched laser-assisted tattoo removal: Safety in Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types | year=2019 | journal=Lasers in Surgery and Medicine | pages=23\u201326 | last1 = Vangipuram | first1 = Ramya | last2 = Hamill | first2 = Selina S. | last3 = Friedman | first3 = Paul M.}}</ref>.\n\n===Factors contributing to the success of laser tattoo removal===\nThere are a number of factors that determine how many treatments will be needed and the level of success one might experience. Age of tattoo, ink density, color and even where the tattoo is located on the body, all play an important role in how many treatments will be needed for complete removal. However, a rarely recognized factor of tattoo removal is the role of the client\u2019s immune response.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Costandi |first1=Mo |title=Tats Off: Targeting the Immune System May Lead to Better Tattoo Removal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tats-off-targeting-the-immune-system-may-lead-to-better-tattoo-removal/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> The normal process of tattoo removal is fragmentation followed by [[phagocytosis]] which is then drained away via the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatics]]. Consequently, it is the inflammation resulting from the actual laser treatment and the natural stimulation of the hosts\u2019 immune response that ultimately results in removal of tattoo ink; thus variations in results are enormous.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Dustin|title=Factors Determining Tattoo Removal Success|url=http://www.falleninktattooremoval.com/2017/02/08/factors-determining-tattoo-removal-success/|publisher=Fallen Ink Tattoo Removal|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pain management during treatment===\nLaser tattoo removal is uncomfortable - many patients say it is worse than getting the tattoo. The pain is often described to be similar to that of hot oil on the skin, or a \"snap\" from an elastic band.  Depending on the patient's [[pain threshold]], and while some patients may forgo anesthesia  altogether, most patients will require some form of local anesthesia. Pre-treatment might include the application of an anesthetic cream under occlusion for 45 to 90 minutes or cooling by ice or cold air prior to the laser treatment session. A better method is complete anesthesia which can be administered locally by injections of 1% to 2% lidocaine with epinephrine.\n\nA technique which helps to reduce the pain sensation felt by patients has been described by MJ Murphy<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Michael J. | year = 2014 | title = A novel, simple and efficacious technique for tattoo removal resulting in less pain using the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser | journal = Lasers in Medical Science | volume = 29| issue = 4| pages = 1445\u20131447| doi=10.1007/s10103-014-1542-3| pmid = 24584904 }}</ref> He used a standard microscope glass slide pressed against the tattooed skin and fired the laser through the glass. This technique may represent a simplest and effective method to reduce the pain sensation when treating small tattoos.\n\n===Post-treatment considerations===\nImmediately after laser treatment, a slightly elevated, white discoloration with or without the presence of punctuate bleeding is often observed. This white color change is thought to be the result of rapid, heat-formed steam or gas, causing dermal and epidermal vacuolization.  Pinpoint bleeding represents vascular injury from photoacoustic waves created by the laser's interaction with tattoo pigment. Minimal edema and [[erythema]] of adjacent normal skin usually resolve within 24 hours. Subsequently, a crust appears over the entire tattoo, which sloughs off at approximately two weeks post-treatment. As noted above, some tattoo pigment may be found within this crust. Post-operative wound care consists of simple wound care and a non-occlusive dressing. Since the application of laser light is sterile there is no need for topical antibiotics. Moreover, topical antibiotic ointments can cause allergic reactions and should be avoided. Fading of the tattoo will be noted over the next eight weeks and re-treatment energy levels can be tailored depending on the clinical response observed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Kirby, William; Desai, Alpesh; Desai, Tejas; Kartona, Francisa.  Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 2, Skin and Aging, October, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Side effects and complications===\nAbout half of the patients treated with Q-switched lasers for tattoo removal will show some transient changes in the normal skin pigmentation. These changes usually resolve in 6 to 12 months but may rarely be permanent.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\">{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Koriakos, Angie|author3=Desai, Alpesh|author4=Desai, Tejas|title=Undesired Pigmentary Alterations Associated with Q-Switched Laser Tattoo Removal|journal=Skin and Aging|date=August 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928125102/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-09-28}}</ref>\n\nHyperpigmentation is related to the patient's [[skin tone]], with skin types IV, V and VI more prone regardless of the wavelength used. Twice daily treatment with hydroquinones and broad-spectrum sunscreens usually resolves the hyperpigmentation within a few months, although, in some patients, resolution can be prolonged.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\"/>\n\nHypopigmentation is more commonly observed in darker skin tones. It is more likely to occur with higher fluence and more frequent treatments. Sometimes lighter skin exhibits hypopigmentation after a series of treatments. Allowing more time between treatments reduces chances of hypopigmentation. Since it is more likely to see hypopigmentation after multiple treatments, some practitioners suggest waiting a few additional weeks, after a few sessions. Usually treatment stops until hypopigmentation resolves in a matter of months.\n\nTransient textural changes are occasionally noted but often resolve within a few months; however, permanent textural changes and scarring very rarely occur. If a patient is prone to pigmentary or textural changes, longer treatment intervals are recommended. Additionally, if a blister or crust forms following treatment, it is imperative that the patient does not manipulate this secondary skin change. Early removal of a blister of crust increases the chances of developing a scar. Additionally, patients with a history of hypertrophic or keloidal scarring need to be warned of their increased risk of scarring.\n\nLocal allergic responses to many tattoo pigments have been reported, and allergic reactions to tattoo pigment after Q-switched laser treatment are also possible.  Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide is used to \"brighten\" the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur.  The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (mercuric sulphide).   Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined to the site of the red/yellow ink.  Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response. Oral antihistamines and anti-inflammatory steroids have been used to treat allergic reactions to tattoo ink.\n\nStudies of various tattoo pigments have shown that a number of pigments (most containing iron oxide or titanium dioxide) change color when irradiated with Q-switched laser energy. Some tattoo colors including flesh tones, light red, white, peach and light brown containing pigments as well as some green and blue tattoo pigments, changed to black when irradiated with Q-switched laser pulses. The resulting gray-black color may require more treatments to remove. If tattoo darkening does occur, after 8 weeks the newly darkened tattoo can be treated as if it were black pigment.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Kaur, Ravneet Ruby|author3=Desai, Alpesh|title=Paradoxical darkening and removal of pink tattoo ink|journal=Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology|date=June 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928101437/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nVery rarely, non Q-switched laser treatments, like CO2 or Argon lasers, which are very rarely offered these days, can rupture blood vessels and aerosolize tissue requiring a plastic shield or a cone device to protect the laser operator from tissue and blood contact. Protective eyewear may be worn if the laser operator chooses to do so.\n\nWith the mechanical or salabrasion method of tattoo removal, the incidence of scarring, pigmentary alteration (hyper- and hypopigmentation), and ink retention are extremely high.<ref>Kirby, William, Desai, Alpesh, Desai, Tejas, Kartona, Francisa, Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 1, Skin and Aging, September, 2005</ref>\n\nThe use of Q-switched lasers could very rarely produce the development of large [[bulla (dermatology)|bulla]].  However, if  patients follow post care directions to elevate, rest, and apply intermittent icing, it should minimize the chances of bulla and other adverse effects. In addition, health care practitioners should contemplate the use of a cooling device during the tattoo removal procedure. While  the infrequent bulla development is a possible side effect of Q-switched laser tattoo removal, if treated appropriately and quickly by the health care practitioner, it is unlikely that long term consequences would ensue.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby W|author2=Kartono F|author3=Desai A|author4=Kaur R|author5=Desai T|title=Treatment of Large Bulla Formation after Tattoo Removal with a Q-Switched Laser|journal=Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=January 2010|url=http://www.jcadonline.com/2210/treatment-of-large-bulla-formation-after-tattoo-removal-with-a-q-switched-laser/#more-2210}}</ref>\n\n===Risks===\nAlthough laser treatment is well known and often used to remove tattoos, unwanted side effects of laser tattoo removal include the possibility of discoloration of the skin such as hypopigmentation (white spots, more common in darker skin) and hyperpigmentation (dark spots) as well as textural changes - these changes are usually not permanent when the Nd:YAG is used but it is much more likely with the use of the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite, the 694&nbsp;nm Ruby and the R20 method. Very rarely, burns may result in scarring but this usually only occurs when patients do not care for the treated area properly.  Occasionally, \"paradoxical darkening\" of a tattoo may occur, when a treated tattoo becomes darker instead of lighter.  This occurs most often with white ink, flesh tones, pink, and cosmetic make-up tattoos.<ref>S. Varma, et al. Tattoo ink darkening of a yellow tattoo after Q-switched laser treatment.

This has not yet been reported in vivo but has been shown in laboratory tests. Laser removal of traumatic tattoos may similarly be complicated depending on the substance of the pigmenting material. In one reported instance, the use of a laser resulted in the ignition of embedded particles of firework debris.<ref>Taylor Charles R., \"Laser ignition of traumatically embedded firework debris,\" ''Lasers in Surgery and Medicine'', 1998, volume 22, p. 157\u2013158</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = E.

While [[tattoo]]s are generally considered permanent, it is now possible to remove them with treatments, fully or partially.\n\nThe \"standard modality for tattoo removal\"<ref name=\"Sardana\"/> is the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigments using [[Q-switched lasers]]. Different types of Q-switched lasers are used to target different colors of tattoo ink depending on the specific light absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments. \nTypically, black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely using Q-switched lasers while lighter colors such as yellows and greens are still very difficult to remove. Success can depend on a wide variety of factors including skin color, ink color, and the depth at which the ink was applied.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nQ-switched lasers first became commercially available in the early 1990s. For a couple of decades before that, [[continuous-wave laser]]s were used as medical lasers for tattoo removal.

Dermal [[macrophages]] are part of the immune system, tasked with collecting and digesting cellular debris. In the case of tattoo pigments, macrophages collect ink pigments, but have difficulty breaking them down.  Instead, they store the ink pigments. If a macrophage is damaged, it releases its captive ink, which is taken up by other macrophages. This can make it particularly difficult to remove tattoos. When treatments break down ink particles into smaller pieces, macrophages can more easily remove them.<ref name=\"Wilhelm\">{{cite news |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Menaka |title=Tattoo You: Immune System Cells Help Keep Ink In Its Place |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/08/591315450/tattoo-you-immune-system-cells-help-keep-ink-in-its-place |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=NPR |date=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra.

Laser treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos. Semin Cutan Med Surg. 2000 Dec;19(4):239.</ref>  While normal human growth and healing processes will remove small foreign particles from the skin, tattoo pigment particles are too big to be removed automatically. Laser treatment causes tattoo pigment particles to heat up and fragment into smaller pieces.  These smaller pieces are then removed by normal body processes. Q-switched lasers  produce bursts of infrared light at specific frequencies that target a particular spectrum of color in the tattoo ink. The laser passes through the upper layers of the skin to target a specific pigment in the lower layers.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nLaser tattoo removal is a successful application of the theory of selective [[photothermolysis]] (SPTL).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RR | last2 = Parrish | first2 = JA | date = Apr 1983 | title = Selective photothermolysis: precise microsurgery by selective absorption of pulsed radiation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4596| pages = 524\u20137 | doi=10.1126/science.6836297| pmid = 6836297 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..524A }}</ref>  However, unlike treatments for blood vessels or hair the mechanism required to shatter tattoo particles uses the [[photomechanical effect]]. In this situation the energy is absorbed by the ink particles in a very short time, typically nanoseconds. The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment. Hence tissues are largely unaffected since they simply vibrate as the shock wave passes. For laser tattoo removal the selective destruction of tattoo pigments depends on four factors:\n* The color of the light must penetrate sufficiently deep into the skin to reach the tattoo pigment. Pigments deeper in the skin are harder to remove than those near the surface.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The color of the laser light must be more highly absorbed by the tattoo pigment than the surrounding skin.  Different tattoo pigments therefore require different laser colors.  For example, red light is highly absorbed by green tattoo pigments, while yellow tends not to absorb light.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The time duration (pulse duration) of the laser energy must be very short, so that the tattoo pigment is heated to fragmentation temperature before its heat can dissipate to the surrounding skin.  Otherwise, heating of the surrounding tissue can cause burns or scars.  For laser tattoo removal, this duration should be on the order of nanoseconds.\n* Sufficient energy must be delivered during each laser pulse to heat the pigment to fragmentation.  If the energy is too low, pigment will not fragment and no removal will take place.\n\nQ-switched lasers are the only commercially available devices that can meet these requirements.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kilmer SL.

Different lasers are better for different tattoo colors. Consequently, multi-color tattoo removal almost always requires the use of two or more laser wavelengths. Tattoo removal lasers are usually identified by the lasing medium used to create the wavelength (measured in nanometers (nm)):\n* Q-switched Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG: 532&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a green light which is highly absorbed by red, yellow, and orange targets. Useful primarily for red and orange tattoo pigments, this wavelength is also highly absorbed by melanin (the chemical which gives skin color or tan) which makes the laser wavelength effective for age spot or sun spot removal. Nd:YAG lasers may cause hemoglobin absorption, leading to [[purpura]] (collection of blood under tissue in large areas), [[pinpoint bleeding]], or whitening of the skin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beyer|first1=Victor|title=Laser Parameters Within Tattoo Removal|url=http://rethinktheinklasertattooremoval.com/laser-parameters-within-tattoo-removal/|publisher=Rethink the Ink|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n* Q-switched Ruby: 694&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments.  Because it is more highly absorbed by melanin this laser may produce undesirable side effects such as pigmentary changes for patients of all but white skin.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kilmer | first1 = SL | last2 = Anderson | first2 = RR | date = Apr 1993 | title = Clinical use of the Q-switched ruby and the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm and 532 nm) lasers for treatment of tattoos | url = | journal = J Dermatol Surg Oncol | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 330\u20138 | doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.1993.tb00354.x| pmid = 8478472 }}</ref> This is the best wavelength for blue ink.\n* Q-switched Alexandrite: 755&nbsp;nm. The weakest of all the q-switched devices and somewhat similar to the Ruby laser in that the Alexandrite creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments. However, the alexandrite laser color is slightly less absorbed by melanin, so this laser has a slightly lower incidence of unwanted pigmentary changes than a ruby laser.<ref>Alster TS. Q-switched alexandrite laser treatment (755 nm) of professional and amateur tattoos. ''J Am Acad Dermatol''. 1995 Jul;33(1):69\u201373.</ref> This laser works well on green tattoos but because of its weaker peak power it works only moderately well on black and blue ink. It does not work at all (or very minimally) on red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. This laser wavelength is also available in a picosecond speed with anecdotal claims that it removes ink faster.\n* Q-switched Nd:YAG: 1064&nbsp;nm.  This laser creates a near-infrared light (invisible to humans) which is poorly absorbed by [[melanin]], making this the only laser suitable for darker skin. This laser wavelength is also absorbed by all dark tattoo pigments and is the safest wavelength to use on the tissue due to the low melanin absorption and low [[hemoglobin]] absorption.  This is the wavelength of choice for tattoo removal in darker skin types and for black ink.\n* Dye modules are available for some lasers to convert 532&nbsp;nm to 650&nbsp;nm or 585&nbsp;nm light which allows one laser system to safely and effectively treat multi-color tattoo inks. When dye modules take 532&nbsp;nm laser wavelength and change it, there is a loss of energy. Treatments with dye packs, while effective for the first few treatments, many not be able to clear these ink colors fully.  The role of [[dye lasers]] in tattoo removal is discussed in detail in the literature.<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]] (ed.), ''Tunable Laser Applications'' (CRC, New York, 2009) Chapter 8.</ref>\n\nPulsewidth or pulse duration is a critical laser parameter. All Q-switched lasers have appropriate pulse durations for tattoo removal.\n\nSpot size, or the width of the laser beam, affects treatment. Light is optically scattered in the skin, like automobile headlights in fog. Larger spot sizes slightly increase the effective penetration depth of the laser light, thus enabling more effective targeting of deeper tattoo pigments. Larger spot sizes also help make treatments faster.\n\nFluence or energy density is another important consideration. Fluence is measured in joules per square centimeter (J/cm\u00b2). It is important to be treated at high enough settings to fragment tattoo particles.\n\nRepetition rate helps make treatments faster but is not associated with any treatment effect. Faster treatments are usually preferred because the pain ends sooner.\n\n===Number of laser tattoo removal treatment sessions needed===\nComplete laser tattoo removal requires numerous treatment sessions, typically spaced at least seven weeks apart.  Treating more frequently than seven weeks increases the risk of adverse effects and does not necessarily increase the rate of ink absorption. Anecdotal reports of treatments sessions at four weeks leads to more scarring and dischromia and can be a source of liability for clinicians. At each session, some but not all of the tattoo pigment particles are effectively fragmented, and the body removes the smallest fragments over the course of several weeks or months.  The result is that the tattoo is lightened over time.  Remaining large particles of tattoo pigment are then targeted at subsequent treatment sessions, causing further lightening. The number of sessions and spacing between treatments depends on various parameters, including the area of the body treated, skin color and effectiveness of the immune system.  Tattoos located on the extremities, such as the ankle, generally take longest. As tattoos fade clinicians may recommend that patients wait many months between treatments to facilitate ink resolution and minimize unwanted side effects.\n\nThe amount of time required for the removal of a tattoo and the success of the removal varies with each individual and their immune system function. Factors influencing this include: skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, layers of ink, immune system function and circulation. Factors under the individual's control are more time between treatments, nutrition, stress, sleep, exercise and fluid levels. In the past health care providers would simply guess on the number of treatments a patient needed which was rather frustrating to patients. A predictive scale, the \"Kirby-Desai Scale\",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jitchotvisut |first1=Janaki |title=9 questions you've always had about tattoo removal, answered |url=https://www.insider.com/everything-you-should-know-about-tattoo-removal-2019-7 |website=Insider |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> was developed by Dr. [[Will Kirby]] and Dr. Alpesh Desai, dermatologists with specialization in tattoo removal techniques, to assess the potential success and number of treatments necessary for laser tattoo removal, provided the medical practitioner is using a Q-switched Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) laser incorporating selective photothermolysis with six weeks between treatments.<ref name=\"KD\">{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=William|last2=Desai|first2=Alpesh|last3=Desai|first3=Tejas|last4=Kartono|first4=Francisca|last5=Geeta|first5=Patel|title=The Kirby-Desai Scale|journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=21 December 2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=32\u201337|pmc=2923953|issn=1941-2789|pmid=20729941}}</ref>\n\nThe Kirby-Desai Scale assigns numerical values to six parameters:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirby |first1=William |title=The Kirby-Desai Scale A Proposed Scale to Assess Tattoo-removal Treatments |journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=32\u201337 |pmc=2923953 |year=2009 |pmid=20729941 }}</ref> skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, and layering. Parameter scores are then added to yield a combined score that will show the estimated number of treatments needed for successful tattoo removal. Experts recommend that the Kirby-Desai scale be used by all laser practitioners prior to starting tattoo removal treatment to help determine the number of treatments required for tattoo removal and as a predictor of the success of the laser tattoo removal treatments.<ref name=\"KD\" /> Prior to 2009, clinicians had no scientific basis by which to estimate the number of treatments needed to remove a tattoo and the use of this scale is now standard practice in laser tattoo removal.\n\nCertain colors have proved more difficult to remove than others. In particular, this occurs when treated with the wrong wavelength of laser light is used. Some have postulated that the reason for slow resolution of green ink in particular is due to its significantly smaller molecular size relative to the other colours.<ref>Konstadinos Siomos; Raymond T. Bailey; Frank R. Cruickshank; Michael J. Murphy; Q-switched laser removal of tattoos: a clinical and spectroscopic investigation of the mechanism. Proc. SPIE 2623, Medical Applications of Lasers III, 40 (Jan 1996); {{DOI|10.1117/12.230314}}</ref> Consequently, green ink tattoos may require treatment with 755&nbsp;nm light but may also respond to 694&nbsp;nm, 650&nbsp;nm and 1064&nbsp;nm. Multiple wavelengths of light may be needed to remove colored inks.\n\nOne small Greek study showed that the R20 method\u2014four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart\u2014caused more breaking up of the ink than the conventional method without more scarring or adverse effects. However, this study was performed on a very small patient population (12 patients total), using the weakest of the QS lasers, the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite laser. One of the other main problems with this study was the fact that more than half of the 18 tattoos removed were not professional and amateur tattoos are always easier to remove. Proof of concept studies are underway, but many laser experts advise against the R20 method using the more modern and powerful tattoo removal lasers available at most offices as an increase in adverse side effects including scarring and dischromia is likely. Patients should inquire about the laser being used if the R20 treatment method is offered by a facility as it is usually only offered by clinics that are using the weak 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite as opposed to the more powerful and versatile devices that are more commonly used. Moreover, dermatologists offering the R20 method should inform patients that it just one alternative to proven protocols and is not a gold standard treatment method to remove tattoos.\n\nMultiple pass treatment methods (R20, as mentioned above, and R0) have generally shown to carry a greater risk of side effects, due to the increased amount of energy used in treatment. One caveat to this, however, is incorporating a perfluorodecalin (PFD) patch into the protocol<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lsm.22399</ref>. A PFD patch utilizes a clear silicone gel patch, with a small amount of PFD liquid applied to the treatment area immediately before each pass of laser application, and conducting the passes in rapid succession. The combination of the patch and liquid reduce the epidermal scatter, which can limit the predicted side effects typically seen in aggressive laser tattoo removal treatments (hyper and hypopigmentation, blistering, etc)<ref>https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/f/Tattoo_Publication_040919.pdf</ref>. Additionally, the liquid reduces the laser frosting very quickly, allowing for faster re-treatment, limiting the time of treatment while still improving efficacy. Early studies have been performed to indicate improved clearance with the use of this patch in 3-4 passes, in a single session, utilizing more energy than typically allowable with a traditional treatment methodology<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lsm.22106</ref>. All these physical properties of the patch work to substantially reduce the total number of laser treatment required for ink clearance. While the PFD patch is currently FDA cleared for use with all pico and nanosecond domain lasers and wavelengths, it is only cleared for Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-III. Early studies have shown anecdotally that there isn't necessarily increased risks with Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV-VI, though still not FDA cleared as an indication<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lsm.23022</ref>.\n\n===Factors contributing to the success of laser tattoo removal===\nThere are a number of factors that determine how many treatments will be needed and the level of success one might experience. Age of tattoo, ink density, color and even where the tattoo is located on the body, all play an important role in how many treatments will be needed for complete removal. However, a rarely recognized factor of tattoo removal is the role of the client\u2019s immune response.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Costandi |first1=Mo |title=Tats Off: Targeting the Immune System May Lead to Better Tattoo Removal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tats-off-targeting-the-immune-system-may-lead-to-better-tattoo-removal/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> The normal process of tattoo removal is fragmentation followed by [[phagocytosis]] which is then drained away via the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatics]]. Consequently, it is the inflammation resulting from the actual laser treatment and the natural stimulation of the hosts\u2019 immune response that ultimately results in removal of tattoo ink; thus variations in results are enormous.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Dustin|title=Factors Determining Tattoo Removal Success|url=http://www.falleninktattooremoval.com/2017/02/08/factors-determining-tattoo-removal-success/|publisher=Fallen Ink Tattoo Removal|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pain management during treatment===\nLaser tattoo removal is uncomfortable - many patients say it is worse than getting the tattoo. The pain is often described to be similar to that of hot oil on the skin, or a \"snap\" from an elastic band.  Depending on the patient's [[pain threshold]], and while some patients may forgo anesthesia  altogether, most patients will require some form of local anesthesia. Pre-treatment might include the application of an anesthetic cream under occlusion for 45 to 90 minutes or cooling by ice or cold air prior to the laser treatment session. A better method is complete anesthesia which can be administered locally by injections of 1% to 2% lidocaine with epinephrine.\n\nA technique which helps to reduce the pain sensation felt by patients has been described by MJ Murphy<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Michael J. | year = 2014 | title = A novel, simple and efficacious technique for tattoo removal resulting in less pain using the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser | journal = Lasers in Medical Science | volume = 29| issue = 4| pages = 1445\u20131447| doi=10.1007/s10103-014-1542-3| pmid = 24584904 }}</ref> He used a standard microscope glass slide pressed against the tattooed skin and fired the laser through the glass. This technique may represent a simplest and effective method to reduce the pain sensation when treating small tattoos.\n\n===Post-treatment considerations===\nImmediately after laser treatment, a slightly elevated, white discoloration with or without the presence of punctuate bleeding is often observed. This white color change is thought to be the result of rapid, heat-formed steam or gas, causing dermal and epidermal vacuolization.  Pinpoint bleeding represents vascular injury from photoacoustic waves created by the laser's interaction with tattoo pigment. Minimal edema and [[erythema]] of adjacent normal skin usually resolve within 24 hours. Subsequently, a crust appears over the entire tattoo, which sloughs off at approximately two weeks post-treatment. As noted above, some tattoo pigment may be found within this crust. Post-operative wound care consists of simple wound care and a non-occlusive dressing. Since the application of laser light is sterile there is no need for topical antibiotics. Moreover, topical antibiotic ointments can cause allergic reactions and should be avoided. Fading of the tattoo will be noted over the next eight weeks and re-treatment energy levels can be tailored depending on the clinical response observed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Kirby, William; Desai, Alpesh; Desai, Tejas; Kartona, Francisa.  Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 2, Skin and Aging, October, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Side effects and complications===\nAbout half of the patients treated with Q-switched lasers for tattoo removal will show some transient changes in the normal skin pigmentation. These changes usually resolve in 6 to 12 months but may rarely be permanent.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\">{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Koriakos, Angie|author3=Desai, Alpesh|author4=Desai, Tejas|title=Undesired Pigmentary Alterations Associated with Q-Switched Laser Tattoo Removal|journal=Skin and Aging|date=August 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928125102/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-09-28}}</ref>\n\nHyperpigmentation is related to the patient's [[skin tone]], with skin types IV, V and VI more prone regardless of the wavelength used. Twice daily treatment with hydroquinones and broad-spectrum sunscreens usually resolves the hyperpigmentation within a few months, although, in some patients, resolution can be prolonged.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\"/>\n\nHypopigmentation is more commonly observed in darker skin tones. It is more likely to occur with higher fluence and more frequent treatments. Sometimes lighter skin exhibits hypopigmentation after a series of treatments. Allowing more time between treatments reduces chances of hypopigmentation. Since it is more likely to see hypopigmentation after multiple treatments, some practitioners suggest waiting a few additional weeks, after a few sessions. Usually treatment stops until hypopigmentation resolves in a matter of months.\n\nTransient textural changes are occasionally noted but often resolve within a few months; however, permanent textural changes and scarring very rarely occur. If a patient is prone to pigmentary or textural changes, longer treatment intervals are recommended. Additionally, if a blister or crust forms following treatment, it is imperative that the patient does not manipulate this secondary skin change. Early removal of a blister of crust increases the chances of developing a scar. Additionally, patients with a history of hypertrophic or keloidal scarring need to be warned of their increased risk of scarring.\n\nLocal allergic responses to many tattoo pigments have been reported, and allergic reactions to tattoo pigment after Q-switched laser treatment are also possible.  Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide is used to \"brighten\" the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur.  The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (mercuric sulphide).   Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined to the site of the red/yellow ink.  Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response. Oral antihistamines and anti-inflammatory steroids have been used to treat allergic reactions to tattoo ink.\n\nStudies of various tattoo pigments have shown that a number of pigments (most containing iron oxide or titanium dioxide) change color when irradiated with Q-switched laser energy. Some tattoo colors including flesh tones, light red, white, peach and light brown containing pigments as well as some green and blue tattoo pigments, changed to black when irradiated with Q-switched laser pulses. The resulting gray-black color may require more treatments to remove. If tattoo darkening does occur, after 8 weeks the newly darkened tattoo can be treated as if it were black pigment.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Kaur, Ravneet Ruby|author3=Desai, Alpesh|title=Paradoxical darkening and removal of pink tattoo ink|journal=Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology|date=June 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928101437/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nVery rarely, non Q-switched laser treatments, like CO2 or Argon lasers, which are very rarely offered these days, can rupture blood vessels and aerosolize tissue requiring a plastic shield or a cone device to protect the laser operator from tissue and blood contact. Protective eyewear may be worn if the laser operator chooses to do so.\n\nWith the mechanical or salabrasion method of tattoo removal, the incidence of scarring, pigmentary alteration (hyper- and hypopigmentation), and ink retention are extremely high.<ref>Kirby, William, Desai, Alpesh, Desai, Tejas, Kartona, Francisa, Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 1, Skin and Aging, September, 2005</ref>\n\nThe use of Q-switched lasers could very rarely produce the development of large [[bulla (dermatology)|bulla]].  However, if  patients follow post care directions to elevate, rest, and apply intermittent icing, it should minimize the chances of bulla and other adverse effects. In addition, health care practitioners should contemplate the use of a cooling device during the tattoo removal procedure. While  the infrequent bulla development is a possible side effect of Q-switched laser tattoo removal, if treated appropriately and quickly by the health care practitioner, it is unlikely that long term consequences would ensue.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby W|author2=Kartono F|author3=Desai A|author4=Kaur R|author5=Desai T|title=Treatment of Large Bulla Formation after Tattoo Removal with a Q-Switched Laser|journal=Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=January 2010|url=http://www.jcadonline.com/2210/treatment-of-large-bulla-formation-after-tattoo-removal-with-a-q-switched-laser/#more-2210}}</ref>\n\n===Risks===\nAlthough laser treatment is well known and often used to remove tattoos, unwanted side effects of laser tattoo removal include the possibility of discoloration of the skin such as hypopigmentation (white spots, more common in darker skin) and hyperpigmentation (dark spots) as well as textural changes - these changes are usually not permanent when the Nd:YAG is used but it is much more likely with the use of the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite, the 694&nbsp;nm Ruby and the R20 method. Very rarely, burns may result in scarring but this usually only occurs when patients do not care for the treated area properly.  Occasionally, \"paradoxical darkening\" of a tattoo may occur, when a treated tattoo becomes darker instead of lighter.  This occurs most often with white ink, flesh tones, pink, and cosmetic make-up tattoos.<ref>S. Varma, et al. Tattoo ink darkening of a yellow tattoo after Q-switched laser treatment.

This has not yet been reported in vivo but has been shown in laboratory tests. Laser removal of traumatic tattoos may similarly be complicated depending on the substance of the pigmenting material. In one reported instance, the use of a laser resulted in the ignition of embedded particles of firework debris.<ref>Taylor Charles R., \"Laser ignition of traumatically embedded firework debris,\" ''Lasers in Surgery and Medicine'', 1998, volume 22, p. 157\u2013158</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = E.
