Only two species have been truly [[domesticated]]: ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' and ''[[Apis cerana indica]]''. ''A. mellifera'' has been cultivated at least since the time of the building of the [[Egyptian pyramid]]s, and only that species has been moved extensively beyond its native range.\n\nHoney bees are the only extant members of the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] Apini.

Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:\n#Eggs are laid singly in a cell in a wax [[honeycomb]], produced and shaped by the worker bees. Using her [[spermatheca]], the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on which cell she is laying it into. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]]. Larvae are initially fed with [[royal jelly]] produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and [[pupate|pupating]].\n#Young worker bees, sometimes called \"nurse bees\", clean the hive and feed the larvae. When their royal jelly-producing glands begin to atrophy, they begin building comb cells. They progress to other within-colony tasks as they become older, such as receiving nectar and pollen from foragers, and guarding the hive. Later still, a worker takes her first orientation flights and finally leaves the hive and typically spends the remainder of her life as a forager.\n#Worker bees cooperate to find food and use a pattern of \"dancing\" (known as the [[bee dance]] or waggle dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of ''Apis'' exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources are very close to the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the \"round dance\".\n#Honey bees also perform [[tremble dance]]s, which recruit receiver bees to collect nectar from returning foragers.\n#Virgin queens go on mating flights away from their home colony to a drone congregation area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die in the act of mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.\n#Colonies are established not by solitary queens, as in most bees, but by groups known as \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarm]]s\", which consist of a mated queen and a large contingent of worker bees. This group moves ''en masse'' to a nest site which was scouted by worker bees beforehand and whose location is communicated with a special type of dance. Once the swarm arrives, they immediately construct a new wax comb and begin to raise new worker brood. This type of nest founding is not seen in any other living bee genus, though several groups of [[vespid]] wasps also found new nests by swarming (sometimes including multiple queens). Also, [[stingless bee]]s will start new nests with large numbers of worker bees, but the nest is constructed before a queen is escorted to the site, and this worker force is not a true \"swarm\".\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern 39.jpg|Honey bee eggs shown in opened wax cells\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|Eggs and larvae\nFile:Drohnenpuppen 79b.jpg|Drone pupae\nFile:Birth of black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera).jpg|Emergence of a European dark honey bee (''A. m. mellifera'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Winter survival===\nIn cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about {{convert|10|C|F}} and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a \"winter cluster\".

As such, they can provide some pollination to many plants, especially non-native crops, but most native plants have some native pollinator that is far more effective at pollinating that species.<ref>[https://www.decodedscience.org/plants-pollinators-and-the-price-of-almonds/28797/2 Plants, Pollinators, and the Price of Almonds]<br/>\"Flowers set more seeds when visited by wild insects, and the more plants that were visited by wild insects, the more likely they were to set fruit. In some places the researchers considered, wild insects were pollinating most of the plants despite rented honey bees being present.\"</ref> When honey bees are present as an invasive species in an area, they compete for flowers with native pollinators, which can actually push out the native species.<ref>[https://www.popsci.com/honeybees-hog-limelight Saving pollinators is about more than just honeybees]<br/>The problem is that there are only so many flowers and places to nest. And once the numbers of honeybees have been artificially inflated (commercial-scale beekeeping wouldn\u2019t exist without humans) the increased competition for these resources can push native non-''Apis'' pollinators out of their natural habitats. Honeybees also spread exotic plants and transmit pathogens, both of which have been shown to harm other pollinators.</ref>\n\n===Claims of human dependency===\n\n[[Western honey bee]]s are often described as being essential to all human food production, leading to claims that without their pollination, all of humanity would starve, or even die out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/news/world/humans-need-bees-to-survive/755737|title=If All The Bees In The World Die, Humans Will Not Survive|website=Elite Daily}}</ref><ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-world-without-honeybees-2013-6#if-bees-dies-beekeepers-who-make-their-living-by-managing-bee-colonies-will-go-out-of-business-1 A Devastating Look At Our World If Honeybees Disappeared]<br/>\"A world without honeybees would also mean a world without fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\"</ref> Einstein is sometimes misquoted as saying ''If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.''<ref>[https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ezaq/what-would-happen-if-all-the-bees-died-tomorrow What Would Happen if All the Bees Went Extinct?]<br/>\"First, the easy part: \"I've never seen anything definitively link the quote to Einstein,\" says Mark Dykes, the chief inspector for Texas Apiary Inspection Service.

In Japan, where ''mellifera'' is vulnerable to local hornets and disease, the Japanese honey bee ''[[a. cerana japonica]]'' is used in its place. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating and allowing the beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed beekeeper, and favoring large-scale commercial operations. Bees of various types other than honey bees are also domesticated and used for pollination or other means around the world, including ''[[Tetragonula iridipennis]]'' in India, the [[blue orchard bee]] for tree nut and fruit pollination in the United States, and a number of species of ''[[Bombus]]'' (bumblebees) for pollination in various regions globally, such as [[tomato]]es, which are not effectively pollinated by honey bees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biobestgroup.com/en/biobest/pollination/things-to-know-about-bumblebees-7052/species-6674/|title=Bumblebee species &#124; Biobest|website=www.biobestgroup.com}}</ref>\n\n===Colony collapse disorder===\n{{Main|Colony collapse disorder}}\n\nPrimarily in places where the bee was imported by humans, periodic collapses in honey bee populations have occurred at least since the late 19th century.<ref>[https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1915&context=honr_theses Colony Collapse Disorder: The Vanishing Honeybee (Apis Mellifera)]<br/>However, as humans continued to manipulate the honeybee and deliberately transferred them on a global scale, diseases simultaneously spread and harmed managed colonies.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother would increase. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>Barron, A., Oldroyd, B, and Ratnieks, F.L.W.

The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other [[Hymenoptera]]) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees.\n\nThe sting apparatus, including the barbs, may have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of ''Apis cerana japonica'', defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. [[Asian giant hornet]]) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level (\"balling\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2001/Thawley/defense.htm |title=Heat tolerance as a weapon |author=C.

But in many landscapes, or when an orchard stops blooming, farmed honeybees can compete with wild bees for food, making it harder for wild species to survive.\u201d</ref>\n\nMost flowering plants depend on specialized pollinators to efficiently fertilize them. [[Cucurbitaceae|Cucurbits]], for example, are pollinated by [[squash bee]]s that specifically visit the early-blooming male flowers before sunrise, when honey bees are inactive, and then return to pollinate the female flowers later in the day. Such [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] also mean that the specialized pollinator will be covered mainly in its host's specific pollen. \n\nUnfortunately, the very generalized nature of the honey bee's nectar-gathering activities, potentially visiting dozens of different species in a single day, means that a flower visited by a honey bee will often get very little pollen from its own species. This diminished pollination can reduce the plant's ability to produce seeds, especially when the honey bees are squeezing out the native pollinators for a species, a problem occurring all over the United States because of honey bees and other invasive species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/bee-battles-why-our-native-pollinators-are-losing-the-war-40620|title=Bee battles: why our native pollinators are losing the war|first=Kelsey K.|last=Graham|website=The Conversation}}</ref><ref>[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189268 Do managed bees have negative effects on wild bees?: A systematic review of the literature]<br/>Our review found that the majority of studies reach the conclusion that managed bees negatively affect, or have the potential to negatively affect, wild bees through competition, changes in plant communities, or transmission of pathogens.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidescience.org/news/how-bees-you-know-are-killing-bees-you-don%E2%80%99t|title=How the Bees You Know are Killing the Bees You Don't|date=January 19, 2017|website=Inside Science}}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n{{Main|Bee learning and communication}}\nHoney bees are known to communicate through many different chemicals and odors, as is common in insects.

Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:\n#Eggs are laid singly in a cell in a wax [[honeycomb]], produced and shaped by the worker bees. Using her [[spermatheca]], the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on which cell she is laying it into. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]]. Larvae are initially fed with [[royal jelly]] produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and [[pupate|pupating]].\n#Young worker bees, sometimes called \"nurse bees\", clean the hive and feed the larvae. When their royal jelly-producing glands begin to atrophy, they begin building comb cells. They progress to other within-colony tasks as they become older, such as receiving nectar and pollen from foragers, and guarding the hive. Later still, a worker takes her first orientation flights and finally leaves the hive and typically spends the remainder of her life as a forager.\n#Worker bees cooperate to find food and use a pattern of \"dancing\" (known as the [[bee dance]] or waggle dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of ''Apis'' exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources are very close to the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the \"round dance\".\n#Honey bees also perform [[tremble dance]]s, which recruit receiver bees to collect nectar from returning foragers.\n#Virgin queens go on mating flights away from their home colony to a drone congregation area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die in the act of mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.\n#Colonies are established not by solitary queens, as in most bees, but by groups known as \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarm]]s\", which consist of a mated queen and a large contingent of worker bees. This group moves ''en masse'' to a nest site which was scouted by worker bees beforehand and whose location is communicated with a special type of dance. Once the swarm arrives, they immediately construct a new wax comb and begin to raise new worker brood. This type of nest founding is not seen in any other living bee genus, though several groups of [[vespid]] wasps also found new nests by swarming (sometimes including multiple queens). Also, [[stingless bee]]s will start new nests with large numbers of worker bees, but the nest is constructed before a queen is escorted to the site, and this worker force is not a true \"swarm\".\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern 39.jpg|Honey bee eggs shown in opened wax cells\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|Eggs and larvae\nFile:Drohnenpuppen 79b.jpg|Drone pupae\nFile:Birth of black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera).jpg|Emergence of a European dark honey bee (''A. m. mellifera'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Winter survival===\nIn cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about {{convert|10|C|F}} and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a \"winter cluster\".

The scale of these pollination services is commonly measured in the billions of dollars, credited with adding about 9% to the value of crops across the world. However, despite contributing substantially to crop pollination, there is debate about the potential spillover to natural landscapes and competition between managed honey bees and many of the ~20,000 species of wild pollinators.<ref name=\"GeldmannGonz\u00e1lez-Varo2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Geldmann |first1=Jonas |last2=Gonz\u00e1lez-Varo|first2=Juan P. |title=Conserving honey bees does not help wildlife |journal=Science |volume=359 |issue=6374 |year=2018 |pages=392\u2013393 |doi=10.1126/science.aar2269|pmid=29371456 }}</ref>\n\nSpecies of ''Apis'' are generalist floral visitors, and pollinate many species of flowering plants, but because of their \"generalized\" nature, they do so inefficiently. Without specialized adaptations for specific flowers, their ability to reach pollen and nectar is often limited. What's more, their tendency to visit all species in a given area means that the pollen they carry for any one species is often very diluted. As such, they can provide some pollination to many plants, especially non-native crops, but most native plants have some native pollinator that is far more effective at pollinating that species.<ref>[https://www.decodedscience.org/plants-pollinators-and-the-price-of-almonds/28797/2 Plants, Pollinators, and the Price of Almonds]<br/>\"Flowers set more seeds when visited by wild insects, and the more plants that were visited by wild insects, the more likely they were to set fruit. In some places the researchers considered, wild insects were pollinating most of the plants despite rented honey bees being present.\"</ref> When honey bees are present as an invasive species in an area, they compete for flowers with native pollinators, which can actually push out the native species.<ref>[https://www.popsci.com/honeybees-hog-limelight Saving pollinators is about more than just honeybees]<br/>The problem is that there are only so many flowers and places to nest. And once the numbers of honeybees have been artificially inflated (commercial-scale beekeeping wouldn\u2019t exist without humans) the increased competition for these resources can push native non-''Apis'' pollinators out of their natural habitats. Honeybees also spread exotic plants and transmit pathogens, both of which have been shown to harm other pollinators.</ref>\n\n===Claims of human dependency===\n\n[[Western honey bee]]s are often described as being essential to all human food production, leading to claims that without their pollination, all of humanity would starve, or even die out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/news/world/humans-need-bees-to-survive/755737|title=If All The Bees In The World Die, Humans Will Not Survive|website=Elite Daily}}</ref><ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-world-without-honeybees-2013-6#if-bees-dies-beekeepers-who-make-their-living-by-managing-bee-colonies-will-go-out-of-business-1 A Devastating Look At Our World If Honeybees Disappeared]<br/>\"A world without honeybees would also mean a world without fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\"</ref> Einstein is sometimes misquoted as saying ''If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.''<ref>[https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ezaq/what-would-happen-if-all-the-bees-died-tomorrow What Would Happen if All the Bees Went Extinct?]<br/>\"First, the easy part: \"I've never seen anything definitively link the quote to Einstein,\" says Mark Dykes, the chief inspector for Texas Apiary Inspection Service.

[[Rice]], [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], and [[maize]] are all [[wind pollination|wind-pollinated]], as with all other grasses.\n\nSimilarly, no crops originating in the New World depend on the domesticated honey bee ''Apis mellifera'' at all, as the insect is invasive, having been brought over with colonists in the last few centuries. \n[[Tomato]]es, [[Capsicum annuum|pepper]]s, [[Cucurbita|squash]], and all other New World crops evolved with native pollinators like [[squash bee]]s, [[bumble bee]]s, and other native bees. The [[stingless bee]]s mentioned by Jefferson are distant relatives of the honey bees, in the genus ''[[Melipona]]''.\n\n==Nutrition==\n\nHoney bees obtain all of their nutritional requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar.

In Japan, where ''mellifera'' is vulnerable to local hornets and disease, the Japanese honey bee ''[[a. cerana japonica]]'' is used in its place. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating and allowing the beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed beekeeper, and favoring large-scale commercial operations. Bees of various types other than honey bees are also domesticated and used for pollination or other means around the world, including ''[[Tetragonula iridipennis]]'' in India, the [[blue orchard bee]] for tree nut and fruit pollination in the United States, and a number of species of ''[[Bombus]]'' (bumblebees) for pollination in various regions globally, such as [[tomato]]es, which are not effectively pollinated by honey bees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biobestgroup.com/en/biobest/pollination/things-to-know-about-bumblebees-7052/species-6674/|title=Bumblebee species &#124; Biobest|website=www.biobestgroup.com}}</ref>\n\n===Colony collapse disorder===\n{{Main|Colony collapse disorder}}\n\nPrimarily in places where the bee was imported by humans, periodic collapses in honey bee populations have occurred at least since the late 19th century.<ref>[https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1915&context=honr_theses Colony Collapse Disorder: The Vanishing Honeybee (Apis Mellifera)]<br/>However, as humans continued to manipulate the honeybee and deliberately transferred them on a global scale, diseases simultaneously spread and harmed managed colonies.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother would increase. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>Barron, A., Oldroyd, B, and Ratnieks, F.L.W.

Workers would be related by three-quarters of their genes, and the difference in [[Coefficient of relationship|relationship]] between sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease. The benefit of policing is negated, and policing is less favored.

The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other [[Hymenoptera]]) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees.\n\nThe sting apparatus, including the barbs, may have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of ''Apis cerana japonica'', defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. [[Asian giant hornet]]) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level (\"balling\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2001/Thawley/defense.htm |title=Heat tolerance as a weapon |author=C.

[[Cucurbitaceae|Cucurbits]], for example, are pollinated by [[squash bee]]s that specifically visit the early-blooming male flowers before sunrise, when honey bees are inactive, and then return to pollinate the female flowers later in the day. Such [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] also mean that the specialized pollinator will be covered mainly in its host's specific pollen. \n\nUnfortunately, the very generalized nature of the honey bee's nectar-gathering activities, potentially visiting dozens of different species in a single day, means that a flower visited by a honey bee will often get very little pollen from its own species.

The dance language is also used during the process of reproductive fission, or swarming, when scouts communicate the location and quality of nesting sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/honey-bee-dance-language|title=The Honey Bee Dance Language|last=Tarpy|first=David|date=2016|website=NC State Extension|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe details of the signalling being used vary from species to species; for example, the two smallest species, ''[[Apis andreniformis]]'' and ''A. florea'', dance on the upper surface of the comb, which is horizontal (not vertical, as in other species), and worker bees orient the dance in the actual compass direction of the resource to which they are recruiting.\n\n''[[Apis mellifera carnica]]'' honey bees use their antennae asymmetrically for social interactions with a strong lateral preference to use their right antennae.<ref name=sr2045>{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Lesley J.|author2=Elisa Rigosi |author3=Elisa Frasnelli |author4=Giorgio Vallortigara|authorlink4=Giorgio Vallortigara |title=A right antenna for social behaviour in honeybees|journal=Scientific Reports|date=27 June 2013|issue=|pages=2045|doi=10.1038/srep02045|pmid=23807465|pmc=3694496|volume=3|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E2045R}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/351355/description/Honeybees_use_right_antennae_to_tell_friend_from_foe|title=Honeybees use right antennae to tell friend from foe|author=Jessica Shugart|work=Science News|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere has been speculation as to honey bee [[consciousness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/science/honeybees-insects-consciousness-brains.html|title=Do Honeybees Feel?
