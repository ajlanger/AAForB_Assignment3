Promoted as \"the world\u2019s longest art gallery\", the canyon is known for its extensive [[rock art]], most of it created by the [[Fremont culture]] and the [[Ute tribe|Ute]] people. The rock art, shelters, and [[granary|granaries]] left behind by the Fremont make Ninemile Canyon a destination for [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and tourists alike.\n\nThe canyon became a main [[transport corridor]] in the region during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of [[ranch]]es in Ninemile Canyon, and even a short-lived town named [[Harper, Utah|Harper]]. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of [[natural gas]] deep beneath the West Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002.

An array of natural gas wells is visible in the distance, May 2019.]]\n\nNinemile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the [[Book Cliffs]], and south and east of [[Ashley National Forest]]. The full {{convert|78|mi|adj=on}} canyon route, formerly [[Utah State Route 53 (1931-1969)|SR&#8209;53]] through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of [[Wellington, Utah|Wellington]] and [[Myton, Utah|Myton]]. Nine Mile Creek, the [[stream]] that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. Nine Mile Creek is actually a minor [[tributary]] of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], emptying into [[Desolation Canyon]] on the east. A number of tributary canyons branch off Ninemile Cayon itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, [[Minnie Maud]], and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:HuntSceneNMC.JPG|thumb|left|The famous ''Cottonwood Panel'', also called ''The Great Hunt'', May 2006]]\n\nThere are at least an estimated 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, with more than 10,000 individual images.<ref name=spangler/>{{rp|141}} The true figures may be ten times as high,<ref name=dirtraker/> but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in [[North America]].

Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.\n\nThe freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne/>{{rp|81\u201382}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Current issues==\n[[File:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007]]\n\nRock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past. Ninemile Canyon's rock art, however, is still at risk. Carved and painted mainly on weathered [[sandstone]] panels, the images are susceptible to [[erosion]], which is accelerated by touching<ref name=spangler />{{rp|87}} and airborne dust. The dust is a special concern as heavy industrial traffic in the canyon increases.\n\nNine Mile Canyon Road, once such an important route, was almost completely [[pavement (material)|unpaved]] until 2013. In fact, it was considered the poorest of the four old military roads in Duchesne County.<ref name=duchesne />{{rp|71}} In 1990, the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) designated it as a Scenic Backcountry Byway.<ref name=risk/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=&itype=ngpsid|title=Nine Mile Canyon at risk|last=Henetz|first=Patty|date=February 16, 2008|website=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The Ninemile Canyon Paving project is expected to be complete in October 2014 (weather permitting).\n\n===Natural gas development===\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon Compressor Station.jpeg|thumb|left|Bill Barrett Corporation's natural gas compressor station, at the Dry Canyon junction, March 2008]]\n\nNine Mile's unique archaeological resources have led to intense debate over [[land use]]. As in many rural areas of the Western United States, land in the canyon is a patchwork of [[public land|public]] and private property. Archaeological sites are found on both. Commercially important deposits of [[mineral]]s and other geological resources have also been discovered, further complicating the issues. Since 2002, the [[Bill Barrett Corporation]], in cooperation with the BLM and private landowners, has been pursuing a natural gas exploration project on the West Tavaputs Plateau in and around the canyon. The company estimates the available natural gas reserves at approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (2.8{{e|10}} m\u00b3).<ref name=risk/> Bill Barrett Corporation has spent some $2 million on improving area roads, and the complete project, if approved as planned, could create as many as 1000 jobs.<ref name=oversight/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182831/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/content/mobile/700231011/Canyon-oversight-questioned.html?printView=true|title=Canyon oversight questioned {{!}} Deseret News|last=Thalman|first=James|date=2016-03-03|website=[[Deseret News]]|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Government involvement in the project has been controversial, drawing complaints from [[conservation movement|conservation]] groups that not enough is being done to protect natural and cultural resources.<ref name=policy/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/us/when-the-bush-energy-policy-confronts-ancient-art.html|title=When the Bush Energy Policy Confronts Ancient Art|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=2004-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon dust.jpeg|thumb|Road dust drifts up the canyon, March 2008.]]\n[[File:Dustypetroglyphs.jpeg|thumb|Dust-covered petroglyphs,<br>March 2008]]\nPrevious to 2013, industrial truck traffic on Nine Mile's main road were producing clouds of dust. Prior to paving, the dirt road was not maintained for heavy traffic.<ref name=risk/> The dust reduced visibility on the road and settled on the rock art. Carbon County, which supervises the use of the road, approved the application of [[magnesium chloride]] on the road as a [[dust abatement]] measure.

Groesbeck August 19, 1867\".<ref name=spangler />{{rp|62}} [[John Wesley Powell]]'s second [[Colorado River]] expedition camped at the mouth of the canyon in 1871, and the earliest appearance of the name ''Nine Mile Canyon'' is in records of the expedition.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|15}}\n\nNine Mile Canyon Road (also 9 Mile Canyon Road) was constructed through the canyon in 1886 by the [[Buffalo Soldiers]] of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], linking [[Fort Duchesne]] to the railroad through the city of [[Price, Utah|Price]]. Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.\n\nThe freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne/>{{rp|81\u201382}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Current issues==\n[[File:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007]]\n\nRock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past. Ninemile Canyon's rock art, however, is still at risk. Carved and painted mainly on weathered [[sandstone]] panels, the images are susceptible to [[erosion]], which is accelerated by touching<ref name=spangler />{{rp|87}} and airborne dust. The dust is a special concern as heavy industrial traffic in the canyon increases.\n\nNine Mile Canyon Road, once such an important route, was almost completely [[pavement (material)|unpaved]] until 2013. In fact, it was considered the poorest of the four old military roads in Duchesne County.<ref name=duchesne />{{rp|71}} In 1990, the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) designated it as a Scenic Backcountry Byway.<ref name=risk/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=&itype=ngpsid|title=Nine Mile Canyon at risk|last=Henetz|first=Patty|date=February 16, 2008|website=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The Ninemile Canyon Paving project is expected to be complete in October 2014 (weather permitting).\n\n===Natural gas development===\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon Compressor Station.jpeg|thumb|left|Bill Barrett Corporation's natural gas compressor station, at the Dry Canyon junction, March 2008]]\n\nNine Mile's unique archaeological resources have led to intense debate over [[land use]]. As in many rural areas of the Western United States, land in the canyon is a patchwork of [[public land|public]] and private property. Archaeological sites are found on both. Commercially important deposits of [[mineral]]s and other geological resources have also been discovered, further complicating the issues. Since 2002, the [[Bill Barrett Corporation]], in cooperation with the BLM and private landowners, has been pursuing a natural gas exploration project on the West Tavaputs Plateau in and around the canyon. The company estimates the available natural gas reserves at approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (2.8{{e|10}} m\u00b3).<ref name=risk/> Bill Barrett Corporation has spent some $2 million on improving area roads, and the complete project, if approved as planned, could create as many as 1000 jobs.<ref name=oversight/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182831/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/content/mobile/700231011/Canyon-oversight-questioned.html?printView=true|title=Canyon oversight questioned {{!}} Deseret News|last=Thalman|first=James|date=2016-03-03|website=[[Deseret News]]|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Government involvement in the project has been controversial, drawing complaints from [[conservation movement|conservation]] groups that not enough is being done to protect natural and cultural resources.<ref name=policy/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/us/when-the-bush-energy-policy-confronts-ancient-art.html|title=When the Bush Energy Policy Confronts Ancient Art|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=2004-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon dust.jpeg|thumb|Road dust drifts up the canyon, March 2008.]]\n[[File:Dustypetroglyphs.jpeg|thumb|Dust-covered petroglyphs,<br>March 2008]]\nPrevious to 2013, industrial truck traffic on Nine Mile's main road were producing clouds of dust. Prior to paving, the dirt road was not maintained for heavy traffic.<ref name=risk/> The dust reduced visibility on the road and settled on the rock art. Carbon County, which supervises the use of the road, approved the application of [[magnesium chloride]] on the road as a [[dust abatement]] measure. The compound pulled moisture from the air to dampen dust, but it may have done more harm than good<ref name=dust/> as the magnesium chloride dust may have drifted on to the rock walls.<ref name=risk/> A 2007 study, commissioned by the BLM and paid for by Bill Barrett Corporation,<ref name=oversight/> found that the dust that lands on a rock art panel created \"a very serious conservation problem.\"
