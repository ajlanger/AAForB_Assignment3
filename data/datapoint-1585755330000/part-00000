According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Acadians that returned from exile discovered several thousand immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands.

Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]].

The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas.

Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.
