The earliest symptoms may include a [[failure to thrive]] and a localized [[scleroderma]]-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent usually around 18\u201324 months. Limited growth, full-body [[alopecia]] (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.<ref name=NORD2014/> Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, [[atherosclerosis]], kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and [[cardiovascular]] problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The head is usually large in relation to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development.\n\n==Cause==\nProgeria is caused by mutations that weaken the structure of the cell nucleus, making normal cell division difficult. The histone mark [[H4K20me3]] is involved in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome  caused by de novo mutations that occurs in a gene that encodes [[lamin A]]. Lamin A is made but isn't processed properly. This poor processing creates an abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized [[heterochromatin]]. Patients also don't have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability.<ref name=\"aging\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000357206 |pmid=24603298 |title=Epigenetic Involvement in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome: A Mini-Review |journal=Gerontology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013203 |year=2014 |last1=Arancio |first1=Walter |last2=Pizzolanti |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Genovese |first3=Swonild I. |last4=Pitrone |first4=Maria |last5=Giordano |first5=Carla }}</ref>\n\nIn normal conditions, the ''[[LMNA]]'' gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A, which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A.<ref name=ghr>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMNA LMNA] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/BrowseGenes Genes] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]</ref> Prelamiln A contains a \u201cCAAX\u201dwhere C is a cysteine, an aliphatic amino acid, and X any amino acid. This motif at the [[Carboxyl-terminal|carboxyl-termini]] of proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications. First, protein [[farnesyltransferase]] catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine. Second, an endoprotease that recognizes the farnesylated protein catalyzes cleavage of the peptide bond between the cysteine and -aaX. In the third step, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesylcysteine. The [[Farnesylation|farnesylated]] and methylated protein is [[Protein transport|transported]] through a [[nuclear pore]] to the [[Nucleoplasm|interior of the nucleus]]. Once in the nucleus, the protein is [[Proteolysis|cleaved]] by a [[protease]] called zinc metallopeptidase STE24 ([[ZMPSTE24]]), which removes the last 15 amino acids, which includes the farnesylated cysteine. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as [[lamin A]]. In most mammalian cells, lamin A, along with lamin B1, lamin B2 and lamin C, makes up the [[nuclear lamina]], which provides structural support to the nucleus.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a [[point mutation]] in position 1824 of the ''LMNA'' gene, which replaces a cytosine with thymine.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = De Sandre-Giovannoli | first1 = A. | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R. | last3 = Cau | first3 = P. | last4 = Navarro | first4 = C. | last5 = Amiel | first5 = J. | last6 = Boccaccio | first6 = I. | last7 = Lyonnet | first7 = S. | last8 = Stewart | first8 = CL. | last9 = Munnich | first9 = A. | last10 = Le Merrer | first10 = M. | last11 = L\u00e9vy | first11 = N | title = Lamin a truncation in Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5628 | page = 2055 |date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084125 | pmid = 12702809 | display-authors = 8 }}</ref> This mutation creates a 5' [[cryptic splice site]] within [[exon]] 11, resulting in a shorter than normal mRNA transcript.

Progerin's farnesyl group cannot be removed because the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site is lacking from progerin, so the abnormal protein is permanently attached to the nuclear rim.

This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can occur because that attachment takes place and the nucleus is not in a normal state.

The earliest symptoms may include a [[failure to thrive]] and a localized [[scleroderma]]-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent usually around 18\u201324 months. Limited growth, full-body [[alopecia]] (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.<ref name=NORD2014/> Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, [[atherosclerosis]], kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and [[cardiovascular]] problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The head is usually large in relation to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development.\n\n==Cause==\nProgeria is caused by mutations that weaken the structure of the cell nucleus, making normal cell division difficult. The histone mark [[H4K20me3]] is involved in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome  caused by de novo mutations that occurs in a gene that encodes [[lamin A]]. Lamin A is made but isn't processed properly. This poor processing creates an abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized [[heterochromatin]]. Patients also don't have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability.<ref name=\"aging\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000357206 |pmid=24603298 |title=Epigenetic Involvement in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome: A Mini-Review |journal=Gerontology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013203 |year=2014 |last1=Arancio |first1=Walter |last2=Pizzolanti |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Genovese |first3=Swonild I. |last4=Pitrone |first4=Maria |last5=Giordano |first5=Carla }}</ref>\n\nIn normal conditions, the ''[[LMNA]]'' gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A, which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A.<ref name=ghr>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMNA LMNA] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/BrowseGenes Genes] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]</ref> Prelamiln A contains a \u201cCAAX\u201dwhere C is a cysteine, an aliphatic amino acid, and X any amino acid. This motif at the [[Carboxyl-terminal|carboxyl-termini]] of proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications. First, protein [[farnesyltransferase]] catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine. Second, an endoprotease that recognizes the farnesylated protein catalyzes cleavage of the peptide bond between the cysteine and -aaX. In the third step, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesylcysteine. The [[Farnesylation|farnesylated]] and methylated protein is [[Protein transport|transported]] through a [[nuclear pore]] to the [[Nucleoplasm|interior of the nucleus]]. Once in the nucleus, the protein is [[Proteolysis|cleaved]] by a [[protease]] called zinc metallopeptidase STE24 ([[ZMPSTE24]]), which removes the last 15 amino acids, which includes the farnesylated cysteine. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as [[lamin A]]. In most mammalian cells, lamin A, along with lamin B1, lamin B2 and lamin C, makes up the [[nuclear lamina]], which provides structural support to the nucleus.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a [[point mutation]] in position 1824 of the ''LMNA'' gene, which replaces a cytosine with thymine.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = De Sandre-Giovannoli | first1 = A. | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R. | last3 = Cau | first3 = P. | last4 = Navarro | first4 = C. | last5 = Amiel | first5 = J. | last6 = Boccaccio | first6 = I. | last7 = Lyonnet | first7 = S. | last8 = Stewart | first8 = CL. | last9 = Munnich | first9 = A. | last10 = Le Merrer | first10 = M. | last11 = L\u00e9vy | first11 = N | title = Lamin a truncation in Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5628 | page = 2055 |date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084125 | pmid = 12702809 | display-authors = 8 }}</ref> This mutation creates a 5' [[cryptic splice site]] within [[exon]] 11, resulting in a shorter than normal mRNA transcript.

This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can occur because that attachment takes place and the nucleus is not in a normal state.
