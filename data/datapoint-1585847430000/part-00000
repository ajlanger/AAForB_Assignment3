The government's policies generally support the free practice of religion in the country, and it provides funding to religious organizations and anti-discrimination programs on a regular basis. According to [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and the [[Norwegian Police Service|Norwegian police]], religiously motivated hate speech is prevalent, particularly online, and primarily targeting the Muslim and Jewish communities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe origins of the modern Kingdom of Norway can be traced to the kingdoms established by Vikings during the [[Middle Ages]]. During this period, Norwegian kings such as [[Olaf II of Norway]] converted to Christianity, and propagated it within their kingdoms to reify their authority.<ref name=\":1\" /> Accounts from this time period include graphic descriptions of gruesome torture perpetrated against pagans who refused to convert.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Catholic Church in Norway would be replaced by Evangelical-Lutheranism during the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, and non-Protestants were persecuted.''<ref name=\":8\" />'' From the 16th to 19th centuries, Norway (under either a Danish or Swedish crown) forced the [[S\u00e1mi people]] of northeastern Scandinavia to convert to Christianity, suppressing and eventually all but eradicating their indigenous religion.<ref name=\":6\" /> Jews were at times tolerated in Norway, but in 1814 a new constitution banned Jews from the country\u2013\u2013this provision would be reversed in 1851, and by the end of the 19th century Norway would be home to a few thousand Jews.<ref name=\":9\" /> This population was devastated in the 1940s during the German occupation of Norway as part of World War II and [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Toward the end of the 20th century and in the 21st, Norwegian government has adopted some constitutional reforms to recognize the traditions of the S\u00e1mi people,<ref name=\":10\" /> to establish a separation between church and state,<ref name=\":4\" /> and to provide financial restitution for the Jewish community,<ref name=\":11\" /> but it has also imposed religious clothing bans targeting Muslim women.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe [[National Bureau of Statistics (Norway)|National Statistics Bureau]] estimated that in 2017, 71 percent of the population belonged to the [[Church of Norway]], an evangelical Lutheran church. 6.4 percent of the population belong to other Christian denominations, of which the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest, with 2.9 percent of the population. [[Muslims]] comprise 2.9 percent of the population. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], and [[Judaism|Jews]] each make up less than 1 percent of the population. The [[Norwegian Humanist Association]], with a registered membership of around 6 percent of the population, accounts for nearly all those registered with [[Life stance|life-stance]] organizations (nonreligious or philosophical communities with organizational ethics based on humanist values).<ref name=\":0\">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/norway International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Norway],'' US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nImmigrants comprise the majority of members of religious groups outside the Church of Norway. Immigrants from [[Poland]] and the [[Philippines]] have increased the number of Catholics, while those from such countries as [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Somalia]] have increased the size of the Muslim community. Catholics and Muslims generally have greater representation in cities than in rural areas. Muslims are located throughout the country, but the population is concentrated in the [[Oslo]] region. Many recent immigrants from Muslim majority countries still reside in asylum reception centers. According to [[Norwegian Directorate of Immigration]] statistics, approximately 5,600 of the 6,300 persons residing in reception centers as of October 2017 come from Muslim majority countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Norway}}\n=== Unification and Christianization of the Kingdom of Norway (10th c.
