He returned to the court of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] in Madrid in 1606 and helped decorate the recently rebuilt [[Palacio del Pardo]]. While at work his brother died, and Vicente took his place. He painted there a history of Achilles. When finished, he was employed for four years by the monks of the [[Monastery of El Paular|Chartreuse of el Paular]] to decorate their monastery with 54 canvases of historical figures the great cloister. 27 represent the live of St. Bruno, 27 of martyrs.<ref>[http://monasteriopaular.com/Claustro%20con%20cuadros.html Web oficial of the Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de El Paular]</ref><ref>[http://www.museodelprado.es/sala-de-prensa/noticias/noticia/volver/72/actualidad/los-cartujos-de-carducho-regresan-a-el-paular/ Los cartujos de Carducho regresan a El Paular], Museo Nacional del Prado.</ref>\n\nHe worked a great deal for the subsequent monarch, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], and his best pictures are those he executed for him as decorations, now preserved in the [[Prado]]. Examples of his work are preserved at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Segovia]], and several other [[Spain|Spanish]] cities. For many years he labored in Madrid as a teacher of his art, and among his pupils were Juan Ricci, [[Pedro Obregon]], [[Vela (artist)|Vela]], [[Francisco Collantes]], and other distinguished representatives of the Spanish school during the 17th century.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe also authored a treatise, ''De las Excelencias de la Pintura'' or ''Di\u00e1logos de la pintura, su defensa, origen, essencia, definici\u00f3n, modos, y differencias'',{{efn|''Dialogues on painting: its defense, origin, essence, definition, styles, and differences''}} published in 1633.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  Written in classical tradition as a dialogue between a master and an apprentice.  Following strict piety of the Spanish realm, the text urges:\n:<blockquote>\"Shame on me and all those who rash and impudent, and without meditation and without improving our souls, in this world set out to paint a portrait of the most Holy Queen of Angels, Mother of the Almighty, she who was full of grace, she who will be our means for gaining heaven...How well this was understood by that holy monastic painter Brother Juan Fesulano..(who) never started to paint without praying first..and (who) wept whenever he painted Christ on the Cross.\"</blockquote>\n\nCarducho also assailed the verism of practiced by some such as [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], and particularly was critical of [[Caravaggio]] and his followers, on whom he wrote:<ref>Translation for Holt, E.G. by Martin S.

They do not stop to reflect of the fire of his talent which is so forceful, nor whether they are able to digest such an impetuous, unheard of, and incompatible technique, nor whether they possess Caravaggio's nimbleness of painting without preparation. Did anyone ever paint, and with so much success, as this monster of genius and talent, almost without rules, without theory, without learning and meditation, solely by the power of this genius and the model in front of him which he simply copied so admirably.? I heard a zealot of our profession say that the appearance of this man mean a foreboding of ruin and end of painting, and how at the close of this visible world the Antichrist, pretending to be the real Christ with false and strange miracles and monstrous deeds would carry with him to damnation a very large number of people moved by his works which seemed so admirable (although they were in themselves deceptive, false, and without truth or permanence).</blockquote>\n\n:<blockquote>\"Thus this Anti-Michelangelo with his showy and external copying  of nature his admirable technique and liveliness has been able to persuade such a large number of all kinds of people that his is good painting and that his theory and practice are right, that they have turned their backs on the true manner of perpetuating themselves and on true knowledge in this matter.\"</blockquote>\n\nCarducho died in Madrid. \n\nThe largest collection of his Works remain in the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/artist/carducho-vicente/5573f53d-cea9-4d86-9f5f-221ad379970e|title=Carducho, Vicente - The Collection - Museo Nacional del Prado|website=www.museodelprado.es|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>.
