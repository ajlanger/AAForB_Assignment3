He was best known for composing the '''''Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi''''', a work on [[medieval India]], which covers the period from the reign of [[Ghiyas ud din Balban]] to the first six years of reign of [[Firoz Shah Tughluq]] and the ''Fatwa-i-Jahandari'' which promoted a hierarchy among Muslim communities in the [[Indian subcontinent]], even if historian [[M. Athar Ali]] says that it's not on a racialist basis or even like the [[Hindu caste system]], but taking as a model [[Sassanid]] [[Iran]], which promoted an idea of aristocracy though birth and which was \"fully in accordance with the main thrust of Islamic thought as it had developed by that time\", including in the works of his near-contemporary [[Ibn Khaldun]].<ref>M.
