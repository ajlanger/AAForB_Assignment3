Edited by Michael Pittman. G. I. Gurdjieff: Armenian Roots, Global Branches. During the early period after Gurdjieff\u2019s arrival in Europe in 1921 he gained significant notoriety in Europe and the United States... In October of 1922, Gurdjieff set up a school at the Prieur\u00e9 des Basses Loges at Fontainebleau-Avon, outside of Paris. It was at the Prieur\u00e9 that Gurdjieff met many notable figures, authors, and artists of the early twentieth century, many of whom went on to be close students and exponents of his teaching. Over the course of his life, those who visited and worked with him included the French author Ren\u00e9 Daumal; the renowned short story author from New Zealand, [[Katherine Mansfield]]; [[Kathryn Hulme]], later the author of ''[[The Nun's Story|A Nun's Life]]''; [[P. L. Travers]], the author of ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]''; and [[Jean Toomer]], the author of ''[[Cane (novel)|Cane]]'', whose work and influence would figure prominently in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]... Numerous study groups, organizations, formal foundations, and even land-based communities have been initiated in his name, primarily in North and South America and Europe, and to a lesser extent, in Japan, China, India, Australia, and South Africa. In 1979, Peter Brook, the British theater director and author, created a film based on ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''.</ref> Gurdjieff taught that most humans do not possess a unified consciousness and thus live their lives in a state of hypnotic \"waking sleep\", but that it is possible to awaken to a higher state of consciousness and achieve full human potential. Gurdjieff described a method attempting to do so, calling the discipline \"The Work\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P.

Greek-Russian and Greek-Georgian were also very common combinations in Kars Oblast and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the [[Tsarist]] rule.\n</ref> The exact year of his birth remains unknown; conjectures range from 1866 to 1877. Some authors (such as James Moore) argue for 1866. Both Olga de Hartmann, the woman Gurdjieff called \"the first friend of my inner life\", and Louise Goepfert March, Gurdjieff's secretary in the early 1930s, believed that Gurdjieff was born in 1872. A passport gave a birthdate of November 28, 1877, but he once stated that he was born at the stroke of midnight at the beginning of New Year's Day ([[Julian calendar]]). Although the dates of his birth vary, the year of 1872 is inscribed in a plate on the gravemarker in the cemetery of [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne]], France, where his body was buried.<ref>https://www.landrucimetieres.fr/spip/spip.php?article1949</ref>\n\nGurdjieff spent his childhood in [[Kars]], which, from 1878 to 1918, was the administrative capital of the Russian-ruled Transcaucasus province of Kars Oblast, a border region recently captured from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It contained extensive grassy plateau-steppe and high mountains, and was inhabited by a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional population that had a history of respect for travelling mystics and holy men, and for religious [[syncretism]] and [[religious conversion|conversion]]. Both the city of Kars and the surrounding territory were home to an extremely diverse population: although part of the [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian Plateau]], Kars Oblast was home to Armenians, Russians, Caucasus Greeks, Georgians, Turks, Kurds and smaller numbers of Christian communities from eastern and central Europe such as [[Caucasus Germans]], [[Estonians]] and Russian sectarian communities like the [[Molokans]], [[Doukhobors]], ''Pryguny'', and ''[[Subbotniki]]''. Gurdjieff makes particular mention of the [[Yazidi]] community. Growing up in a multi-ethnic society, Gurdjieff became fluent in Armenian, Pontic Greek, Russian and Turkish, speaking the last in a mixture of elegant [[Ottoman Turkish language|Osmanl\u0131]] and some dialect.<ref>John G. Bennett, ''Witness'', Omen press, Arizona 1974 p. 55.</ref> He later acquired \"a working facility with several European languages\".<ref name=\"Challenger\"/> Early influences on him included his father, a carpenter and amateur ''[[ashik]]'' or [[bard]]ic poet,<ref>\n''Meetings with Remarkable Men'', Chapter II. Gurdjieff uses the spelling \"ashok\".</ref> and the priest of the town's [[Cathedral of Kars|Russian church]], [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] Borsh, a family friend. The young Gurdjieff avidly read Russian-language scientific literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookofdaystales.com/tag/spirituality/|title=spirituality \u2013 BOOK OF DAYS TALES|website=www.bookofdaystales.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref> Influenced by these writings, and having witnessed a number of phenomena that he could not explain, he formed the conviction that there existed a hidden truth not to be found in science or in mainstream religion.\n\n===Travels===\nIn early adulthood, according to his own account, Gurdjieff's curiosity led him to travel to [[Central Asia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Tibet]] and [[Rome]] before he returned to [[Russia]] for a few years in 1912. He was never forthcoming about the source of his teachings. The only account of his wanderings appears in his book ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''. Most commentators<ref>J.G.Bennet 'Gurdjieff \u2013 Making a New World'</ref> leave his background unexplained, and it is not generally considered to be a reliable or straightforward autobiography.<ref>S.

G. Bennett]] researched his sources extensively and suggested that these characters were symbolic of the three types of people to whom Gurdjieff referred: No. 1 centred in their physical body; No. 2 centred in their emotions and No. 3 centred in their minds. He asserts that he has encounters with [[dervish]]es, [[fakir]]s and descendants of the extinct [[Essenes]], whose teaching had been, he said, conserved at a monastery in Sarmoung. The book also has an overarching [[quest]] [[narrative]] involving a map of \"pre-sand Egypt\" and culminating in an encounter with the \"[[Sarmoung Brotherhood]]\".<ref name=\"sedgwick\">Mark Sedgwick, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=7cjFFgvUdDUC&pg=PA208 European Neo-Sufi Movements in the Inter-war Period]\" in ''Islam in Inter-War Europe'', ed. by Natalie Clayer and Eric Germain.

In the same year, he married the [[Poles|Polish]] Julia Ostrowska in [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1914, Gurdjieff advertised his ballet, ''The Struggle of the Magicians,'' and he supervised his pupils' writing of the sketch ''Glimpses of Truth.'' In 1915, Gurdjieff accepted [[P. D. Ouspensky]] as a pupil, and in 1916, he accepted the composer [[Thomas de Hartmann]] and his wife, Olga, as students. Then, he had about 30 pupils. Ouspensky already had a reputation as a writer on mystical subjects and had conducted his own, ultimately disappointing, search for wisdom in the East. The Fourth Way \"system\" taught during this period was complex and metaphysical, partly expressed in scientific terminology.\n\nIn the midst of revolutionary upheaval in Russia, Gurdjieff left [[Petrograd]] in 1917 to return to his family home in Alexandropol. During the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], he set up temporary study communities in [[Essentuki]] in the [[Caucasus]], then in [[Tuapse]], [[Maikop]], [[Sochi]] and [[Poti]], all on the [[Black Sea]] coast of southern Russia, where he worked intensively with many of his Russian pupils. Gurdjieff said, \"Begin in Russia, End in Russia\".\n\nIn March 1918, Ouspensky separated from Gurdjieff, settling in England and teaching the Fourth Way in his own right. The two men were to have a very ambivalent relationship for decades to come.\n\nFour months later, Gurdjieff's eldest sister and her family reached him in [[Essentuki]] as refugees, informing him that Turks had shot his father in [[Alexandropol]] on 15 May. As Essentuki became more and more threatened by civil war, Gurdjieff fabricated a newspaper story announcing his forthcoming \"scientific expedition\" to \"Mount Induc\". Posing as a scientist, Gurdjieff left Essentuki with fourteen companions (excluding Gurdjieff's family and Ouspensky). They travelled by train to Maikop, where hostilities delayed them for three weeks. In spring 1919, Gurdjieff met the artist Alexandre de Salzmann and his wife Jeanne and accepted them as pupils. Assisted by Jeanne de Salzmann, Gurdjieff gave the first public demonstration of his [[Gurdjieff movements|Sacred Dances]] (Movements at the [[Tbilisi]] Opera House, 22 June).\n\n===In Georgia and Turkey===\nIn 1919, Gurdjieff and his closest pupils moved to [[Tbilisi]]. There, Gurdjieff's wife Julia Ostrowska, the Stjoernvals, the Hartmanns, and the de Salzmanns gathered the fundamentals of his teaching. Gurdjieff concentrated on his still unstaged ballet, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3FpwJ1zkUfUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22G.+Gurdjieff%22&hl=zh-TW&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy8fzF1IzKAhXIFqYKHXq8B6IQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&q&f=false The Struggle of the Magicians]''. [[Thomas de Hartmann]] (who had made his debut years ago, before Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]]), worked on the music for the ballet, and Olga Ivanovna Hinzenberg (who years later wed the American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]), practiced the ballet dances.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore |first=James |title=Gurdjieff |page=132 |year=1999 |publisher=Element Books Ltd |isbn=1-86204-606-9 |quote=What name would you give such an Institute?}}</ref> In 1919, Gurdjieff established his first [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]].\n\nIn late May 1920, when political conditions in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] changed and the old order was crumbling, his party travelled to [[Batumi]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast and then traveled by ship to [[Istanbul]].<ref>[[Thomas de Hartmann]], ''Our Life With Mr. Gurdjieff'' (1962), Penguin 1974 pp.94\u20135.</ref> Gurdjieff rented an apartment on Koumbaradji Street in P\u00e9ra and later at 13 Abdullatif Yemeneci Sokak near the [[Galata Tower]].<ref>[http://www.gurdjieff-movements.net/newsletter/2003-03/06_gurdjieff_istanbul.htm \"In Gurdjieff\u2019s wake in Istanbul\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031072357/http://www.gurdjieff-movements.net/newsletter/2003-03/06_gurdjieff_istanbul.htm |date=2006-10-31 }}, Gurdjieff Movements, March 2003.</ref> The apartment is near the [[Khanqah|kha'neqa'h]] (monastery) of the [[Mevlevi Order]] (a Sufi Order following the teachings of [[Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi]]), where Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and [[Thomas de Hartmann]] witnessed the ''[[sema]]'' ceremony of [[the Whirling Dervishes]]. In Istanbul, Gurdjieff also met his future pupil Capt. [[John G. Bennett]], then head of [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|British Military Intelligence]] in [[Constantinople]], who describes his impression of Gurdjieff as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt was there that I first met Gurdjieff in the autumn of 1920, and no surroundings could have been more appropriate. In Gurdjieff, East and West do not just meet. Their difference is annihilated in a world outlook which knows no distinctions of race or creed. This was my first, and has remained one of my strongest impressions. A Greek from the Caucasus, he spoke [[Turkish language|Turkish]] with an accent of unexpected purity, the accent that one associates with those born and bred in the narrow circle of the [[Ottoman court|Imperial Court]]. His appearance was striking enough even in Turkey, where one saw many unusual types. His head was shaven, immense black moustache, eyes which at one moment seemed very pale and at another almost black. Below average height, he gave nevertheless an impression of great physical strength\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prieur\u00e9'' at Avon===\nIn August 1921 and 1922, Gurdjieff travelled around western Europe, lecturing and giving demonstrations of his work in various cities, such as [[Berlin]] and [[London]]. He attracted the allegiance of Ouspensky's many prominent pupils (notably the editor [[A. R. Orage]]). After an unsuccessful attempt to gain British citizenship, Gurdjieff established the [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] south of [[Paris]] at the ''Prieur\u00e9 des Basses Loges'' in [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] near the famous ''[[Chateau Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].'' The once-impressive but somewhat crumbling mansion set in extensive grounds housed an entourage of several dozen, including some of Gurdjieff's remaining relatives and some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White Russian]] refugees.\n\nNew pupils included [[C. S. Nott]], [[:fr:Ren\u00e9 Zuber|Ren\u00e9 Zuber]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]] and her ward Fritz Peters.\nThe generally intellectual and middle-class types who were attracted to Gurdjieff's teaching often found the Prieur\u00e9's spartan accommodation and emphasis on hard labour in the grounds disconcerting. Gurdjieff was putting into practice his teaching that people need to develop physically, emotionally and intellectually, hence the mixture of lectures, music, dance, and manual work. Older pupils noticed how the Prieur\u00e9 teaching differed from the complex metaphysical \"system\" that had been taught in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurdjieff.org/lipsey1.htm |title=R. Lipsey: '&#39;Gurdjieff Observed'&#39; |publisher=Gurdjieff.org |date=1999-10-01 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> In addition to the physical hardships, his personal behaviour towards pupils could be ferocious:\n\n<blockquote>\nGurdjieff was standing by his bed in a state of what seemed to me to be\ncompletely uncontrolled fury. He was raging at Orage, who stood impassively,\nand very pale, framed in one of the windows.... Suddenly, in the\nspace of an instant, Gurdjieff's voice stopped, his whole personality changed,\nhe gave me a broad smile\u2014looking incredibly peaceful and inwardly quiet\u2014\nmotioned me to leave, and then resumed his tirade with undiminished force.\nThis happened so quickly that I do not believe that Mr. Orage even noticed\nthe break in the rhythm.<ref>Fritz Peters, ''Boyhood with Gurdjieff''.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDuring this period, Gurdjieff acquired notoriety as \"the man who killed Katherine Mansfield\" after [[Katherine Mansfield]] died there of [[tuberculosis]] under his care on 9 January 1923.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moore |first=James |title=Gurdjieff and Mansfield |page=[https://archive.org/details/gurdjieffmansfie0000moor/page/3 3] |quote=In numerous accounts Gurdjieff is defined with stark simplicity as \"the man who killed Katherine Mansfield\". |year=1980 |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=0-7100-0488-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/gurdjieffmansfie0000moor/page/3 }}</ref> However, James Moore and Ouspensky<ref>Ouspensky, ''In search of the Miraculous,'' chapter XVIII, p. 392</ref> argue that Mansfield knew she would soon die and that Gurdjieff made her last days happy and fulfilling.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Ross |title=Gabrielle Hope 1916\u20131962 |journal=Art New Zealand |volume=30 |issue=Winter |publisher=Art New Zealand |url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/hope.htm}}</ref>\n\n===First car accident, writing and visits to North America===\n{{anchor|First car accident, writing and visits to America}}Starting in 1924, Gurdjieff made visits to North America, where he eventually received the pupils taught previously by A.R. Orage. In 1924, while driving alone from Paris to Fontainebleau, he had a near-fatal car accident. Nursed by his wife and mother, he made a slow and painful recovery against medical expectation. Still convalescent, he formally \"disbanded\" his institute on 26 August (in fact, he dispersed only his \"less dedicated\" pupils), which he explained as an undertaking \"in the future, under the pretext of different worthy reasons, to remove from my eyesight all those who by this or that make my life too comfortable\".<ref>Life is Only Real then, when 'I Am'</ref>\n\nAfter recovering, he began writing ''Beelzebub's Tales'', the first part of ''All and Everything'' in a mixture of Armenian and Russian. The book was deliberately convoluted and obscure, forcing the reader to \"work\" to find its meaning. He also composed it according to his own principles, writing in noisy cafes to force a greater effort of concentration.\n\nGurdjieff's mother died in 1925 and his wife developed [[cancer]] and died in June 1926. Ouspensky attended her funeral. According to [[Fritz Peters (writer)|Fritz Peters]], Gurdjieff was in New York from November 1925 to the spring of 1926, when he succeeded in raising over $100,000.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor |first=Paul Beekman |title=Gurdjieff's America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50w1tPTV0EEC&pg=PA103 |page=103 |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-904998-00-6 |quote=What Gurdjieff was doing during the winter of 1925\u20131926...|publisher=Lighthouse Editions Ltd }}</ref> He was to make six or seven trips to the US, where he alienated a number of people with his brash and impudent demands for money.

[[Diana Huebert]] was a regular member of the Chicago group, and documented the several visits Gurdjieff made to the group in 1932 and 1934 in her memoirs on the man.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/253516461/Diana-Faidy-Reminiscences-of-My-Work-With-Gurdjieff|title=Diana Faidy - Reminiscences of My Work with Gurdjieff|last=Faidy|first=Diana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|editor-last=|editor-first=|location=|pages=|chapter=|access-date=12 February 2019|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nDespite his fund-raising efforts in America, the Prieur\u00e9 operation ran into debt and was shut down in 1932. Gurdjieff constituted a new teaching group in Paris. Known as The Rope, it was composed of only women, many of them writers, and several  [[lesbian]]s. Members included [[Kathryn Hulme]], [[Jane Heap]], Margaret Anderson and [[Enrico Caruso]]'s widow, Dorothy. Gurdjieff became acquainted with [[Gertrude Stein]] through Rope members, but she was never a follower.<ref>Rob Baker, \"[http://www.gurdjieff.org/rope.htm No Harem: Gurdjieff and the Women of The Rope]\", 2000. Accessed 10 March 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Gurdjieff stopped work on ''All and Everything.'' He had completed the first two parts of the planned trilogy but only started on the ''Third Series.'' (It was later published under the title ''Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am'.'') In 1936, he settled in a flat at 6, [[:fr:Rue des Colonels-Renard|Rue des Colonels-Renard]] in Paris, where he was to stay for the rest of his life. In 1937, his brother Dmitry died, and The Rope disbanded.\n\n===World War II===\nAlthough the flat at 6 Rue des Colonels-Renard was very small for the purpose, he continued to teach groups of pupils throughout [[World War II]]. Visitors recalled the pantry, stocked with an extraordinary collection of eastern delicacies, which served as his inner sanctum, and the suppers he held with elaborate toasts to \"idiots\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiots-Paris-Diaries-Bennett-Elizabeth/dp/0877287244 |title=J.

Having cut a physically impressive figure for many years, he was now distinctly paunchy. His teaching was now far removed from the original \"system\", being based on proverbs, jokes and personal interaction, although pupils were required to read, three times if possible, copies of his magnum opus ''Beelzebub's Tales''.\n\nHis personal business enterprises (he had intermittently been a dealer in oriental rugs and carpets for much of his life, among other activities) enabled him to offer charitable relief to neighbours who had been affected by the difficult circumstances of the war, and it also brought him to the attention of the authorities, leading to a night in the cells.\n\n===Final years===\nAfter the war, Gurdjieff tried to reconnect with his former pupils. Ouspensky was reluctant, but after his death (October 1947), his widow advised his remaining pupils to see Gurdjieff in Paris. J. G. Bennett also visited from England, the first meeting for 25 years. Ouspensky's pupils in England had all thought that Gurdjieff was dead. They discovered he was alive only after the death of Ouspensky, who had not told them that Gurdjieff was still living. They were overjoyed to hear so, and many of Ouspensky's pupils including Rina Hands, Basil Tilley and Catherine Murphy visited Gurdjieff in Paris. Hands and Murphy worked on the typing and retyping of the forthcoming book ''All and Everything''.\n\nGurdjieff suffered a second car accident in 1948 but again made an unexpected recovery.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"[I] was looking at a dying man. Even this is not enough to express it. It was a dead man, a corpse, that came out of the car; and yet it walked. I was shivering like someone who sees a ghost.\"\n\nWith iron-like tenacity, he managed to gain his room, where he sat down and said: \"Now all organs are destroyed. Must make new\". Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: \"Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work\". As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: \"He has a cerebral haemorrhage. He will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move\". But then he reflected: \"He has to do all this. If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body\".<ref>Perry, Whitall: ''Gurdjieff in the Light of tradition'', quoting J. G. Bennett.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Georges Gurdjieff dead.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The body of Gurdjieff, lying in state, France. 'Every one of those unfortunates during the process of existence should constantly sense and be cognizant of the inevitability of his own death as well as of the death of everyone upon whom his eyes or attention rests'.]]\nAfter recovering, Gurdjieff finalised plans for the official publication of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' and made two trips to New York. He also visited the famous prehistoric cave paintings at [[Lascaux]], giving his interpretation of their significance to his pupils.\n\nGurdjieff died at the American Hospital in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France. His funeral took place at the St. Alexandre Nevsky Russian Orthodox Cathedral at 12 Rue Daru, Paris.

Ouspensky]] (1949), ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]''</ref>\nAs a result of this each person perceives things from a completely subjective perspective. He asserted that people in their typical state function as unconscious [[automaton]]s, but that a person can \"wake up\" and become a different sort of human being altogether.<ref>[http://www.bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/misc/School.html Jacob Needleman, ''G. I. Gurdjieff and His School''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402192646/http://www.bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/misc/School.html |date=2003-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Self-development teachings===\n\n{{main|Fourth Way}}\n\nGurdjieff argued that many of the existing forms of religious and spiritual tradition on Earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception. As a result, humans were failing to realize the truths of ancient teachings and were instead becoming more and more like automatons, susceptible to control from outside and increasingly capable of otherwise unthinkable acts of [[Mass hysteria|mass psychosis]] such as [[World War I]]. At best, the various surviving sects and schools could provide only a one-sided development, which did not result in a fully integrated human being.\n\nAccording to Gurdjieff, only one dimension of the three dimensions of the person\u2014namely, either the emotions, or the physical body or the mind\u2014tends to develop in such schools and sects, and generally at the expense of the other faculties or ''centers,'' as Gurdjieff called them. As a result, these paths fail to produce a properly balanced human being. Furthermore, anyone wishing to undertake any of the traditional paths to spiritual knowledge (which Gurdjieff reduced to three\u2014namely the path of the [[fakir]], the path of the [[monk]], and the path of the [[yogi]]) were required to renounce life in the world. Gurdjieff thus developed a \"Fourth Way\"<ref>[[P.D. Ouspensky]] (1949), ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]],'' Chapter 2</ref> which would be amenable to the requirements of modern people living modern lives in Europe and America. Instead of developing body, mind, or emotions separately, Gurdjieff's discipline worked on all three to promote comprehensive and balanced inner development.\n\nIn parallel with other spiritual traditions, Gurdjieff taught that a person must expend considerable effort to effect the [[Spiritual transformation|transformation]] that leads to [[Mystical experience|awakening]]. The effort that is put into practice Gurdjieff referred to as \"The Work\" or \"Work on oneself\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurdjieff.org/index.en.htm |title=Gurdjieff International Review |publisher=Gurdjieff.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> According to Gurdjieff, \"...Working on oneself is not so difficult as wishing to work, taking the decision.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Gurdjieff |first=George |title=Views from the real world |page=[https://archive.org/details/viewsfromrealwor00gurd/page/214 214] |publisher=E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc. |isbn=0-525-47408-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/viewsfromrealwor00gurd/page/214 }}</ref>\nThough Gurdjieff never put major significance on the term \"Fourth Way\" and never used the term in his writings, his pupil [[P.D. Ouspensky]] from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of Gurdjieff's ideas. After Ouspensky's death, his students published a book titled ''The Fourth Way'' based on his lectures.\n\nGurdjieff's teaching addressed the question of humanity's place in the universe and the importance of developing latent potentialities\u2014regarded as our natural endowment as human beings but rarely brought to fruition. He taught that higher levels of consciousness, higher bodies,<ref>[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1949). ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' Chapter 2</ref> inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1971). ''[[The Fourth Way]],'' Chapter 1</ref>\n\nIn his teaching Gurdjieff gave a distinct meaning to various ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] and many religious [[prayer]]s. He believed that such texts possess meanings very different from those commonly attributed to them. \"Sleep not\"; \"Awake, for you know not the hour\"; and \"The Kingdom of Heaven is Within\" are examples of biblical statements which point to a psychological teaching whose essence has been forgotten.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellbeloved |first=Sophia |title=Gurdjieff: the key concepts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efukKaH6JO4C&pg=PA109&dq=Gurdjieff+psychological+teaching#v=onepage&q=Gurdjieff%20psychological%20teaching&f=false |quote=...different psychological terms in which the teaching of the Institute was presented... |page=109 |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-24897-3 |publisher=Routledge }}</ref>\n\nGurdjieff taught people how to increase and focus their attention and energy in various ways and to minimize daydreaming and absentmindedness. According to his teaching, this inner development of oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change, the aim of which is to transform people into what Gurdjieff believed they ought to be.<ref>[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1949). ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]],'' Chapter 9</ref>\n\nDistrusting \"morality\", which he describes as varying from culture to culture, often contradictory and hypocritical, Gurdjieff greatly stressed the importance of \"[[conscience]]\".\n\nTo provide conditions in which inner attention could be exercised more intensively, Gurdjieff also taught his pupils \"sacred dances\" or \"movements\", later known as the [[Gurdjieff movements]], which they performed together as a group. He also left a body of music, inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places, written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, [[Thomas de Hartmann]].\n\nGurdjieff also used various exercises, such as the \"Stop\" exercise, to prompt self-observation in his students. Other shocks to help awaken his pupils from constant daydreaming were always possible at any moment.\n\n===Methods===\n\"The Work\" is in essence a training in the development of consciousness. Gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials, including meetings, music, movements (sacred dance), writings, lectures, and innovative forms of group and individual work. Part of the function of these various methods was to undermine and undo the ingrained habit patterns of the mind and bring about moments of insight. Since each individual has different requirements, Gurdjieff did not have a one-size-fits-all approach, and he adapted and innovated as circumstance required.<ref>\"Gurdjieff's teachings were transmitted through special conditions and through special forms leading to consciousness: Group Work, physical labor, crafts, ideas exchanges, arts, music, movement, dance, adventures in nature ... enabled the unrealized individual to transcend the mechanical, acted-upon self and ascend from mere personality to self-actualizing essence.\"[http://www.seekerbooks.com/book/9780835608404.htm Seekerbooks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620031630/http://www.seekerbooks.com/book/9780835608404.htm |date=2008-06-20 }}, Book review of Gary Lachman.  ''In Search of the Miraculous: Genius in the Shadow of Gurdjieff.''</ref> In Russia he was described as keeping his teaching confined to a small circle,<ref>[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1949). ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]m'' Chapter 1,</ref> whereas in Paris and North America he gave numerous public demonstrations.<ref>[[G.I. Gurdjieff]] (1963) ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', Chapter 11</ref>\n\nGurdjieff felt that the traditional methods of self-knowledge\u2014those of the [[fakir]], [[monk]], and [[yogi]] (acquired, respectively, through pain, devotion, and study)\u2014were inadequate on their own and often led to various forms of stagnation and one-sidedness. His methods were designed to augment the traditional paths with the purpose of hastening the developmental process. He sometimes called these methods ''The Way of the Sly Man''<ref>See ''In Search of the Miraculous''</ref> because they constituted a sort of short-cut through a process of development that might otherwise carry on for years without substantive results. The teacher, possessing consciousness, sees the individual requirements of the disciple and sets tasks that he knows will result in a transformation of consciousness in that individual. Instructive historical parallels can be found in the annals of [[Zen]] Buddhism, where teachers employed a variety of methods (sometimes highly unorthodox) to bring about the arising of [[Satori|insight]] in the student.\n\n====Music====\nGurdjieff's music divides into three distinct periods. The \"first period\" is the early music, including music from the ballet ''Struggle of the Magicians'' and music for early movements dating to the years around 1918.\n\nThe \"second period\" music, for which Gurdjieff arguably became best known, written in collaboration with Russian composer [[Thomas de Hartmann]], is described as the Gurdjieff-de Hartmann music.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Petsche|first1=Johanna|title=Gurdjieff and Music: The Gurdjieff/de Hartmann Piano Music and its Esoteric Significance|date=2015|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004284425|pages=1\u2013279|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/gurdjieff-and-music|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Inc.1999\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=14 April 2011|date=18 December 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=60\u2013|ISSN=0006-2510 }}</ref>  Dating to the mid-1920s, it offers a rich repertory with roots in Caucasian and Central Asian folk and religious music, Russian Orthodox liturgical music, and other sources.

Gurdjieff sometimes referred to himself as a \"teacher of dancing\" and gained initial public notice for his attempts to put on a ballet in Moscow called ''Struggle of the Magicians.''\n\nFilms of movements demonstrations are occasionally shown for [[private viewing]] by the Gurdjieff Foundations and one is shown in a scene in the Peter Brook movie ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''.\n\n====Writings====\nGurdjieff wrote a unique trilogy with the Series title ''All and Everything''. The first volume, finalized by Gurdjieff shortly before his death and first published in 1950, is the First Series and titled ''[[An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life of Man]]'' or ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]''. At 1238 pages it is a lengthy allegorical work that recounts the explanations of Beelzebub to his grandson concerning the beings of the planet Earth and laws which govern the universe. It provides a vast platform for Gurdjieff's deeply considered philosophy. A controversial redaction of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' was published by some of Gurdjieff's followers as an alternative \"edition,\" in 1992. [See Paul Beekman Taylor's' ''Gurdjieff's Worlds of Words'' (2014) for an informed account.] On his page of ''Friendly Advice'' facing the first Contents page of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' Gurdjieff lays out his own program of three obligatory initial readings of each of the three series in sequence and concludes, \"Only then will you be able to count upon forming your own impartial judgement, proper to yourself alone, on my writings. And only then can my hope be actualized that according to your understanding you will obtain the specific benefit for your self which I anticipate.\"\n\nThe posthumous second series, edited by [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] is titled ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'' (1963) and is written in a seemingly accessible manner as a memoir of his early years, but also contains some 'Arabian Nights' embellishments and allegorical statements. His posthumous Third Series, written as if unfinished and also edited by Jeanne de Salzmann (''[[Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am']]'') contains an intimate account of Gurdjieff's inner struggles during his later years, as well as transcripts of some of his lectures. There is an enormous and growing amount written about Gurdjieff's ideas and methods but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources.\n\n==Reception and influence==\nOpinions on Gurdjieff's writings and activities are divided. Sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into Western culture, a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At the other end of the spectrum, some critics assert he was a [[charlatan]] with a large ego and a constant need for self-glorification.<ref>Michael Waldberg (1990). ''Gurdjieff&nbsp;\u2013 An Approach to his Ideas'', Chapter 1</ref>\nGurdjieff had significant influence on some artists, writers, and thinkers, including [[Walter Inglis Anderson]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Darby Crash]], [[Muriel Draper]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Dennis Lewis]], [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]], [[A. R. Orage]], [[P. D. Ouspensky]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], [[Louis Pauwels]], [[Robert S de Ropp]], [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], [[David Sylvian]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Jeremy Lane (writer)|Jeremy Lane]], [[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[P. L. Travers]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[John Zorn]].<ref>Friedland and Zellman, ''The Fellowship'', pp. 33\u2013135</ref>\n\nGurdjieff's notable personal students include [[P. D. Ouspensky]], [[Olga de Hartmann]], [[Thomas de Hartmann]], [[Jane Heap]], [[Jeanne de Salzmann]], [[Willem Nyland]], [[Henry John Sinclair, 2nd Baron Pentland|Lord Pentland (Henry John Sinclair)]], [[John G. Bennett]], [[Alfred Richard Orage]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], and [[Rene Daumal]].\n\nGurdjieff gave new life and practical form to ancient teachings of both East and West. For example, the Socratic and Platonic emphasis on \"the examined life\" recurs in Gurdjieff's teaching as the practice of self-observation.  His teachings about self-discipline and restraint reflect Stoic teachings. The Hindu and Buddhist notion of attachment recurs in Gurdjieff's teaching as the concept of identification. His descriptions of the \"three being-foods\" matches that of Ayurveda, and his statement that \"time is breath\" echoes jyotish, the Vedic system of astrology.  Similarly, his cosmology can be \"read\" against ancient and esoteric sources, respectively Neoplatonic and in such sources as Robert Fludd's treatment of macrocosmic musical structures.\n\nAn aspect of Gurdjieff's teachings which has come into prominence in recent decades is the [[Fourth Way Enneagram|enneagram]] geometric figure. For many students of the Gurdjieff tradition, the enneagram remains a [[K\u014dan|koan]], challenging and never fully explained. There have been many attempts to trace the origins of this version of the enneagram; some similarities to other figures have been found, but it seems that Gurdjieff was the first person to make the enneagram figure publicly known and that only he knew its true source.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Others have used the enneagram figure in connection with personality analysis, principally with the [[Enneagram of Personality]] as developed by [[Oscar Ichazo]], [[Claudio Naranjo]]  and others.  Most aspects of this application are not directly connected to Gurdjieff's teaching or to his explanations of the enneagram.\n\nGurdjieff inspired the formation of many groups after his death, all of which still function today and follow his ideas.<ref>Seymour B.

Other pupils of Gurdjieff formed independent groups. Willem Nyland, one of Gurdjieff's closest students and an original founder and trustee of The Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, left to form his own groups in the early 1960s. [[Jane Heap]] was sent to London by Gurdjieff, where she led groups until her death in 1964. Louise Goepfert March, who became a pupil of Gurdjieff's in 1929, started her own groups in 1957 and founded the Rochester Folk Art Guild in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of New York State. Independent thriving groups were also formed and initially led by [[John G. Bennett]] and A. L. Staveley near Portland, Oregon.\n\n===Pupils===\n\nGurdjieff's notable pupils include:<ref>Gurdjieff: an Annotated Bibliography, J. Walter Driscoll and the Gurdjieff Foundation of California, Garland, 1985.</ref>\n\n[[Peter D. Ouspensky]] (1878\u20131947) was a Russian journalist, author and philosopher. He met Gurdjieff in 1915 and spent the next five years studying with him, then formed his own independent groups at London in 1921. Ouspensky became the first \"career\" Gurdjieffian and led independent Fourth Way groups in London and New York for his remaining years. He wrote ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' about his encounters with Gurdjieff and it remains the best known and most widely read account of Gurdjieff's early experiments with groups.\n\n[[Thomas de Hartmann]] (1885\u20131956) was a Russian composer. He and his wife Olga first met Gurdjieff in 1916 at Saint Petersburg. They remained Gurdjieff's close students until 1929. During that time they lived at Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man near Paris. Between July 1925 and May 1927 Thomas de Hartmann transcribed and co-wrote some of the music that Gurdjieff collected and used for his Movements exercises. They collaborated on hundreds of pieces of concert music arranged for the piano. This concert music was first recorded and published privately from the 1950s to 1980s; then first issued publicly as the ''Music of Gurdjieff / de Hartmann'', Thomas de Hartmann, piano by Triangle Records, with 49 tracks on 4 vinyl disks in 1998, then reissued as a 3-CD set in containing 56 tracks in 1989. A more extensive compilation was later issued as the ''Gurdjieff / de Hartmann Music for the Piano'' in 4 printed volumes by Schott between 1996 and 2005, and as audio CDs under the same title in four volumes with nine discs recorded with three concert pianists, by Schott/Wergo between 1997 and 2001.  Olga de Hartmann (n\u00e9e Arkadievna, 1885\u20131987) was Gurdjieff's personal secretary during their Prieur\u00e9 years and took most of the original dictations of his writings during that period. She also authenticated Gurdjieff's early talks in the book ''Views from the Real World'' (1973). The de Hartmann's memoir, ''Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff'' (1st ed, 1964, 2nd ed, 1983, 3rd ed 1992), records their Gurdjieff years in great detail. Their Montreal Gurdjieff group, literary and musical estate is represented by retired Canadian [[National Film Board]] producer Tom Daly.i don\u2019t know\n\n[[Jeanne de Salzmann]] (1899\u20131990). Alexander and Jeanne de Salzmann met Gurdjieff in Tiflis in 1919. She was originally a dancer, Dalcroze Eurythmics teacher. She was, along with Jessmin Howarth and Rose Mary Nott, responsible for transmitting Gurdjieff's choreographed movements exercises and institutionalizing Gurdjieff's teachings through the [[Gurdjieff Foundation]] of New York, the Gurdjieff Institute of Paris, London's Gurdjieff Society Inc and other groups, she established in 1953. She also established Triangle Editions in the US, which imprint claims copyright on all Gurdjieff's posthumous writings.\n\n[[John G. Bennett]] (1897\u20131974) was a British intelligence officer, polyglot (fluent in English, French, German, Turkish, Greek, Italian), technologist, industrial research director author and teacher, best known for his many books on psychology and spirituality, particularly the teachings of Gurdjieff. Bennett met both Ouspensky and then Gurdjieff at Istanbul in 1920, spent August 1923 at Gurdjieff's Institute, became Ouspensky's pupil between 1922 and 1941 and, after learning that Gurdjieff was still alive, was one of Gurdjieff's frequent visitors in Paris during 1949. See ''Witness: the Autobiography of John Bennett'' (1974), ''Gurdjieff: Making a New World''(1974), ''Idiots in Paris: diaries of J. G. Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett, 1949'' (1991).\n\n[[Alfred Richard Orage]] (1873\u20131934) was an influential British editor best known for the magazine ''New Age''. He began attending Ouspensky's London talks in 1921 then met Gurdjieff when the latter first visited London early in 1922. Shortly thereafter, Orage sold ''New Age'' and relocated to Gurdjieff's institute at the Prier\u00e9 and in 1924 was appointed by Gurdjieff to lead the institute's branch in New York. After Gurdjieff's nearly fatal automobile accident in July 1924 and because of his prolonged recuperation during 1924 and intense writing period for several years, Orage continued in New York until 1931. During this period, Orage was responsible for editing the English typescript of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' (1931) and ''Meetings with Remarkable Men'' (1963) as Gurdjieff' assistant. This period is described in some detail by Paul Beekman Tayloy in his ''Gurdjieff and Orage: Brothers in Elysium'' (2001).\n\n[[Maurice Nicoll]] (1884\u20131953) was a Harley Street psychiatrist and [[Carl Jung]]'s delegate in London. Along with Orage he attended Ouspensky's 1921 London talks where he met Gurdjieff. With his wife Catherine and their new-born daughter, he spent almost a year at Gurdjieff's Prieur\u00e9 institute. A year later, when they returned to London, Nicoll rejoined Ouspensky's group. In 1931, on Ouspensky's advice he started his own Fourth Way groups in England. He is best known for the encyclopedic six volume series of articles in ''Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky'' (Boston: Shambhala, 1996, and Samuel Weiser Inc., 1996).\n\n[[Willem Nyland]] (1890\u20131975) was a Dutch-American chemist who first met Gurdjieff early in 1924 during the latter's first visit to the US. He was a charter member of the NY branch of Gurdjieff's Institute, participated in Orage's meetings between 1924 and 1931 and was a charter member of the Gurdjieff Foundation from 1953 and through its formative years. In the early 1960s he established an independent group in Warwick NY, where he began making reel-to-reel audio recordings of his meetings which became archived in a private library of some 2600, 90 minute audio tapes. Many of these tapes have also been transcribed and indexed, but remain unpublished. ''Gurdjieff Group Work with Wilhem (sic-Willem) Nyland'' (1983) by Irmis B. Popoff, sketches Nyland's group work.\n\n[[Jane Heap]] (1883\u20131964) was an American writer, editor, artist, and publisher. She met Gurdjieff during his 1924 visit to New York, and set up a Gurdjieff study group at her apartment in Greenwich Village. In 1925, she moved to Paris to study at Gurdjieff's Institute, re-established her group in Paris until 1935 when Gurdjieff sent her to London to lead the group C. S. Nott had established and which she continued to lead until her death. Jane Heap's Paris group became Gurdjieff's 'Rope' group after her departure and contained several notable writers including, [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[Solita Solano]], [[Kathryn Hulme]] and others who proved helpful to Gurdjieff while he was editing his first two books.\n\nKenneth Macfarlane Walker (1882\u20131966) was a prominent British surgeon and prolific author. He was a member of Ouspensky's London group for decades and after the latter's death in 1947 visited Gurdjieff in Paris many times. As well as many accessible medical books for lay readers, he wrote some of the earliest informed accounts of Gurdjieff's ideas, ''Venture with Ideas'' (1951) and ''A Study of Gurdjieff's Teaching'' (1957).\n\n[[Henry John Sinclair, 2nd Baron Pentland]] (1907\u20131984) was a pupil of Ouspensky's during the 1930s and 1940s. He visited Gurdjieff regularly in Paris in 1949, then was appointed as President of the Gurdjieff Foundation of America by Jeanne de Salzmann when she founded that institution at New York in 1953. He established the Gurdjieff Foundation of California in the mid 1950s and remained President of the US Foundation branches until his death. Pentland also became President of Triangle Editions when it was established in 1974.\n\n===Responses===\n[[Louis Pauwels]], among others,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lachman |first=Gary |title=Turn off your mind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jfptmqzTzkC&pg=PA13&dq=critics+of+Gurdjieff+work#v=onepage&q=&f=false |quote=... a hostile book on...

According to Gurdjieff, everything an average person possesses, accomplishes, does, and feels is completely accidental and without any initiative. A common everyday ordinary person is born a machine and dies a machine without any chance of being anything else.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ginsburg |first=Seymour |title=Gurdjieff unveiled |page=6 |year=2005 |publisher=Lighthouse Editions Ltd |isbn=1-904998-01-1| quote=Without any doubt the human psyche and thinking are becoming more and more automatic. }}</ref> This belief seems to run counter to the Judeo-Christian tradition that man is a living soul. Gurdjieff believed that the possession of a soul (a state of psychological unity which he equated with being \"awake\") was a \"luxury\" that a disciple could attain only by the most painstaking work over a long period of time. The majority\u2014in whom the true meaning of the [[gospel]] failed to take root<ref>See The [[Parable of the Sower]]</ref>\u2014went the \"broad way\" that \"led to destruction.\"<ref>''Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.'' [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 7, 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIn ''Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson'' (see bibliography), Gurdjieff expresses his reverence for the founders of the mainstream religions of East and West and his contempt (by and large) for what successive generations of believers have made of those religious teachings. His discussions of \"orthodoxhydooraki\" and \"heterodoxhydooraki\"\u2014orthodox fools and heterodox fools, from the Russian word ''durak'' (fool)\u2014position him as a critic of religious distortion and, in turn, as a target for criticism from some within those traditions.  Gurdjieff has been interpreted by some, Ouspensky among others, to have had a total disregard for the value of mainstream religion, philanthropic work and the value of doing right or wrong in general.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P.

For example, in a written exchange between Luc Dietrich and Henri Tracol dating to 1943:  \"L.D.:  How do you know that Gurdjieff wishes you well?

According to Rom Landau, a journalist in the 1930s, [[Achmed Abdullah]] told him at the beginning of the 20th century that Gurdjieff was a Russian secret agent in Tibet{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to support claim|date=February 2019}} who went by the name of \"Hambro Akuan Dorzhieff\" (i.e. [[Agvan Dorjiev]]), a tutor to the [[Dalai Lama]].<ref>Gary Lachman ''Turn Off Your Mind'', pp. 32\u201333, Disinformation Co., 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-9713942-3-0}}</ref> However, the actual Dorzhieff went to live in the Buddhist temple erected in St. Petersburg and after the Revolution was imprisoned by [[Stalin]].

King wrote that Gurdjieff did not state it as clearly and specifically as this, but was quick to add that to him, nothing Gurdjieff said was specific or clear.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAccording to [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]], the Gurdjieff system is incomplete, drawing from [[Dervish]] sources inimical to [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].

P. Dutton & Co. Inc., ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', published in 1963 by E. P. Dutton & Co. Inc., and ''[[Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am'|Life is Real Only Then, When 'I Am']]'', printed privately by E. P. Dutton & Co. and published in 1978 by Triangle Editions Inc. for private distribution only. This [[trilogy]] is Gurdjieff's legominism, known collectively as ''[[All and Everything]]''. A ''legominism'' is, according to Gurdjieff, \"one of the means of transmitting information about certain events of long-past ages through initiates\". A book of his early talks was also collected by his student and personal secretary, [[Olga de Hartmann]], and published in 1973 as ''[[Views from the Real World|Views from the Real World: Early Talks in Moscow, Essentuki, Tiflis, Berlin, London, Paris, New York, and Chicago, as recollected by his pupils]]''.\n\nGurdjieff's views were initially promoted through the writings of his pupils. The best known and widely read of this is [[P. D. Ouspensky]]'s ''[[In Search of the Miraculous|In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching]]'', which is widely regard as a crucial introduction to the teaching. Others refer to Gurdjieff's own books (detailed below) as the primary texts. Numerous anecdotal accounts of time spent with Gurdjieff were published by [[Charles Stanley Nott]], [[Thomas and Olga de Hartmann]], Fritz Peters, [[Ren\u00e9 Daumal]], [[John G. Bennett]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]] and [[Louis Pauwels]], among others.\n\nThe feature film [[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|''Meetings with Remarkable Men'']] (1979), loosely based on Gurdjieff's book by the same name, ends with performances of Gurdjieff's dances taught known simply as the \"exercises\" but later  promoted as ''[[Movements (sacred dances)|movements]]''. [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] and [[Peter Brook]] wrote the film, Brook directed, and Dragan Maksimovic and [[Terence Stamp]] star, as does South African playwright and actor, [[Athol Fugard]].<ref name=\"PanafieuNeedleman1997\">{{cite book\n|last1=Panafieu\n|first1=Bruno De\n|last2=Needleman\n|first2=Jacob\n|last3=Baker\n|first3=George\n|title=Gurdjieff\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GV0dhZxB91EC&pg=PA28\n|accessdate=14 April 2011\n|date=September 1997\n|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group\n|isbn=978-0-8264-1049-8\n|pages=28\u2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\n* ''[[The Herald of Coming Good]]'' by G.

Edited by Michael Pittman. G. I. Gurdjieff: Armenian Roots, Global Branches. During the early period after Gurdjieff\u2019s arrival in Europe in 1921 he gained significant notoriety in Europe and the United States... In October of 1922, Gurdjieff set up a school at the Prieur\u00e9 des Basses Loges at Fontainebleau-Avon, outside of Paris. It was at the Prieur\u00e9 that Gurdjieff met many notable figures, authors, and artists of the early twentieth century, many of whom went on to be close students and exponents of his teaching. Over the course of his life, those who visited and worked with him included the French author Ren\u00e9 Daumal; the renowned short story author from New Zealand, [[Katherine Mansfield]]; [[Kathryn Hulme]], later the author of ''[[The Nun's Story|A Nun's Life]]''; [[P. L. Travers]], the author of ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]''; and [[Jean Toomer]], the author of ''[[Cane (novel)|Cane]]'', whose work and influence would figure prominently in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]... Numerous study groups, organizations, formal foundations, and even land-based communities have been initiated in his name, primarily in North and South America and Europe, and to a lesser extent, in Japan, China, India, Australia, and South Africa. In 1979, Peter Brook, the British theater director and author, created a film based on ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''.</ref> Gurdjieff taught that most humans do not possess a unified consciousness and thus live their lives in a state of hypnotic \"waking sleep\", but that it is possible to awaken to a higher state of consciousness and achieve full human potential. Gurdjieff described a method attempting to do so, calling the discipline \"The Work\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P.

Greek-Russian and Greek-Georgian were also very common combinations in Kars Oblast and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the [[Tsarist]] rule.\n</ref> The exact year of his birth remains unknown; conjectures range from 1866 to 1877. Some authors (such as James Moore) argue for 1866. Both Olga de Hartmann, the woman Gurdjieff called \"the first friend of my inner life\", and Louise Goepfert March, Gurdjieff's secretary in the early 1930s, believed that Gurdjieff was born in 1872. A passport gave a birthdate of November 28, 1877, but he once stated that he was born at the stroke of midnight at the beginning of New Year's Day ([[Julian calendar]]). Although the dates of his birth vary, the year of 1872 is inscribed in a plate on the gravemarker in the cemetery of [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne]], France, where his body was buried.<ref>https://www.landrucimetieres.fr/spip/spip.php?article1949</ref>\n\nGurdjieff spent his childhood in [[Kars]], which, from 1878 to 1918, was the administrative capital of the Russian-ruled Transcaucasus province of Kars Oblast, a border region recently captured from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It contained extensive grassy plateau-steppe and high mountains, and was inhabited by a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional population that had a history of respect for travelling mystics and holy men, and for religious [[syncretism]] and [[religious conversion|conversion]]. Both the city of Kars and the surrounding territory were home to an extremely diverse population: although part of the [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian Plateau]], Kars Oblast was home to Armenians, Russians, Caucasus Greeks, Georgians, Turks, Kurds and smaller numbers of Christian communities from eastern and central Europe such as [[Caucasus Germans]], [[Estonians]] and Russian sectarian communities like the [[Molokans]], [[Doukhobors]], ''Pryguny'', and ''[[Subbotniki]]''. Gurdjieff makes particular mention of the [[Yazidi]] community. Growing up in a multi-ethnic society, Gurdjieff became fluent in Armenian, Pontic Greek, Russian and Turkish, speaking the last in a mixture of elegant [[Ottoman Turkish language|Osmanl\u0131]] and some dialect.<ref>John G. Bennett, ''Witness'', Omen press, Arizona 1974 p. 55.</ref> He later acquired \"a working facility with several European languages\".<ref name=\"Challenger\"/> Early influences on him included his father, a carpenter and amateur ''[[ashik]]'' or [[bard]]ic poet,<ref>\n''Meetings with Remarkable Men'', Chapter II. Gurdjieff uses the spelling \"ashok\".</ref> and the priest of the town's [[Cathedral of Kars|Russian church]], [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] Borsh, a family friend. The young Gurdjieff avidly read Russian-language scientific literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookofdaystales.com/tag/spirituality/|title=spirituality \u2013 BOOK OF DAYS TALES|website=www.bookofdaystales.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref> Influenced by these writings, and having witnessed a number of phenomena that he could not explain, he formed the conviction that there existed a hidden truth not to be found in science or in mainstream religion.\n\n===Travels===\nIn early adulthood, according to his own account, Gurdjieff's curiosity led him to travel to [[Central Asia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Tibet]] and [[Rome]] before he returned to [[Russia]] for a few years in 1912. He was never forthcoming about the source of his teachings. The only account of his wanderings appears in his book ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''. Most commentators<ref>J.G.Bennet 'Gurdjieff \u2013 Making a New World'</ref> leave his background unexplained, and it is not generally considered to be a reliable or straightforward autobiography.<ref>S.

G. Bennett]] researched his sources extensively and suggested that these characters were symbolic of the three types of people to whom Gurdjieff referred: No. 1 centred in their physical body; No. 2 centred in their emotions and No. 3 centred in their minds. He asserts that he has encounters with [[dervish]]es, [[fakir]]s and descendants of the extinct [[Essenes]], whose teaching had been, he said, conserved at a monastery in Sarmoung. The book also has an overarching [[quest]] [[narrative]] involving a map of \"pre-sand Egypt\" and culminating in an encounter with the \"[[Sarmoung Brotherhood]]\".<ref name=\"sedgwick\">Mark Sedgwick, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=7cjFFgvUdDUC&pg=PA208 European Neo-Sufi Movements in the Inter-war Period]\" in ''Islam in Inter-War Europe'', ed. by Natalie Clayer and Eric Germain.

In the same year, he married the [[Poles|Polish]] Julia Ostrowska in [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1914, Gurdjieff advertised his ballet, ''The Struggle of the Magicians,'' and he supervised his pupils' writing of the sketch ''Glimpses of Truth.'' In 1915, Gurdjieff accepted [[P. D. Ouspensky]] as a pupil, and in 1916, he accepted the composer [[Thomas de Hartmann]] and his wife, Olga, as students. Then, he had about 30 pupils. Ouspensky already had a reputation as a writer on mystical subjects and had conducted his own, ultimately disappointing, search for wisdom in the East. The Fourth Way \"system\" taught during this period was complex and metaphysical, partly expressed in scientific terminology.\n\nIn the midst of revolutionary upheaval in Russia, Gurdjieff left [[Petrograd]] in 1917 to return to his family home in Alexandropol. During the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], he set up temporary study communities in [[Essentuki]] in the [[Caucasus]], then in [[Tuapse]], [[Maikop]], [[Sochi]] and [[Poti]], all on the [[Black Sea]] coast of southern Russia, where he worked intensively with many of his Russian pupils. Gurdjieff said, \"Begin in Russia, End in Russia\".\n\nIn March 1918, Ouspensky separated from Gurdjieff, settling in England and teaching the Fourth Way in his own right. The two men were to have a very ambivalent relationship for decades to come.\n\nFour months later, Gurdjieff's eldest sister and her family reached him in [[Essentuki]] as refugees, informing him that Turks had shot his father in [[Alexandropol]] on 15 May. As Essentuki became more and more threatened by civil war, Gurdjieff fabricated a newspaper story announcing his forthcoming \"scientific expedition\" to \"Mount Induc\". Posing as a scientist, Gurdjieff left Essentuki with fourteen companions (excluding Gurdjieff's family and Ouspensky). They travelled by train to Maikop, where hostilities delayed them for three weeks. In spring 1919, Gurdjieff met the artist Alexandre de Salzmann and his wife Jeanne and accepted them as pupils. Assisted by Jeanne de Salzmann, Gurdjieff gave the first public demonstration of his [[Gurdjieff movements|Sacred Dances]] (Movements at the [[Tbilisi]] Opera House, 22 June).\n\n===In Georgia and Turkey===\nIn 1919, Gurdjieff and his closest pupils moved to [[Tbilisi]]. There, Gurdjieff's wife Julia Ostrowska, the Stjoernvals, the Hartmanns, and the de Salzmanns gathered the fundamentals of his teaching. Gurdjieff concentrated on his still unstaged ballet, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3FpwJ1zkUfUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22G.+Gurdjieff%22&hl=zh-TW&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy8fzF1IzKAhXIFqYKHXq8B6IQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&q&f=false The Struggle of the Magicians]''. [[Thomas de Hartmann]] (who had made his debut years ago, before Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]]), worked on the music for the ballet, and Olga Ivanovna Hinzenberg (who years later wed the American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]), practiced the ballet dances.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore |first=James |title=Gurdjieff |page=132 |year=1999 |publisher=Element Books Ltd |isbn=1-86204-606-9 |quote=What name would you give such an Institute?}}</ref> In 1919, Gurdjieff established his first [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]].\n\nIn late May 1920, when political conditions in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] changed and the old order was crumbling, his party travelled to [[Batumi]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast and then traveled by ship to [[Istanbul]].<ref>[[Thomas de Hartmann]], ''Our Life With Mr. Gurdjieff'' (1962), Penguin 1974 pp.94\u20135.</ref> Gurdjieff rented an apartment on Koumbaradji Street in P\u00e9ra and later at 13 Abdullatif Yemeneci Sokak near the [[Galata Tower]].<ref>[http://www.gurdjieff-movements.net/newsletter/2003-03/06_gurdjieff_istanbul.htm \"In Gurdjieff\u2019s wake in Istanbul\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031072357/http://www.gurdjieff-movements.net/newsletter/2003-03/06_gurdjieff_istanbul.htm |date=2006-10-31 }}, Gurdjieff Movements, March 2003.</ref> The apartment is near the [[Khanqah|kha'neqa'h]] (monastery) of the [[Mevlevi Order]] (a Sufi Order following the teachings of [[Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi]]), where Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and [[Thomas de Hartmann]] witnessed the ''[[sema]]'' ceremony of [[the Whirling Dervishes]]. In Istanbul, Gurdjieff also met his future pupil Capt. [[John G. Bennett]], then head of [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|British Military Intelligence]] in [[Constantinople]], who describes his impression of Gurdjieff as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt was there that I first met Gurdjieff in the autumn of 1920, and no surroundings could have been more appropriate. In Gurdjieff, East and West do not just meet. Their difference is annihilated in a world outlook which knows no distinctions of race or creed. This was my first, and has remained one of my strongest impressions. A Greek from the Caucasus, he spoke [[Turkish language|Turkish]] with an accent of unexpected purity, the accent that one associates with those born and bred in the narrow circle of the [[Ottoman court|Imperial Court]]. His appearance was striking enough even in Turkey, where one saw many unusual types. His head was shaven, immense black moustache, eyes which at one moment seemed very pale and at another almost black. Below average height, he gave nevertheless an impression of great physical strength\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prieur\u00e9'' at Avon===\nIn August 1921 and 1922, Gurdjieff travelled around western Europe, lecturing and giving demonstrations of his work in various cities, such as [[Berlin]] and [[London]]. He attracted the allegiance of Ouspensky's many prominent pupils (notably the editor [[A. R. Orage]]). After an unsuccessful attempt to gain British citizenship, Gurdjieff established the [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] south of [[Paris]] at the ''Prieur\u00e9 des Basses Loges'' in [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] near the famous ''[[Chateau Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].'' The once-impressive but somewhat crumbling mansion set in extensive grounds housed an entourage of several dozen, including some of Gurdjieff's remaining relatives and some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White Russian]] refugees.\n\nNew pupils included [[C. S. Nott]], [[:fr:Ren\u00e9 Zuber|Ren\u00e9 Zuber]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]] and her ward Fritz Peters.\nThe generally intellectual and middle-class types who were attracted to Gurdjieff's teaching often found the Prieur\u00e9's spartan accommodation and emphasis on hard labour in the grounds disconcerting. Gurdjieff was putting into practice his teaching that people need to develop physically, emotionally and intellectually, hence the mixture of lectures, music, dance, and manual work. Older pupils noticed how the Prieur\u00e9 teaching differed from the complex metaphysical \"system\" that had been taught in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurdjieff.org/lipsey1.htm |title=R. Lipsey: '&#39;Gurdjieff Observed'&#39; |publisher=Gurdjieff.org |date=1999-10-01 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> In addition to the physical hardships, his personal behaviour towards pupils could be ferocious:\n\n<blockquote>\nGurdjieff was standing by his bed in a state of what seemed to me to be\ncompletely uncontrolled fury. He was raging at Orage, who stood impassively,\nand very pale, framed in one of the windows.... Suddenly, in the\nspace of an instant, Gurdjieff's voice stopped, his whole personality changed,\nhe gave me a broad smile\u2014looking incredibly peaceful and inwardly quiet\u2014\nmotioned me to leave, and then resumed his tirade with undiminished force.\nThis happened so quickly that I do not believe that Mr. Orage even noticed\nthe break in the rhythm.<ref>Fritz Peters, ''Boyhood with Gurdjieff''.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDuring this period, Gurdjieff acquired notoriety as \"the man who killed Katherine Mansfield\" after [[Katherine Mansfield]] died there of [[tuberculosis]] under his care on 9 January 1923.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moore |first=James |title=Gurdjieff and Mansfield |page=[https://archive.org/details/gurdjieffmansfie0000moor/page/3 3] |quote=In numerous accounts Gurdjieff is defined with stark simplicity as \"the man who killed Katherine Mansfield\". |year=1980 |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=0-7100-0488-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/gurdjieffmansfie0000moor/page/3 }}</ref> However, James Moore and Ouspensky<ref>Ouspensky, ''In search of the Miraculous,'' chapter XVIII, p. 392</ref> argue that Mansfield knew she would soon die and that Gurdjieff made her last days happy and fulfilling.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Ross |title=Gabrielle Hope 1916\u20131962 |journal=Art New Zealand |volume=30 |issue=Winter |publisher=Art New Zealand |url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/hope.htm}}</ref>\n\n===First car accident, writing and visits to North America===\n{{anchor|First car accident, writing and visits to America}}Starting in 1924, Gurdjieff made visits to North America, where he eventually received the pupils taught previously by A.R. Orage. In 1924, while driving alone from Paris to Fontainebleau, he had a near-fatal car accident. Nursed by his wife and mother, he made a slow and painful recovery against medical expectation. Still convalescent, he formally \"disbanded\" his institute on 26 August (in fact, he dispersed only his \"less dedicated\" pupils), which he explained as an undertaking \"in the future, under the pretext of different worthy reasons, to remove from my eyesight all those who by this or that make my life too comfortable\".<ref>Life is Only Real then, when 'I Am'</ref>\n\nAfter recovering, he began writing ''Beelzebub's Tales'', the first part of ''All and Everything'' in a mixture of Armenian and Russian. The book was deliberately convoluted and obscure, forcing the reader to \"work\" to find its meaning. He also composed it according to his own principles, writing in noisy cafes to force a greater effort of concentration.\n\nGurdjieff's mother died in 1925 and his wife developed [[cancer]] and died in June 1926. Ouspensky attended her funeral. According to [[Fritz Peters (writer)|Fritz Peters]], Gurdjieff was in New York from November 1925 to the spring of 1926, when he succeeded in raising over $100,000.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor |first=Paul Beekman |title=Gurdjieff's America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50w1tPTV0EEC&pg=PA103 |page=103 |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-904998-00-6 |quote=What Gurdjieff was doing during the winter of 1925\u20131926...|publisher=Lighthouse Editions Ltd }}</ref> He was to make six or seven trips to the US, where he alienated a number of people with his brash and impudent demands for money.

Gurdjieff constituted a new teaching group in Paris. Known as The Rope, it was composed of only women, many of them writers, and several  [[lesbian]]s. Members included [[Kathryn Hulme]], [[Jane Heap]], Margaret Anderson and [[Enrico Caruso]]'s widow, Dorothy. Gurdjieff became acquainted with [[Gertrude Stein]] through Rope members, but she was never a follower.<ref>Rob Baker, \"[http://www.gurdjieff.org/rope.htm No Harem: Gurdjieff and the Women of The Rope]\", 2000.

(It was later published under the title ''Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am'.'') In 1936, he settled in a flat at 6, [[:fr:Rue des Colonels-Renard|Rue des Colonels-Renard]] in Paris, where he was to stay for the rest of his life.

His teaching was now far removed from the original \"system\", being based on proverbs, jokes and personal interaction, although pupils were required to read, three times if possible, copies of his magnum opus ''Beelzebub's Tales''.\n\nHis personal business enterprises (he had intermittently been a dealer in oriental rugs and carpets for much of his life, among other activities) enabled him to offer charitable relief to neighbours who had been affected by the difficult circumstances of the war, and it also brought him to the attention of the authorities, leading to a night in the cells.\n\n===Final years===\nAfter the war, Gurdjieff tried to reconnect with his former pupils. Ouspensky was reluctant, but after his death (October 1947), his widow advised his remaining pupils to see Gurdjieff in Paris. J. G. Bennett also visited from England, the first meeting for 25 years. Ouspensky's pupils in England had all thought that Gurdjieff was dead. They discovered he was alive only after the death of Ouspensky, who had not told them that Gurdjieff was still living. They were overjoyed to hear so, and many of Ouspensky's pupils including Rina Hands, Basil Tilley and Catherine Murphy visited Gurdjieff in Paris. Hands and Murphy worked on the typing and retyping of the forthcoming book ''All and Everything''.\n\nGurdjieff suffered a second car accident in 1948 but again made an unexpected recovery.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"[I] was looking at a dying man. Even this is not enough to express it. It was a dead man, a corpse, that came out of the car; and yet it walked. I was shivering like someone who sees a ghost.\"\n\nWith iron-like tenacity, he managed to gain his room, where he sat down and said: \"Now all organs are destroyed. Must make new\". Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: \"Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work\". As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: \"He has a cerebral haemorrhage. He will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move\". But then he reflected: \"He has to do all this. If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body\".<ref>Perry, Whitall: ''Gurdjieff in the Light of tradition'', quoting J. G. Bennett.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Georges Gurdjieff dead.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The body of Gurdjieff, lying in state, France. 'Every one of those unfortunates during the process of existence should constantly sense and be cognizant of the inevitability of his own death as well as of the death of everyone upon whom his eyes or attention rests'.]]\nAfter recovering, Gurdjieff finalised plans for the official publication of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' and made two trips to New York. He also visited the famous prehistoric cave paintings at [[Lascaux]], giving his interpretation of their significance to his pupils.\n\nGurdjieff died at the American Hospital in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France. His funeral took place at the St. Alexandre Nevsky Russian Orthodox Cathedral at 12 Rue Daru, Paris. He is buried in the cemetery at Avon (near Fontainebleau).<ref>[[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]] (1993).

Ouspensky]] (1949), ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]''</ref>\nAs a result of this each person perceives things from a completely subjective perspective. He asserted that people in their typical state function as unconscious [[automaton]]s, but that a person can \"wake up\" and become a different sort of human being altogether.<ref>[http://www.bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/misc/School.html Jacob Needleman, ''G. I. Gurdjieff and His School''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402192646/http://www.bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/misc/School.html |date=2003-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Self-development teachings===\n\n{{main|Fourth Way}}\n\nGurdjieff argued that many of the existing forms of religious and spiritual tradition on Earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception. As a result, humans were failing to realize the truths of ancient teachings and were instead becoming more and more like automatons, susceptible to control from outside and increasingly capable of otherwise unthinkable acts of [[Mass hysteria|mass psychosis]] such as [[World War I]]. At best, the various surviving sects and schools could provide only a one-sided development, which did not result in a fully integrated human being.\n\nAccording to Gurdjieff, only one dimension of the three dimensions of the person\u2014namely, either the emotions, or the physical body or the mind\u2014tends to develop in such schools and sects, and generally at the expense of the other faculties or ''centers,'' as Gurdjieff called them. As a result, these paths fail to produce a properly balanced human being. Furthermore, anyone wishing to undertake any of the traditional paths to spiritual knowledge (which Gurdjieff reduced to three\u2014namely the path of the [[fakir]], the path of the [[monk]], and the path of the [[yogi]]) were required to renounce life in the world. Gurdjieff thus developed a \"Fourth Way\"<ref>[[P.D. Ouspensky]] (1949), ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]],'' Chapter 2</ref> which would be amenable to the requirements of modern people living modern lives in Europe and America. Instead of developing body, mind, or emotions separately, Gurdjieff's discipline worked on all three to promote comprehensive and balanced inner development.\n\nIn parallel with other spiritual traditions, Gurdjieff taught that a person must expend considerable effort to effect the [[Spiritual transformation|transformation]] that leads to [[Mystical experience|awakening]]. The effort that is put into practice Gurdjieff referred to as \"The Work\" or \"Work on oneself\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurdjieff.org/index.en.htm |title=Gurdjieff International Review |publisher=Gurdjieff.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> According to Gurdjieff, \"...Working on oneself is not so difficult as wishing to work, taking the decision.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Gurdjieff |first=George |title=Views from the real world |page=[https://archive.org/details/viewsfromrealwor00gurd/page/214 214] |publisher=E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc. |isbn=0-525-47408-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/viewsfromrealwor00gurd/page/214 }}</ref>\nThough Gurdjieff never put major significance on the term \"Fourth Way\" and never used the term in his writings, his pupil [[P.D. Ouspensky]] from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of Gurdjieff's ideas. After Ouspensky's death, his students published a book titled ''The Fourth Way'' based on his lectures.\n\nGurdjieff's teaching addressed the question of humanity's place in the universe and the importance of developing latent potentialities\u2014regarded as our natural endowment as human beings but rarely brought to fruition. He taught that higher levels of consciousness, higher bodies,<ref>[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1949). ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' Chapter 2</ref> inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1971). ''[[The Fourth Way]],'' Chapter 1</ref>\n\nIn his teaching Gurdjieff gave a distinct meaning to various ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] and many religious [[prayer]]s. He believed that such texts possess meanings very different from those commonly attributed to them. \"Sleep not\"; \"Awake, for you know not the hour\"; and \"The Kingdom of Heaven is Within\" are examples of biblical statements which point to a psychological teaching whose essence has been forgotten.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellbeloved |first=Sophia |title=Gurdjieff: the key concepts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efukKaH6JO4C&pg=PA109&dq=Gurdjieff+psychological+teaching#v=onepage&q=Gurdjieff%20psychological%20teaching&f=false |quote=...different psychological terms in which the teaching of the Institute was presented... |page=109 |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-24897-3 |publisher=Routledge }}</ref>\n\nGurdjieff taught people how to increase and focus their attention and energy in various ways and to minimize daydreaming and absentmindedness. According to his teaching, this inner development of oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change, the aim of which is to transform people into what Gurdjieff believed they ought to be.<ref>[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1949). ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]],'' Chapter 9</ref>\n\nDistrusting \"morality\", which he describes as varying from culture to culture, often contradictory and hypocritical, Gurdjieff greatly stressed the importance of \"[[conscience]]\".\n\nTo provide conditions in which inner attention could be exercised more intensively, Gurdjieff also taught his pupils \"sacred dances\" or \"movements\", later known as the [[Gurdjieff movements]], which they performed together as a group. He also left a body of music, inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places, written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, [[Thomas de Hartmann]].\n\nGurdjieff also used various exercises, such as the \"Stop\" exercise, to prompt self-observation in his students. Other shocks to help awaken his pupils from constant daydreaming were always possible at any moment.\n\n===Methods===\n\"The Work\" is in essence a training in the development of consciousness. Gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials, including meetings, music, movements (sacred dance), writings, lectures, and innovative forms of group and individual work. Part of the function of these various methods was to undermine and undo the ingrained habit patterns of the mind and bring about moments of insight. Since each individual has different requirements, Gurdjieff did not have a one-size-fits-all approach, and he adapted and innovated as circumstance required.<ref>\"Gurdjieff's teachings were transmitted through special conditions and through special forms leading to consciousness: Group Work, physical labor, crafts, ideas exchanges, arts, music, movement, dance, adventures in nature ... enabled the unrealized individual to transcend the mechanical, acted-upon self and ascend from mere personality to self-actualizing essence.\"[http://www.seekerbooks.com/book/9780835608404.htm Seekerbooks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620031630/http://www.seekerbooks.com/book/9780835608404.htm |date=2008-06-20 }}, Book review of Gary Lachman.  ''In Search of the Miraculous: Genius in the Shadow of Gurdjieff.''</ref> In Russia he was described as keeping his teaching confined to a small circle,<ref>[[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1949). ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]m'' Chapter 1,</ref> whereas in Paris and North America he gave numerous public demonstrations.<ref>[[G.I. Gurdjieff]] (1963) ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', Chapter 11</ref>\n\nGurdjieff felt that the traditional methods of self-knowledge\u2014those of the [[fakir]], [[monk]], and [[yogi]] (acquired, respectively, through pain, devotion, and study)\u2014were inadequate on their own and often led to various forms of stagnation and one-sidedness. His methods were designed to augment the traditional paths with the purpose of hastening the developmental process. He sometimes called these methods ''The Way of the Sly Man''<ref>See ''In Search of the Miraculous''</ref> because they constituted a sort of short-cut through a process of development that might otherwise carry on for years without substantive results. The teacher, possessing consciousness, sees the individual requirements of the disciple and sets tasks that he knows will result in a transformation of consciousness in that individual. Instructive historical parallels can be found in the annals of [[Zen]] Buddhism, where teachers employed a variety of methods (sometimes highly unorthodox) to bring about the arising of [[Satori|insight]] in the student.\n\n====Music====\nGurdjieff's music divides into three distinct periods. The \"first period\" is the early music, including music from the ballet ''Struggle of the Magicians'' and music for early movements dating to the years around 1918.\n\nThe \"second period\" music, for which Gurdjieff arguably became best known, written in collaboration with Russian composer [[Thomas de Hartmann]], is described as the Gurdjieff-de Hartmann music.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Petsche|first1=Johanna|title=Gurdjieff and Music: The Gurdjieff/de Hartmann Piano Music and its Esoteric Significance|date=2015|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004284425|pages=1\u2013279|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/gurdjieff-and-music|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Inc.1999\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=14 April 2011|date=18 December 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=60\u2013|ISSN=0006-2510 }}</ref>  Dating to the mid-1920s, it offers a rich repertory with roots in Caucasian and Central Asian folk and religious music, Russian Orthodox liturgical music, and other sources.

Since the publication of four volumes of this piano repertory by Schott, recently completed, there has been a wealth of new recordings, including orchestral versions of music prepared by Gurdjieff and de Hartmann for the Movements demonstrations of 1923\u201324.

In all, Gurdjieff in collaboration with de Hartmann composed some 200 pieces.<ref>[http://www.gurdjieff.org.uk/gs6.htm Gurdjieff.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829231045/http://www.gurdjieff.org.uk/gs6.htm |date=August 29, 2012 }}</ref> In May 2010, 38 minutes of unreleased solo piano music on [[Acetate disc|acetate]] was purchased by Neil Kempfer Stocker from the estate of his late step-daughter, Dushka Howarth.

Gurdjieff sometimes referred to himself as a \"teacher of dancing\" and gained initial public notice for his attempts to put on a ballet in Moscow called ''Struggle of the Magicians.''\n\nFilms of movements demonstrations are occasionally shown for [[private viewing]] by the Gurdjieff Foundations and one is shown in a scene in the Peter Brook movie ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''.\n\n====Writings====\nGurdjieff wrote a unique trilogy with the Series title ''All and Everything''. The first volume, finalized by Gurdjieff shortly before his death and first published in 1950, is the First Series and titled ''[[An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life of Man]]'' or ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]''. At 1238 pages it is a lengthy allegorical work that recounts the explanations of Beelzebub to his grandson concerning the beings of the planet Earth and laws which govern the universe. It provides a vast platform for Gurdjieff's deeply considered philosophy. A controversial redaction of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' was published by some of Gurdjieff's followers as an alternative \"edition,\" in 1992. [See Paul Beekman Taylor's' ''Gurdjieff's Worlds of Words'' (2014) for an informed account.] On his page of ''Friendly Advice'' facing the first Contents page of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' Gurdjieff lays out his own program of three obligatory initial readings of each of the three series in sequence and concludes, \"Only then will you be able to count upon forming your own impartial judgement, proper to yourself alone, on my writings. And only then can my hope be actualized that according to your understanding you will obtain the specific benefit for your self which I anticipate.\"\n\nThe posthumous second series, edited by [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] is titled ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'' (1963) and is written in a seemingly accessible manner as a memoir of his early years, but also contains some 'Arabian Nights' embellishments and allegorical statements. His posthumous Third Series, written as if unfinished and also edited by Jeanne de Salzmann (''[[Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am']]'') contains an intimate account of Gurdjieff's inner struggles during his later years, as well as transcripts of some of his lectures. There is an enormous and growing amount written about Gurdjieff's ideas and methods but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources.\n\n==Reception and influence==\nOpinions on Gurdjieff's writings and activities are divided. Sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into Western culture, a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At the other end of the spectrum, some critics assert he was a [[charlatan]] with a large ego and a constant need for self-glorification.<ref>Michael Waldberg (1990). ''Gurdjieff&nbsp;\u2013 An Approach to his Ideas'', Chapter 1</ref>\nGurdjieff had significant influence on some artists, writers, and thinkers, including [[Walter Inglis Anderson]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Darby Crash]], [[Muriel Draper]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Dennis Lewis]], [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]], [[A. R. Orage]], [[P. D. Ouspensky]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], [[Louis Pauwels]], [[Robert S de Ropp]], [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], [[David Sylvian]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Jeremy Lane (writer)|Jeremy Lane]], [[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[P. L. Travers]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[John Zorn]].<ref>Friedland and Zellman, ''The Fellowship'', pp. 33\u2013135</ref>\n\nGurdjieff's notable personal students include [[P. D. Ouspensky]], [[Olga de Hartmann]], [[Thomas de Hartmann]], [[Jane Heap]], [[Jeanne de Salzmann]], [[Willem Nyland]], [[Henry John Sinclair, 2nd Baron Pentland|Lord Pentland (Henry John Sinclair)]], [[John G. Bennett]], [[Alfred Richard Orage]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], and [[Rene Daumal]].\n\nGurdjieff gave new life and practical form to ancient teachings of both East and West. For example, the Socratic and Platonic emphasis on \"the examined life\" recurs in Gurdjieff's teaching as the practice of self-observation.  His teachings about self-discipline and restraint reflect Stoic teachings. The Hindu and Buddhist notion of attachment recurs in Gurdjieff's teaching as the concept of identification. His descriptions of the \"three being-foods\" matches that of Ayurveda, and his statement that \"time is breath\" echoes jyotish, the Vedic system of astrology.  Similarly, his cosmology can be \"read\" against ancient and esoteric sources, respectively Neoplatonic and in such sources as Robert Fludd's treatment of macrocosmic musical structures.\n\nAn aspect of Gurdjieff's teachings which has come into prominence in recent decades is the [[Fourth Way Enneagram|enneagram]] geometric figure. For many students of the Gurdjieff tradition, the enneagram remains a [[K\u014dan|koan]], challenging and never fully explained. There have been many attempts to trace the origins of this version of the enneagram; some similarities to other figures have been found, but it seems that Gurdjieff was the first person to make the enneagram figure publicly known and that only he knew its true source.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Others have used the enneagram figure in connection with personality analysis, principally with the [[Enneagram of Personality]] as developed by [[Oscar Ichazo]], [[Claudio Naranjo]]  and others.  Most aspects of this application are not directly connected to Gurdjieff's teaching or to his explanations of the enneagram.\n\nGurdjieff inspired the formation of many groups after his death, all of which still function today and follow his ideas.<ref>Seymour B. Ginsburg ''Gurdjieff Unveiled'', pp. 71\u20137, Lighthouse Editions Ltd., 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-904998-01-3}}</ref>  The [[Gurdjieff Foundation]], the largest establishment organization influenced by the ideas of Gurdjieff, was organized by [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] during the early 1950s, and led by her in cooperation with other pupils of his. Other pupils of Gurdjieff formed independent groups. Willem Nyland, one of Gurdjieff's closest students and an original founder and trustee of The Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, left to form his own groups in the early 1960s. [[Jane Heap]] was sent to London by Gurdjieff, where she led groups until her death in 1964. Louise Goepfert March, who became a pupil of Gurdjieff's in 1929, started her own groups in 1957 and founded the Rochester Folk Art Guild in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of New York State. Independent thriving groups were also formed and initially led by [[John G. Bennett]] and A. L. Staveley near Portland, Oregon.\n\n===Pupils===\n\nGurdjieff's notable pupils include:<ref>Gurdjieff: an Annotated Bibliography, J. Walter Driscoll and the Gurdjieff Foundation of California, Garland, 1985.</ref>\n\n[[Peter D. Ouspensky]] (1878\u20131947) was a Russian journalist, author and philosopher. He met Gurdjieff in 1915 and spent the next five years studying with him, then formed his own independent groups at London in 1921. Ouspensky became the first \"career\" Gurdjieffian and led independent Fourth Way groups in London and New York for his remaining years. He wrote ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' about his encounters with Gurdjieff and it remains the best known and most widely read account of Gurdjieff's early experiments with groups.\n\n[[Thomas de Hartmann]] (1885\u20131956) was a Russian composer. He and his wife Olga first met Gurdjieff in 1916 at Saint Petersburg. They remained Gurdjieff's close students until 1929. During that time they lived at Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man near Paris. Between July 1925 and May 1927 Thomas de Hartmann transcribed and co-wrote some of the music that Gurdjieff collected and used for his Movements exercises. They collaborated on hundreds of pieces of concert music arranged for the piano. This concert music was first recorded and published privately from the 1950s to 1980s; then first issued publicly as the ''Music of Gurdjieff / de Hartmann'', Thomas de Hartmann, piano by Triangle Records, with 49 tracks on 4 vinyl disks in 1998, then reissued as a 3-CD set in containing 56 tracks in 1989. A more extensive compilation was later issued as the ''Gurdjieff / de Hartmann Music for the Piano'' in 4 printed volumes by Schott between 1996 and 2005, and as audio CDs under the same title in four volumes with nine discs recorded with three concert pianists, by Schott/Wergo between 1997 and 2001.  Olga de Hartmann (n\u00e9e Arkadievna, 1885\u20131987) was Gurdjieff's personal secretary during their Prieur\u00e9 years and took most of the original dictations of his writings during that period. She also authenticated Gurdjieff's early talks in the book ''Views from the Real World'' (1973). The de Hartmann's memoir, ''Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff'' (1st ed, 1964, 2nd ed, 1983, 3rd ed 1992), records their Gurdjieff years in great detail. Their Montreal Gurdjieff group, literary and musical estate is represented by retired Canadian [[National Film Board]] producer Tom Daly.\n\n[[Jeanne de Salzmann]] (1899\u20131990). Alexander and Jeanne de Salzmann met Gurdjieff in Tiflis in 1919. She was originally a dancer, Dalcroze Eurythmics teacher. She was, along with Jessmin Howarth and Rose Mary Nott, responsible for transmitting Gurdjieff's choreographed movements exercises and institutionalizing Gurdjieff's teachings through the [[Gurdjieff Foundation]] of New York, the Gurdjieff Institute of Paris, London's Gurdjieff Society Inc and other groups, she established in 1953. She also established Triangle Editions in the US, which imprint claims copyright on all Gurdjieff's posthumous writings.\n\n[[John G. Bennett]] (1897\u20131974) was a British intelligence officer, polyglot (fluent in English, French, German, Turkish, Greek, Italian), technologist, industrial research director author and teacher, best known for his many books on psychology and spirituality, particularly the teachings of Gurdjieff. Bennett met both Ouspensky and then Gurdjieff at Istanbul in 1920, spent August 1923 at Gurdjieff's Institute, became Ouspensky's pupil between 1922 and 1941 and, after learning that Gurdjieff was still alive, was one of Gurdjieff's frequent visitors in Paris during 1949. See ''Witness: the Autobiography of John Bennett'' (1974), ''Gurdjieff: Making a New World''(1974), ''Idiots in Paris: diaries of J. G. Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett, 1949'' (1991).\n\n[[Alfred Richard Orage]] (1873\u20131934) was an influential British editor best known for the magazine ''New Age''. He began attending Ouspensky's London talks in 1921 then met Gurdjieff when the latter first visited London early in 1922. Shortly thereafter, Orage sold ''New Age'' and relocated to Gurdjieff's institute at the Prier\u00e9 and in 1924 was appointed by Gurdjieff to lead the institute's branch in New York. After Gurdjieff's nearly fatal automobile accident in July 1924 and because of his prolonged recuperation during 1924 and intense writing period for several years, Orage continued in New York until 1931. During this period, Orage was responsible for editing the English typescript of ''Beelzebub's Tales'' (1931) and ''Meetings with Remarkable Men'' (1963) as Gurdjieff' assistant. This period is described in some detail by Paul Beekman Tayloy in his ''Gurdjieff and Orage: Brothers in Elysium'' (2001).\n\n[[Maurice Nicoll]] (1884\u20131953) was a Harley Street psychiatrist and [[Carl Jung]]'s delegate in London. Along with Orage he attended Ouspensky's 1921 London talks where he met Gurdjieff. With his wife Catherine and their new-born daughter, he spent almost a year at Gurdjieff's Prieur\u00e9 institute. A year later, when they returned to London, Nicoll rejoined Ouspensky's group. In 1931, on Ouspensky's advice he started his own Fourth Way groups in England. He is best known for the encyclopedic six volume series of articles in ''Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky'' (Boston: Shambhala, 1996, and Samuel Weiser Inc., 1996).\n\n[[Willem Nyland]] (1890\u20131975) was a Dutch-American chemist who first met Gurdjieff early in 1924 during the latter's first visit to the US. He was a charter member of the NY branch of Gurdjieff's Institute, participated in Orage's meetings between 1924 and 1931 and was a charter member of the Gurdjieff Foundation from 1953 and through its formative years. In the early 1960s he established an independent group in Warwick NY, where he began making reel-to-reel audio recordings of his meetings which became archived in a private library of some 2600, 90 minute audio tapes. Many of these tapes have also been transcribed and indexed, but remain unpublished. ''Gurdjieff Group Work with Wilhem (sic-Willem) Nyland'' (1983) by Irmis B. Popoff, sketches Nyland's group work.\n\n[[Jane Heap]] (1883\u20131964) was an American writer, editor, artist, and publisher. She met Gurdjieff during his 1924 visit to New York, and set up a Gurdjieff study group at her apartment in Greenwich Village. In 1925, she moved to Paris to study at Gurdjieff's Institute, re-established her group in Paris until 1935 when Gurdjieff sent her to London to lead the group C. S. Nott had established and which she continued to lead until her death. Jane Heap's Paris group became Gurdjieff's 'Rope' group after her departure and contained several notable writers including, [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[Solita Solano]], [[Kathryn Hulme]] and others who proved helpful to Gurdjieff while he was editing his first two books.\n\nKenneth Macfarlane Walker (1882\u20131966) was a prominent British surgeon and prolific author. He was a member of Ouspensky's London group for decades and after the latter's death in 1947 visited Gurdjieff in Paris many times. As well as many accessible medical books for lay readers, he wrote some of the earliest informed accounts of Gurdjieff's ideas, ''Venture with Ideas'' (1951) and ''A Study of Gurdjieff's Teaching'' (1957).\n\n[[Henry John Sinclair, 2nd Baron Pentland]] (1907\u20131984) was a pupil of Ouspensky's during the 1930s and 1940s. He visited Gurdjieff regularly in Paris in 1949, then was appointed as President of the Gurdjieff Foundation of America by Jeanne de Salzmann when she founded that institution at New York in 1953. He established the Gurdjieff Foundation of California in the mid 1950s and remained President of the US Foundation branches until his death. Pentland also became President of Triangle Editions when it was established in 1974.\n\n===Responses===\n[[Louis Pauwels]], among others,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lachman |first=Gary |title=Turn off your mind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jfptmqzTzkC&pg=PA13&dq=critics+of+Gurdjieff+work#v=onepage&q=&f=false |quote=... a hostile book on...

According to Gurdjieff, everything an average person possesses, accomplishes, does, and feels is completely accidental and without any initiative. A common everyday ordinary person is born a machine and dies a machine without any chance of being anything else.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ginsburg |first=Seymour |title=Gurdjieff unveiled |page=6 |year=2005 |publisher=Lighthouse Editions Ltd |isbn=1-904998-01-1| quote=Without any doubt the human psyche and thinking are becoming more and more automatic. }}</ref> This belief seems to run counter to the Judeo-Christian tradition that man is a living soul. Gurdjieff believed that the possession of a soul (a state of psychological unity which he equated with being \"awake\") was a \"luxury\" that a disciple could attain only by the most painstaking work over a long period of time. The majority\u2014in whom the true meaning of the [[gospel]] failed to take root<ref>See The [[Parable of the Sower]]</ref>\u2014went the \"broad way\" that \"led to destruction.\"<ref>''Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.'' [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 7, 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIn ''Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson'' (see bibliography), Gurdjieff expresses his reverence for the founders of the mainstream religions of East and West and his contempt (by and large) for what successive generations of believers have made of those religious teachings. His discussions of \"orthodoxhydooraki\" and \"heterodoxhydooraki\"\u2014orthodox fools and heterodox fools, from the Russian word ''durak'' (fool)\u2014position him as a critic of religious distortion and, in turn, as a target for criticism from some within those traditions.  Gurdjieff has been interpreted by some, Ouspensky among others, to have had a total disregard for the value of mainstream religion, philanthropic work and the value of doing right or wrong in general.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P.

For example, in a written exchange between Luc Dietrich and Henri Tracol dating to 1943:  \"L.D.:  How do you know that Gurdjieff wishes you well?  H.T.:  I feel sometimes how little I interest him\u2014and how strongly he takes an interest in me.

According to Rom Landau, a journalist in the 1930s, [[Achmed Abdullah]] told him at the beginning of the 20th century that Gurdjieff was a Russian secret agent in Tibet{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to support claim|date=February 2019}} who went by the name of \"Hambro Akuan Dorzhieff\" (i.e. [[Agvan Dorjiev]]), a tutor to the [[Dalai Lama]].<ref>Gary Lachman ''Turn Off Your Mind'', pp. 32\u201333, Disinformation Co., 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-9713942-3-0}}</ref> However, the actual Dorzhieff went to live in the Buddhist temple erected in St. Petersburg and after the Revolution was imprisoned by [[Stalin]].

Daly King surmised that the problem that Gurdjieff had with Orage's teachings was that the \"Oragean Version,\" Orage himself, was not emotional enough in Gurdjieff's estimation and had not enough \"incredulity\" and faith.  King wrote that Gurdjieff did not state it as clearly and specifically as this, but was quick to add that to him, nothing Gurdjieff said was specific or clear.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAccording to [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]], the Gurdjieff system is incomplete, drawing from [[Dervish]] sources inimical to [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].  Some [[Sufi]] orders, such as the [[Naqshbandi]], draw from and are amenable to Kundalini.<ref>Osho, ''Kundalini Yoga: In Search of the Miraculous,'' volume I, p. 208, Sterling Publisher Ltd., 1997 {{ISBN|81-207-1953-0}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\nThree books by Gurdjieff were published in the English language in the United States after his death: ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]'' published in 1950 by E. P. Dutton & Co. Inc., ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', published in 1963 by E. P. Dutton & Co. Inc., and ''[[Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am'|Life is Real Only Then, When 'I Am']]'', printed privately by E. P. Dutton & Co. and published in 1978 by Triangle Editions Inc. for private distribution only. This [[trilogy]] is Gurdjieff's legominism, known collectively as ''[[All and Everything]]''. A ''legominism'' is, according to Gurdjieff, \"one of the means of transmitting information about certain events of long-past ages through initiates\". A book of his early talks was also collected by his student and personal secretary, [[Olga de Hartmann]], and published in 1973 as ''[[Views from the Real World|Views from the Real World: Early Talks in Moscow, Essentuki, Tiflis, Berlin, London, Paris, New York, and Chicago, as recollected by his pupils]]''.\n\nGurdjieff's views were initially promoted through the writings of his pupils. The best known and widely read of this is [[P. D. Ouspensky]]'s ''[[In Search of the Miraculous|In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching]]'', which is widely regard as a crucial introduction to the teaching. Others refer to Gurdjieff's own books (detailed below) as the primary texts. Numerous anecdotal accounts of time spent with Gurdjieff were published by [[Charles Stanley Nott]], [[Thomas and Olga de Hartmann]], Fritz Peters, [[Ren\u00e9 Daumal]], [[John G. Bennett]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]] and [[Louis Pauwels]], among others.\n\nThe feature film [[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|''Meetings with Remarkable Men'']] (1979), loosely based on Gurdjieff's book by the same name, ends with performances of Gurdjieff's dances taught known simply as the \"exercises\" but later  promoted as ''[[Movements (sacred dances)|movements]]''. [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] and [[Peter Brook]] wrote the film, Brook directed, and Dragan Maksimovic and [[Terence Stamp]] star, as does South African playwright and actor, [[Athol Fugard]].<ref name=\"PanafieuNeedleman1997\">{{cite book\n|last1=Panafieu\n|first1=Bruno De\n|last2=Needleman\n|first2=Jacob\n|last3=Baker\n|first3=George\n|title=Gurdjieff\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GV0dhZxB91EC&pg=PA28\n|accessdate=14 April 2011\n|date=September 1997\n|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group\n|isbn=978-0-8264-1049-8\n|pages=28\u2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\n* ''[[The Herald of Coming Good]]'' by G.
