The city has gained national recognition as an immigration destination of Canada and a model for immigrant integration in the country.<ref name=\"pop growth\"/>\n\n== History ==\n===Pre-European settlement===\nThe land in southeast Manitoba upon which Steinbach sits, was the traditional lands of the nomadic [[Ojibway]]-speaking [[Anishinabe]] people. They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the US\u2013Canada border, and both east and west of the [[Red River (Canada)|Red River]]. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed [[Treaty 1]] and moved onto reserves such as the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation|Brokenhead Indian Reserve]] and [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]] Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|title=History and Heritage of Roseau River First Nation|accessdate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205813/http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|archivedate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the [[East Reserve]] (now the [[Hanover, Manitoba|R.M. of Hanover]]).\n\n===Early history===\nSteinbach was founded in 1874 by [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]-speaking [[Russian Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title=City of Steinbach |access-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Many of Steinbach's 18 original settler families came directly from the Borosenko colony in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], now [[Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\">{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Between Earth and Sky: Steinbach, The First 50 Years |publisher = Derksen Printers |date =September 2009}}</ref>\nThey took the name \"Steinbach\" from the village they lived in there. At the time they left for Canada, Borosenko was just ten years old, an off-shoot of the larger [[Molotschna]] (or Milk River) colony. However, Russia was not their ancestral homeland. Originating in [[Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]] during the 16th century, the ancestors of Steinbach's Mennonite settlers also lived in [[Prussia]] for two centuries before their time in Ukraine.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\">{{cite web |url= http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title= Steinbach History 1874 - 1990 |date= 1 May 1990 |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Within the settlement of Molotschna were a group of people following the [[Kleine Gemeinde]], known for practise of the New Testament teachings of non-resistance, community of sharing and the publication of the first inspirational books. This group was a small minority in Molotschna but its farmers were known as the best in the community.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1873, Mennonites from Russia became dissatisfied with increasing [[Russification]] and the removal of their military exemption, and sent delegates to Canada to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. Many of the delegates decided to move their people to [[Kansas]], however, the more conservative groups, such as the Kleine Gemeinde, were persuaded to settle in Canada because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873 a [[Privilegium of 1873 (Canada)|Privilegium]] was signed, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the [[East Reserve]].<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\">{{cite book |author = Francis, E.K. |title = In Search of Utopia |publisher = D.W. Friesens and Sons |date =1955}}</ref>\n\nTwo Mennonite groups settled in the East Reserve, the [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthalers]] and [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Most of Steinbach's settlers were from Kleine Gemeinde families, who arrived late in the summer of 1874. When they arrived, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n[[File:Wind mill in Mennonite Heritage Village Steinbach Manitoba Canada 1 (5).JPG|thumb|upright|Windmill at [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] in Steinbach]]\n\nContrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a ''Wirtschaft''.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, who lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's Main Street was hacked out of thick [[Populus \u00d7 canadensis|poplar]] bush along the creek, where a [[bison]] trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach's early years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Dad, God, and Me|author=Ralph Friesen|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1875, Steinbach's spiritual leader Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jakob M. Barkman|publisher=GAMEO|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Barkman,_Jakob_M._(1824-1875)|accessdate=February 17, 2002}}</ref> The absence of religious leadership in Steinbach created a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to [[John Holdeman]] when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman's visit many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. This was the first of many [[schisms]] and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city's character.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Lord Dufferin]] toured Manitoba's new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see \"half a dozen villages\" in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> That same year, the first and original windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siamandas.com/time_machine/PAGES/more%20stories/STEINBACH.htm|title= History of Steinbach |publisher= |year= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nVarious epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping cough]], and [[diphtheria]]. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whooping cough epidemic took place in 1900.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1900 the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===End of the Strassendorf===\nIn 1910, the [[linear settlement]] village design, or Strassendorf, for the community ended.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called wirtschafts, along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater capitalist enterprise.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, built a building on the south end of the village.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the [[Kleine Gemeinde]] for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches|Bruderthaler]], who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology radically changed Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized capitalist endeavour.<ref>{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Revive Us Again: A Brief History of Revivalism in Steinbach |publisher = Preservings |date =December 2018}}</ref> Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up. Many other important and large businesses developed as well, helping to establish Steinbach as a regional service centre for the area.\n\nBy 1915, Steinbach had grown to a population of 463 and continued to attract immigrants from Europe.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Many of the new immigrants were Bergthaler Mennonites, but Steinbach also was the destination for new German and Lutheran settlers, as well as some British families who had previously settled in the Clearspring Settlement slightly to the north.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's first bank, the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]], opened in 1915.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], most Steinbach Mennonites were given an exemption from military service, as promised in the Privilegium they had agreed to upon immigration in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" /> Mistakenly considered \"ethnic Germans\", the Mennonites were caught up in the anti-German sentiment of the time and [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867-1942)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] banned Mennonites from Steinbach and other areas from voting in 1917. A year later in 1918, as soldiers returned to North America, [[Spanish flu]] struck the village, killing many.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" />\n\nAfter the war, Borden banned Mennonites and other pacifists from immigrating to Canada for three years from 1919 to 1922.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> At the same time, there was the out-migration of the more conservative Mennonites, who left the area for [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]], after the Canadian government required them to learn English and attend public schools, issues which seemed to be in violation of the Privilegium signed in 1873.<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\"/>\n\nAfter the Mennonite immigration ban was lifted in 1922 by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], a second wave of Mennonite immigration occurred due to the Russian Revolution, and many of the \"Russlander\" Mennonites took over farms and land left unoccupied by the Mennonites leaving for Latin America. During the 1920s, thousands of Mennonite refugees fled the [[Soviet Union]], many of them arriving in the Steinbach area.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book |author = Epp, Frank H. |title = Mennonite Exodus |publisher = D.W.

The same year, the last traditional Mennonite [[housebarn]] in Steinbach was torn down by car dealer (and later mayor) A.D. Penner.<ref name=reflections /> Partially in response to the destruction of heritage buildings in the area, such as the historic housebarn destroyed by A.D. Penner, residents in the 1960s saw the need to preserve and remember the Mennonite history of the region. In 1967 the [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] museum in Steinbach was opened.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the year of Manitoba's centennial, Steinbach was visited by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Charles]].<ref name=reflections/> A crowd of 10,000 waited along the streets of Steinbach as the royals visited, coming from the east along Highway 52 after their visit to [[La Broquerie, Manitoba|La Brouqerie]]. The Carillon described the visit saying, \"it was the most memorable and exciting moment in the history of the Southeast. For the first time since the earliest European settlers arrived in the 1860s and 1870s, a member of the British royal family paid a personal visit to the communities of La Broquerie, Steinbach, Sarto, [[Grunthal, Manitoba|Grunthal]] and [[St-Pierre-Jolys|St. Pierre]].

They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the US\u2013Canada border, and both east and west of the [[Red River (Canada)|Red River]]. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed [[Treaty 1]] and moved onto reserves such as the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation|Brokenhead Indian Reserve]] and [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]] Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|title=History and Heritage of Roseau River First Nation|accessdate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205813/http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|archivedate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the [[East Reserve]] (now the [[Hanover, Manitoba|R.M. of Hanover]]).\n\n===Early history===\nSteinbach was founded in 1874 by [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]-speaking [[Russian Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title=City of Steinbach |access-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Many of Steinbach's 18 original settler families came directly from the Borosenko colony in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], now [[Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\">{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Between Earth and Sky: Steinbach, The First 50 Years |publisher = Derksen Printers |date =September 2009}}</ref>\nThey took the name \"Steinbach\" from the village they lived in there. At the time they left for Canada, Borosenko was just ten years old, an off-shoot of the larger [[Molotschna]] (or Milk River) colony. However, Russia was not their ancestral homeland. Originating in [[Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]] during the 16th century, the ancestors of Steinbach's Mennonite settlers also lived in [[Prussia]] for two centuries before their time in Ukraine.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\">{{cite web |url= http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title= Steinbach History 1874 - 1990 |date= 1 May 1990 |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Within the settlement of Molotschna were a group of people following the [[Kleine Gemeinde]], known for practise of the New Testament teachings of non-resistance, community of sharing and the publication of the first inspirational books. This group was a small minority in Molotschna but its farmers were known as the best in the community.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1873, Mennonites from Russia became dissatisfied with increasing [[Russification]] and the removal of their military exemption, and sent delegates to Canada to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. Many of the delegates decided to move their people to [[Kansas]], however, the more conservative groups, such as the Kleine Gemeinde, were persuaded to settle in Canada because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873 a [[Privilegium of 1873 (Canada)|Privilegium]] was signed, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the [[East Reserve]].<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\">{{cite book |author = Francis, E.K. |title = In Search of Utopia |publisher = D.W. Friesens and Sons |date =1955}}</ref>\n\nTwo Mennonite groups settled in the East Reserve, the [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthalers]] and [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Most of Steinbach's settlers were from Kleine Gemeinde families, who arrived late in the summer of 1874. When they arrived, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n[[File:Wind mill in Mennonite Heritage Village Steinbach Manitoba Canada 1 (5).JPG|thumb|upright|Windmill at [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] in Steinbach]]\n\nContrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a ''Wirtschaft''.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, who lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's Main Street was hacked out of thick [[Populus \u00d7 canadensis|poplar]] bush along the creek, where a [[bison]] trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach's early years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Dad, God, and Me|author=Ralph Friesen|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1875, Steinbach's spiritual leader Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jakob M. Barkman|publisher=GAMEO|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Barkman,_Jakob_M._(1824-1875)|accessdate=February 17, 2002}}</ref> The absence of religious leadership in Steinbach created a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to [[John Holdeman]] when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman's visit many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. This was the first of many [[schisms]] and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city's character.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Lord Dufferin]] toured Manitoba's new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see \"half a dozen villages\" in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> That same year, the first and original windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siamandas.com/time_machine/PAGES/more%20stories/STEINBACH.htm|title= History of Steinbach |publisher= |year= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nVarious epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping cough]], and [[diphtheria]]. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whopping cough epidemic took place in 1900.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1900 the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===End of the Strassendorf===\nIn 1910, the [[linear settlement]] village design, or Strassendorf, for the community ended.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called wirtschafts, along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater capitalist enterprise.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, built a building on the south end of the village.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the [[Kleine Gemeinde]] for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches|Bruderthaler]], who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology radically changed Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized capitalist endeavour.<ref>{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Revive Us Again: A Brief History of Revivalism in Steinbach |publisher = Preservings |date =December 2018}}</ref> Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up. Many other important and large businesses developed as well, helping to establish Steinbach as a regional service centre for the area.\n\nBy 1915, Steinbach had grown to a population of 463 and continued to attract immigrants from Europe.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Many of the new immigrants were Bergthaler Mennonites, but Steinbach also was the destination for new German and Lutheran settlers, as well as some British families who had previously settled in the Clearspring Settlement slightly to the north.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's first bank, the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]], opened in 1915.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], most Steinbach Mennonites were given an exemption from military service, as promised in the Privilegium they had agreed to upon immigration in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" /> Mistakenly considered \"ethnic Germans\", the Mennonites were caught up in the anti-German sentiment of the time and [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867-1942)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] banned Mennonites from Steinbach and other areas from voting in 1917.
