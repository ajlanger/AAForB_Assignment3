In addition to Vargas's earlier goal of commercial development, the devaluation of the [[Brazilian real]] against the [[dollar]] had the result of doubling the price of [[beef]] in reals; this gave ranchers a widespread incentive to increase the size of their cattle ranches and areas under pasture for mass beef production, resulting in large areas of forest removal. Access to clear the forest was facilitated by the land tenure policy in Brazil that meant developers could proceed without restraint and install new cattle ranches, which in turn functioned as a qualification for land ownership.<ref name=mongadef>[http://www.mongabay.com/brazil.html \"Deforestation in the Amazon.\"] mongabay.com.</ref>\n\nRemoval of forest cover for cattle farming in Brazil was also seen by developers as an economic investment during periods of [[hyperinflation|high inflation]], when appreciation of cattle prices provided a way to outpace the interest earned on money left in the bank. Brazilian beef was more competitive on the world market at a time when extensive improvements in the road network in the Amazonas (such as the introduction of the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]] in the early 1970s) gave potential developers access to vast areas of previously inaccessible forest. This coincided with lower transportation costs due to cheaper fuels such as [[ethanol]], which lowered the costs of shipping the beef and further incentivized the development of remote forested areas.\n\nCattle ranching is not an environmentally friendly investment though. Cattle emit large amounts of [[methane]]. These emissions play a major role in climate change because methane's ability to trap heat is 20 times greater than that of [[carbon dioxide]] in a time horizon of 100 years and exponentially higher in shorter time horizons.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007; Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis; 2.10.2 Direct Global Warming Potentials |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{citation\n|first1=D.

Studies by the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] found that areas affected by the road network were eight times more likely to be deforested by cultivators than untouched lands, and that the roads allowed developers to increasingly exploit the forest reserves not only for pastoral production but also for wood exports and woodcutting for fuel and for construction. Developers were often given a six-month salary and substantial agricultural loans to remove the forest along roads in {{convert|250|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots for new cattle ranches.\n\nThe Brazilian government granted land to approximately 150,000 families in the Amazon between 1995 and 1998. Poor farmers were also encouraged by the government through programmes such as the [[National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform]] in Brazil (INCRA) to farm unclaimed forest land and after a five-year period were given a title and the right to sell the land. The productivity of the soil following forest removal for farming lasts only a year or two before the fields become infertile and farmers must clear new areas of forest to maintain their income. In 1995, nearly half (48%) of the deforestation in Brazil was attributed to poorer farmers clearing lots under {{convert|125|acre|km2}} in size.\n\n===Hydroelectric===\n[[Hydroelectric dam]] projects in the Amazon have also been responsible for [[flooding]] significant areas of the forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22170450/|title=MSNBC.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}{{dead link|date=November 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In particular the [[Balbina dam]] flooded approximately {{convert|2,400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of rainforest on completion, and its reservoir emitted 23,750,000 tons of [[carbon dioxide]] and 140,000 tons of [[methane]] in its first three years of operation.<ref name=mongadef/><ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Downie |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0422/In-Earth-Day-setback-Brazil-OKs-dam-that-will-flood-swath-of-Amazon/(page)/2 |title=In Earth Day setback, Brazil OKs dam that will flood swath of Amazon |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref> The construction of these dams has encouraged the construction of roads that introduce foresters, which in turn leads to deforestation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150419-amazon-dams-hydroelectric-deforestation-rivers-brazil-peru/|title=Amazon Dams Keep the Lights On But Could Hurt Fish, Forests|date=19 April 2015|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Mining activities===\nMining has also increased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly since the 1980s, with miners often clearing forest to open the mines or to provide building material, collecting wood for fuel and subsistence agriculture. In February 2017, the Brazilian government provided a reservation with a surface of {{convert|46000|sqmi}} for deforestation. The purpose of deforesting this area was to attract foreign investors for more mining activities. However, in September 2017, the government withdrew their permission.\n\n===Soybean production===\n[[File:Ronodon\u00f3polis colheita soja (Roosevelt Pinheiro) 28mar09.jpg|thumb|300px|Soybean cultivation in [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil]]\n[[Brazil]] is currently the second-largest global producer of [[soybeans]] after the United States, mostly for [[livestock]] feed. As prices for soybeans have risen, soy farmers have pushed north into the forested areas of the Amazon. As stated in the [[Constitution of Brazil]], clearing land for crops or fields is considered an \"effective use\" of land and is the first step toward land ownership.<ref name=\"Kirby, K. R. P. M\" /> Cleared property is also valued 5&ndash;10 times more than forested land, and for that reason is valuable to the owner whose ultimate objective is resale. The soy industry is an important exporter for Brazil;{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} therefore, the needs of soy farmers have been used to validate many of the controversial transportation projects being developed in the Amazon.<ref name=\" Kirby, K. R. P. M\" />\n\n[[Cargill]], a multinational company which controls the majority of the soya bean trade in Brazil, has been criticized, along with fast food chains like McDonald's, by [[Greenpeace]] for accelerating the deforestation of the Amazon. Cargill is the main supplier of soya beans to large fast food companies such as McDonald's which use the soy products to feed their cattle and chickens. As fast-food chains expand, the chains must increase the quantity of their livestock in order to produce more products. In order to meet the resulting demand for soya, Cargill has expanded its soy production by clear-cutting parts of the Amazon.<ref>Greenpeace. 2006. We're trashin' it: how McDonald's is eating up the Amazon. Amsterdam: Greenpeace.</ref>\n\nA report by Greenpeace mentions that European supermarket giant [[Tesco]] told Greenpeace that 99% of its soya footprint is made up of animal feed. This is responsible for more than 500,000 tonnes of soya imports into the UK each year, making up more than a sixth of the total.<ref>[https://www.euronews.com/living/2020/01/21/dumping-beef-for-chicken-is-killing-the-rainforest-greenpeace 'Dumping beef for chicken is killing the rainforest' - Greenpeace]</ref>\n\nThe same report by Greenpeace also mentions that animal feed for meat production is Europe\u2019s largest contribution to [[deforestation]], with soya imports representing 47% of [[European Union|Europe]]\u2019s deforestation footprint, compared to 14% for pasture expansion for livestock and 10% for palm oil.<ref>[https://www.euronews.com/living/2020/01/21/dumping-beef-for-chicken-is-killing-the-rainforest-greenpeace 'Dumping beef for chicken is killing the rainforest' - Greenpeace]</ref><ref>[https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/resources/winging-it-chicken-soya-climate-change/ Winging it: how the UK\u2019s chicken habit is fuelling the climate and nature emergency]</ref>\n\nThe first two highways, the [[Rodovia Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia]] (1958) and the [[Cuiab\u00e1]]-[[Porto Velho]] (1968), were the only federal highways in the [[Legal Amazon]] to be paved and passable year-round before the late 1990s. These two highways are said to be \"at the heart of the \u2018arc of deforestation\u2019\" that is the epicenter of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.  The [[Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia Highway]] attracted nearly two million settlers in its first twenty years. The success of the Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia highway in opening up the forest was re-enacted as paved roads continued to be developed, unleashing the irrepressible spread of settlement. The completion of the roads were followed by a wave of resettlement and the settlers had a significant effect on the forest.<ref name=\"Williams, M. 2006\"/>\n\nScientists using [[NASA]] satellite data have found that clearing for mechanized cropland has recently become a significant force in Brazilian Amazon deforestation. This change in land use may alter the region's climate and the land's ability to absorb [[carbon dioxide]]. Researchers found that in 2003, the peak year of deforestation, more than 20 percent of the [[Mato Grosso]] state's forests were converted to cropland. This finding suggests that the recent [[cropland]] expansion in the region is contributing to further deforestation. In 2005, [[soybean]] prices fell by more than 25 percent and some areas of Mato Grosso showed a decrease in large deforestation events, although the central agricultural zone continued to clear forests. But, deforestation rates could return to the high levels seen in 2003 as soybean and other crop prices begin to rebound in international markets. Brazil has become a leading worldwide producer of [[Cereal|grains]] including soybean, which accounts for 5% of the nation's exports.<ref>{{cite web|last=Simoes |first=Alexander |title=The Observatory of Economic Complexity - What does Brazil Export |url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/bra/all/show/2010/ |publisher=MIT |accessdate=22 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204013116/http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/bra/all/show/2010/ |archivedate=4 February 2014 }}</ref> This new driver of forest loss suggests that the rise and fall of prices for other crops, beef and timber may also have a significant impact on future land use in the region, according to the study.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bettwy|first1=Mike|title=Growth in Amazon Cropland May Impact Climate and Deforestation Patterns|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2006/amazon_crops.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 October 2015|ref=bettwy|location=Greenbelt, Maryland|language=en|date=19 September 2006}} Also available from [https://web.archive.org/web/20081012125024/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NasaNews/2006/2006091923131.html NASA Earth Observatory News].</ref>\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Onda Verde, 2014 (29356090146).jpg|thumb|300px|Deforestation in the state of [[Par\u00e1]]]]\n\nLogging in Brazil's Amazon is economically motivated. The economic opportunity for developing regions is driven by timber export and demand for charcoal. Charcoal-producing ovens use large amounts of timber. In one month, the Brazilian government destroyed 800 illegal ovens in [[Tail\u00e2ndia, Par\u00e1|Tail\u00e2ndia]]. These 800 ovens were estimated to consume about 23,000 trees per month.<ref>Reel, Monte.

Selective logging still does a lot of damage to the forest. For every tree harvested, 5-10 other trees are logged, to transport the logs through the forest. Also, a falling tree takes down a lot of other small trees. A logged forest contains significantly fewer species than areas where selective logging has not taken place. A forest disturbed by selective logging is also significantly more vulnerable to fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eoearth.org/article/Deforestation_in_Amazonia|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=eoearth.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nLogging in the Amazon, in theory, is controlled and only strictly licensed individuals are allowed to harvest the trees in selected areas.

Expensive wood such as mahogany is illegally exported to profit these companies. Fewer trees mean that less [[photosynthesis]] will occur and therefore [[oxygen]] levels drop. Carbon dioxide emissions increase, as this gas is released from a tree when it's cut down and burned or left to rot. A tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of [[carbon]] per year so illegal logging has a major impact on [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/treesofstrength/treefact.htm|title=Untitled Document|website=projects.ncsu.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>{{non sequitur |date=August 2019 |reason=Misunderstanding of the carbon binding effect of trees on co2 levels.

Efforts to prevent cutting down forests include payments to landowners.

[[Rain forest]]s,  of vital importance in the carbon dioxide exchange process, are second only to oceans as the most important [[carbon sink|sinks]] on the planet for absorbing the increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from industry.\n\nThe most recent survey on deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions reports that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is responsible for as much as 10% of current greenhouse gas emissions due to the removal of forest which would otherwise have absorbed the emissions, and has a clear effect on [[global warming]]. The method often used to remove the forest, where many trees are burned to the ground, emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, affecting air quality not just in Brazil but globally.\n\n[[File:DeforestationinBrazilfires.jpg|thumb|300px|A NASA satellite observation of forest fires resulting from deforestation in August 2007. The red dots represent areas of fire.]]\n\nFires intended to burn limited areas of forest to make way for allocated agricultural plots frequently get out of control and burn much more extensive areas of land than intended. Between July and October 1987, about {{convert|19,300|sqmi|km2}} of rainforest was burned in the states of [[Par\u00e1]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Rond\u00f4nia]], and [[Acre (state)|Acre]] releasing more than 500 million tons of [[carbon]], 44 million tons of [[carbon monoxide]], and millions of tons of [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other poisonous chemicals into the atmosphere.<ref>[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0809.htm \"Fires in the Rainforest\".] Mongabay.com.</ref> In 2005, forest fires in Brazil caused widespread disruptions across the Amazon region, including airport closures and hospitalizations for [[smoke inhalation]].\n\nCarbon present in the trees is essential for ecosystem development and plays a key role in the regional and global climate. Fallen leaves from deforestation leave behind a mass of dead plant material known as slash, which on decomposition provides a food source for invertebrates. This has the indirect effect of increasing atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] levels through [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and microbial activity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Wolfe, Earth Observatory |url=http://eobglossary.gsfc.nasa.gov/Study/recovery/ |title=The Road to Recovery |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2007-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151726/http://eobglossary.gsfc.nasa.gov/Study/recovery/ |archivedate=2008-05-11 }}</ref> Simultaneously the organic carbon in the soil structure becomes depleted; the presence of carbon plays a vital role in the functioning of life in any ecosystem.\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nThe Brazilian rainforest is one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world. Over a million species of plants and animals are known to live in the Amazon and many millions of species are unclassified or unknown. With rapid deforestation, the [[habitat]]s of many animals and plants are under threat and some species may face extinction. Deforestation reduces the [[gene pool]]; there is less of the [[genetic variation]] needed to adapt to climate change in the future. The Brazilian Amazon is known to possess vast resources for medicine and scientific research in the basin has been conducted to find a cure for major global killers such as [[AIDS]], [[cancer]], and other terminal diseases.\n\nRainforests are the oldest ecosystems on earth. Rainforest plants and animals continue to evolve, developing into the most diverse and complex ecosystems on earth. Living in limited areas, most of these species are endemic, found nowhere else in the world. In tropical rainforests, an estimated 90% of the species of the ecosystem live in the canopy. Since tropical rainforests are estimated to hold 50% of the planet's species, the canopy of rainforests worldwide may hold 45% of life on Earth. The Amazon rainforest borders eight countries, and has the world's largest river basin and is the source of 1/5 of the Earth's river water. It has the world's greatest diversity of birds and freshwater fish. The Amazon is home to more species of plants and animals than any other terrestrial ecosystem on the planet\u2014perhaps 30% of the world's species are found there.\n\nMore than 300 species of mammals are found in the Amazon, the majority of them bats and rodents. The Amazon basin contains more freshwater fish species than anywhere else in the world\u2014more than 3,000 species. More than 1,500 bird species are also found there. Frogs are overwhelmingly the most abundant amphibians in the rainforest. Species interdependence takes many forms in the forest, from species relying on other species for pollination and seed dispersal to predator-prey relationships and symbiotic relationships. Each species that disappears from the ecosystem may weaken the survival chances of another, while the loss of a [[keystone species]]\u2014an organism that links many other species together\u2014could cause a significant disruption in the functioning of the entire system.\n\n[[File:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Hymenaea, Julho-2016 (29399454651).jpg|thumb|300px|Deforestation in the state of [[Maranh\u00e3o]]]]\n\n=== Indigenous people ===\nForest removal affects the social and economic lives of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] who live in the forests and whose families have lived there in relative isolation for many centuries. These indigenous peoples, like the [[Kayapo]], have an intimate understanding of the [[ecology]] of the Amazon.<ref>http://web.nateko.lu.se/courses/ngen03/posey-1985.pdf</ref> The subsequent loss of these people may also prove to be a loss of knowledge.

If too much timber is cut, soil that once had sufficient cover can get baked and dry out in the sun, leading to erosion and degradation of soil fertility; this means farmers cannot profit from their land even after clearing it. According to the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) in 1977, deforestation is a major cause of desertification and in 1980 threatened 35% of the world's land surface and 20% of the world's population.\n\n=== Pollution ===\nExploitation of forests for mining activities such as [[gold mining]] has also significantly increased the risk of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] poisoning and contamination of the ecosystem and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/271598.stm|title=Mercury poisoning disease re-emerges|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> [[Mercury poisoning]] can affect the [[food chain]] and affect [[wildlife]] both on land and in the rivers. It can also affect plants and the crops of farmers trying to farm forest areas. Pollution may result from mine sludge and affect the functioning of the river system when exposed soil is blown in the wind and can have a significant impact on aquatic populations further affected by [[dam]] building in the region. Dams may have a profound impact on migrating fish and ecological life and leave plains prone to flooding and [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]].\n\nIn August 2019, smoke from [[2019 Brazil wildfires|wildfires in Brazil's rainforests]] became so thick that it arrived in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and plunged the city into darkness in the middle of the day for an hour, prompting the spread of the hashtag \"prayforamazonia\" on social media.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bramwell |first1=Kris |title=Brazil fires prompt 'prayers' for Amazon rainforest |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49406519 |accessdate=22 August 2019 |agency=BBC |date=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Water supply ===\nThe deforestation of the Amazon has already had a significant negative impact on Brazil's freshwater supply, harming, among others, the [[agriculture in Brazil|agricultural industry]] that has contributed to the clearing of the forests.

More massive deforestation could alter water supplies as far away as Africa or California.<ref name=\"trees\"/><ref name=\"NGeo\"/>\n\nAs of 2020 deforestation in Brazil is close to reach a tipping point after which the forest will change to savanna. The result of passing such tipping point will be catastrophic for the [[agriculture in Brazil|agriculture]] and hydroelectricity in Brazil. Already both sectors are severely hurt. For example the rainy season has been shortened by 15 - 30 days in 40 years, the amount of rainfall decreased, the harvest became lower in many areas, the mega dam Belo Monte can produce less power. In the future, the soya sector can lose 40% of productivity even in areas with low risk, the hydroelectric sector more than 80%. The lack of water can cause water conflict between the different sectors of the economy. Also passing the tipping point will hurt global food security.\n\nCarlos Nobres a climate scientist say: \u201cBrazil should be battling the most [to protect the Amazon], because it has the most to lose,\u201d.

They wrote: \"Increased temperatures in already hot locations may increase [[Mortality rate|human mortality rates]] and [[electricity demand]]s, reduce [[agricultural yield]]s and [[water resources]], and contribute to [[Biodiversity|biodiversity collapse]], particularly in tropical regions. Furthermore, local warming may cause shifts in species distributions, including for species involved in [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease transmissions]].\" The authors of the paper say that deforestation is already causing a rise in the temperature.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=A.

In comparison with areas still unaffected by deforestation, they found a significant increase in cloud cover and [[rainfall]] during the August\u2013September [[wet season]] where the forest had been cleared. The height or existence of plants and trees in the forest directly affects the [[aerodynamics]] of the [[atmosphere]], and [[precipitation]] in the area. In addition, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] developed a series of detailed computer simulation models of rainfall patterns in the Amazon during the 1990s and concluded that forest removal also leaves soil exposed to the sun, and the increased temperature on the surface enhances [[evaporation]] and increases moisture in the air.\n\n==Measured rates==\n[[File: Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|300px|The zig-zag patterns across the road resulting from deforestation in Brazil can be seen from space.]]\n[[File:NASAAmazonforestchart.gif|thumb|300px|A deforestation chart.

By 2009, deforestation had fallen to around 7,000 square kilometers per year, a decline of nearly 75 percent from 2004, according to Brazil's [[National Institute for Space Research]] (''Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais'', or INPE),<ref name = \"INPE 2010\">National Institute for Space Research (INPE) (2010)</ref> which produces deforestation figures annually.\n\nTheir deforestation estimates are derived from 100 to 220 images taken during the dry season in the Amazon by the [[China\u2013Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]] (CBS), and may only consider the loss of the Amazon rainforest \u2013 not the loss of natural fields or savanna within the [[Amazon biome]].

At the 1992 [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]], deforestation became a key issue addressed at the summit in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

In addition to Vargas's earlier goal of commercial development, the devaluation of the [[Brazilian real]] against the [[dollar]] had the result of doubling the price of [[beef]] in reals; this gave ranchers a widespread incentive to increase the size of their cattle ranches and areas under pasture for mass beef production, resulting in large areas of forest removal. Access to clear the forest was facilitated by the land tenure policy in Brazil that meant developers could proceed without restraint and install new cattle ranches, which in turn functioned as a qualification for land ownership.<ref name=mongadef>[http://www.mongabay.com/brazil.html \"Deforestation in the Amazon.\"] mongabay.com.</ref>\n\nRemoval of forest cover for cattle farming in Brazil was also seen by developers as an economic investment during periods of [[hyperinflation|high inflation]], when appreciation of cattle prices provided a way to outpace the interest earned on money left in the bank. Brazilian beef was more competitive on the world market at a time when extensive improvements in the road network in the Amazonas (such as the introduction of the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]] in the early 1970s) gave potential developers access to vast areas of previously inaccessible forest. This coincided with lower transportation costs due to cheaper fuels such as [[ethanol]], which lowered the costs of shipping the beef and further incentivized the development of remote forested areas.\n\nCattle ranching is not an environmentally friendly investment though. Cattle emit large amounts of [[methane]]. These emissions play a major role in climate change because methane's ability to trap heat is 20 times greater than that of [[carbon dioxide]] in a time horizon of 100 years and exponentially higher in shorter time horizons.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007; Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis; 2.10.2 Direct Global Warming Potentials |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{citation\n|first1=D.

Studies by the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] found that areas affected by the road network were eight times more likely to be deforested by cultivators than untouched lands, and that the roads allowed developers to increasingly exploit the forest reserves not only for pastoral production but also for wood exports and woodcutting for fuel and for construction. Developers were often given a six-month salary and substantial agricultural loans to remove the forest along roads in {{convert|250|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots for new cattle ranches.\n\nThe Brazilian government granted land to approximately 150,000 families in the Amazon between 1995 and 1998. Poor farmers were also encouraged by the government through programmes such as the [[National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform]] in Brazil (INCRA) to farm unclaimed forest land and after a five-year period were given a title and the right to sell the land. The productivity of the soil following forest removal for farming lasts only a year or two before the fields become infertile and farmers must clear new areas of forest to maintain their income. In 1995, nearly half (48%) of the deforestation in Brazil was attributed to poorer farmers clearing lots under {{convert|125|acre|km2}} in size.\n\n===Hydroelectric===\n[[Hydroelectric dam]] projects in the Amazon have also been responsible for [[flooding]] significant areas of the forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22170450/|title=MSNBC.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}{{dead link|date=November 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In particular the [[Balbina dam]] flooded approximately {{convert|2,400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of rainforest on completion, and its reservoir emitted 23,750,000 tons of [[carbon dioxide]] and 140,000 tons of [[methane]] in its first three years of operation.<ref name=mongadef/><ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Downie |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0422/In-Earth-Day-setback-Brazil-OKs-dam-that-will-flood-swath-of-Amazon/(page)/2 |title=In Earth Day setback, Brazil OKs dam that will flood swath of Amazon |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref> The construction of these dams has encouraged the construction of roads that introduce foresters, which in turn leads to deforestation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150419-amazon-dams-hydroelectric-deforestation-rivers-brazil-peru/|title=Amazon Dams Keep the Lights On But Could Hurt Fish, Forests|date=19 April 2015|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Mining activities===\nMining has also increased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly since the 1980s, with miners often clearing forest to open the mines or to provide building material, collecting wood for fuel and subsistence agriculture. In February 2017, the Brazilian government provided a reservation with a surface of {{convert|46000|sqmi}} for deforestation. The purpose of deforesting this area was to attract foreign investors for more mining activities. However, in September 2017, the government withdrew their permission.\n\n===Soybean production===\n[[File:Ronodon\u00f3polis colheita soja (Roosevelt Pinheiro) 28mar09.jpg|thumb|300px|Soybean cultivation in [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil]]\n[[Brazil]] is currently the second-largest global producer of [[soybeans]] after the United States, mostly for [[livestock]] feed. As prices for soybeans have risen, soy farmers have pushed north into the forested areas of the Amazon. As stated in the [[Constitution of Brazil]], clearing land for crops or fields is considered an \"effective use\" of land and is the first step toward land ownership.<ref name=\"Kirby, K. R. P. M\" /> Cleared property is also valued 5&ndash;10 times more than forested land, and for that reason is valuable to the owner whose ultimate objective is resale. The soy industry is an important exporter for Brazil;{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} therefore, the needs of soy farmers have been used to validate many of the controversial transportation projects being developed in the Amazon.<ref name=\" Kirby, K. R. P. M\" />\n\n[[Cargill]], a multinational company which controls the majority of the soya bean trade in Brazil, has been criticized, along with fast food chains like McDonald's, by [[Greenpeace]] for accelerating the deforestation of the Amazon. Cargill is the main supplier of soya beans to large fast food companies such as McDonald's which use the soy products to feed their cattle and chickens. As fast-food chains expand, the chains must increase the quantity of their livestock in order to produce more products. In order to meet the resulting demand for soya, Cargill has expanded its soy production by clear-cutting parts of the Amazon.<ref>Greenpeace. 2006. We're trashin' it: how McDonald's is eating up the Amazon. Amsterdam: Greenpeace.</ref>\n\nA report by Greenpeace mentions that European supermarket giant [[Tesco]] told Greenpeace that 99% of its soya footprint is made up of animal feed.

These two highways are said to be \"at the heart of the \u2018arc of deforestation\u2019\" that is the epicenter of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.  The [[Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia Highway]] attracted nearly two million settlers in its first twenty years. The success of the Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia highway in opening up the forest was re-enacted as paved roads continued to be developed, unleashing the irrepressible spread of settlement. The completion of the roads were followed by a wave of resettlement and the settlers had a significant effect on the forest.<ref name=\"Williams, M. 2006\"/>\n\nScientists using [[NASA]] satellite data have found that clearing for mechanized cropland has recently become a significant force in Brazilian Amazon deforestation. This change in land use may alter the region's climate and the land's ability to absorb [[carbon dioxide]]. Researchers found that in 2003, the peak year of deforestation, more than 20 percent of the [[Mato Grosso]] state's forests were converted to cropland. This finding suggests that the recent [[cropland]] expansion in the region is contributing to further deforestation. In 2005, [[soybean]] prices fell by more than 25 percent and some areas of Mato Grosso showed a decrease in large deforestation events, although the central agricultural zone continued to clear forests. But, deforestation rates could return to the high levels seen in 2003 as soybean and other crop prices begin to rebound in international markets. Brazil has become a leading worldwide producer of [[Cereal|grains]] including soybean, which accounts for 5% of the nation's exports.<ref>{{cite web|last=Simoes |first=Alexander |title=The Observatory of Economic Complexity - What does Brazil Export |url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/bra/all/show/2010/ |publisher=MIT |accessdate=22 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204013116/http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/bra/all/show/2010/ |archivedate=4 February 2014 }}</ref> This new driver of forest loss suggests that the rise and fall of prices for other crops, beef and timber may also have a significant impact on future land use in the region, according to the study.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bettwy|first1=Mike|title=Growth in Amazon Cropland May Impact Climate and Deforestation Patterns|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2006/amazon_crops.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 October 2015|ref=bettwy|location=Greenbelt, Maryland|language=en|date=19 September 2006}} Also available from [https://web.archive.org/web/20081012125024/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NasaNews/2006/2006091923131.html NASA Earth Observatory News].</ref>\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Onda Verde, 2014 (29356090146).jpg|thumb|300px|Deforestation in the state of [[Par\u00e1]]]]\n\nLogging in Brazil's Amazon is economically motivated. The economic opportunity for developing regions is driven by timber export and demand for charcoal. Charcoal-producing ovens use large amounts of timber. In one month, the Brazilian government destroyed 800 illegal ovens in [[Tail\u00e2ndia, Par\u00e1|Tail\u00e2ndia]]. These 800 ovens were estimated to consume about 23,000 trees per month.<ref>Reel, Monte.

Selective logging still does a lot of damage to the forest. For every tree harvested, 5-10 other trees are logged, to transport the logs through the forest. Also, a falling tree takes down a lot of other small trees. A logged forest contains significantly fewer species than areas where selective logging has not taken place. A forest disturbed by selective logging is also significantly more vulnerable to fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eoearth.org/article/Deforestation_in_Amazonia|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=eoearth.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nLogging in the Amazon, in theory, is controlled and only strictly licensed individuals are allowed to harvest the trees in selected areas.

Expensive wood such as mahogany is illegally exported to profit these companies. Fewer trees mean that less [[photosynthesis]] will occur and therefore [[oxygen]] levels drop. Carbon dioxide emissions increase, as this gas is released from a tree when it's cut down and burned or left to rot. A tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of [[carbon]] per year so illegal logging has a major impact on [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/treesofstrength/treefact.htm|title=Untitled Document|website=projects.ncsu.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>{{non sequitur |date=August 2019 |reason=Misunderstanding of the carbon binding effect of trees on co2 levels.

Efforts to prevent cutting down forests include payments to landowners.

[[Rain forest]]s,  of vital importance in the carbon dioxide exchange process, are second only to oceans as the most important [[carbon sink|sinks]] on the planet for absorbing the increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from industry.\n\nThe most recent survey on deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions reports that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is responsible for as much as 10% of current greenhouse gas emissions due to the removal of forest which would otherwise have absorbed the emissions, and has a clear effect on [[global warming]]. The method often used to remove the forest, where many trees are burned to the ground, emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, affecting air quality not just in Brazil but globally.\n\n[[File:DeforestationinBrazilfires.jpg|thumb|300px|A NASA satellite observation of forest fires resulting from deforestation in August 2007. The red dots represent areas of fire.]]\n\nFires intended to burn limited areas of forest to make way for allocated agricultural plots frequently get out of control and burn much more extensive areas of land than intended. Between July and October 1987, about {{convert|19,300|sqmi|km2}} of rainforest was burned in the states of [[Par\u00e1]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Rond\u00f4nia]], and [[Acre (state)|Acre]] releasing more than 500 million tons of [[carbon]], 44 million tons of [[carbon monoxide]], and millions of tons of [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other poisonous chemicals into the atmosphere.<ref>[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0809.htm \"Fires in the Rainforest\".] Mongabay.com.</ref> In 2005, forest fires in Brazil caused widespread disruptions across the Amazon region, including airport closures and hospitalizations for [[smoke inhalation]].\n\nCarbon present in the trees is essential for ecosystem development and plays a key role in the regional and global climate. Fallen leaves from deforestation leave behind a mass of dead plant material known as slash, which on decomposition provides a food source for invertebrates. This has the indirect effect of increasing atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] levels through [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and microbial activity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Wolfe, Earth Observatory |url=http://eobglossary.gsfc.nasa.gov/Study/recovery/ |title=The Road to Recovery |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2007-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151726/http://eobglossary.gsfc.nasa.gov/Study/recovery/ |archivedate=2008-05-11 }}</ref> Simultaneously the organic carbon in the soil structure becomes depleted; the presence of carbon plays a vital role in the functioning of life in any ecosystem.\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nThe Brazilian rainforest is one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world. Over a million species of plants and animals are known to live in the Amazon and many millions of species are unclassified or unknown. With rapid deforestation, the [[habitat]]s of many animals and plants are under threat and some species may face extinction. Deforestation reduces the [[gene pool]]; there is less of the [[genetic variation]] needed to adapt to climate change in the future. The Brazilian Amazon is known to possess vast resources for medicine and scientific research in the basin has been conducted to find a cure for major global killers such as [[AIDS]], [[cancer]], and other terminal diseases.\n\nRainforests are the oldest ecosystems on earth. Rainforest plants and animals continue to evolve, developing into the most diverse and complex ecosystems on earth. Living in limited areas, most of these species are endemic, found nowhere else in the world. In tropical rainforests, an estimated 90% of the species of the ecosystem live in the canopy. Since tropical rainforests are estimated to hold 50% of the planet's species, the canopy of rainforests worldwide may hold 45% of life on Earth. The Amazon rainforest borders eight countries, and has the world's largest river basin and is the source of 1/5 of the Earth's river water. It has the world's greatest diversity of birds and freshwater fish. The Amazon is home to more species of plants and animals than any other terrestrial ecosystem on the planet\u2014perhaps 30% of the world's species are found there.\n\nMore than 300 species of mammals are found in the Amazon, the majority of them bats and rodents. The Amazon basin contains more freshwater fish species than anywhere else in the world\u2014more than 3,000 species. More than 1,500 bird species are also found there. Frogs are overwhelmingly the most abundant amphibians in the rainforest. Species interdependence takes many forms in the forest, from species relying on other species for pollination and seed dispersal to predator-prey relationships and symbiotic relationships. Each species that disappears from the ecosystem may weaken the survival chances of another, while the loss of a [[keystone species]]\u2014an organism that links many other species together\u2014could cause a significant disruption in the functioning of the entire system.\n\n[[File:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Hymenaea, Julho-2016 (29399454651).jpg|thumb|300px|Deforestation in the state of [[Maranh\u00e3o]]]]\n\n=== Indigenous people ===\nForest removal affects the social and economic lives of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] who live in the forests and whose families have lived there in relative isolation for many centuries. These indigenous peoples, like the [[Kayapo]], have an intimate understanding of the [[ecology]] of the Amazon.<ref>http://web.nateko.lu.se/courses/ngen03/posey-1985.pdf</ref> The subsequent loss of these people may also prove to be a loss of knowledge. The rainforest is their home, and a fundamental source of [[food]], shelter, [[fuel]], [[nourishment]], cultural heritage, and recreation.\n\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more. It says that \ntenure-secure indigenous lands have low deforestation rates,<ref>[https://www.wri.org/blog/2016/10/protecting-indigenous-land-rights-makes-good-economic-sense Protecting Indigenous Land Rights Makes Good Economic Sense]</ref><ref>[https://www.wri.org/publication/climate-benefits-tenure-costs Climate Benefits, Tenure Costs]</ref> they help to reduce GHG emissions, control erosion and flooding by anchoring soil, and provide a suite of other local, regional and global \u201c[[ecosystem services]].\u201d\nHowever, many of these communities find themselves on the front lines of the deforestation crisis, and their lives and livelihoods threatened.<ref>[https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/defending-defenders-tropical-forests-front-line Defending the defenders: tropical forests in the front line]</ref><ref>[https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/2018/04/protect-indigenous-peoples-land/ Protect indigenous people\u2019s land rights and the whole world will benefit]</ref><ref>[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/05/what-role-do-indigenous-people-and-forests-have-in-a-sustainable-future/ What role do indigenous people and forests have in a sustainable future?]</ref>\n\n=== Land degradation ===\nDeforestation for the export of [[timber]] removes valuable protection for the [[soil]]s in a dynamic ecosystem; thus regions are prone to [[desertification]] and [[silting]] of river banks as rivers become clogged with [[erosion|eroded]] soils in sparse areas. If too much timber is cut, soil that once had sufficient cover can get baked and dry out in the sun, leading to erosion and degradation of soil fertility; this means farmers cannot profit from their land even after clearing it. According to the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) in 1977, deforestation is a major cause of desertification and in 1980 threatened 35% of the world's land surface and 20% of the world's population.\n\n=== Pollution ===\nExploitation of forests for mining activities such as [[gold mining]] has also significantly increased the risk of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] poisoning and contamination of the ecosystem and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/271598.stm|title=Mercury poisoning disease re-emerges|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> [[Mercury poisoning]] can affect the [[food chain]] and affect [[wildlife]] both on land and in the rivers. It can also affect plants and the crops of farmers trying to farm forest areas. Pollution may result from mine sludge and affect the functioning of the river system when exposed soil is blown in the wind and can have a significant impact on aquatic populations further affected by [[dam]] building in the region. Dams may have a profound impact on migrating fish and ecological life and leave plains prone to flooding and [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]].\n\nIn August 2019, smoke from [[2019 Brazil wildfires|wildfires in Brazil's rainforests]] became so thick that it arrived in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and plunged the city into darkness in the middle of the day for an hour, prompting the spread of the hashtag \"prayforamazonia\" on social media.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bramwell |first1=Kris |title=Brazil fires prompt 'prayers' for Amazon rainforest |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49406519 |accessdate=22 August 2019 |agency=BBC |date=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Water supply ===\nThe deforestation of the Amazon has already had a significant negative impact on Brazil's freshwater supply, harming, among others, the [[agriculture in Brazil|agricultural industry]] that has contributed to the clearing of the forests.

More massive deforestation could alter water supplies as far away as Africa or California.<ref name=\"trees\"/><ref name=\"NGeo\"/>\n\nAs of 2020 deforestation in Brazil is close to reach a tipping point after which the forest will change to savanna. The result of passing such tipping point will be catastrophic for the [[agriculture in Brazil|agriculture]] and hydroelectricity in Brazil. Already both sectors are severely hurt. For example the rainy season has been shortened by 15 - 30 days in 40 years, the amount of rainfall decreased, the harvest became lower in many areas, the mega dam Belo Monte can produce less power. In the future, the soya sector can lose 40% of productivity even in areas with low risk, the hydroelectric sector more than 80%. The lack of water can cause water conflict between the different sectors of the economy. Also passing the tipping point will hurt global food security.\n\nCarlos Nobres a climate scientist say: \u201cBrazil should be battling the most [to protect the Amazon], because it has the most to lose,\u201d. Experts note that avoiding deforestation and climate change is a top interest of the agricultural sector because it existance depending on it.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hanbury |first1=Shanna |title=Amazon Tipping Point puts Brazil\u2019s agribusiness, energy sector at risk: Top scientists |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2020/02/amazon-tipping-point-puts-brazils-agribusiness-energy-sector-at-risk-top-scientists/ |accessdate=12 March 2020 |agency=Mongabay |date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n=== Impact on local temperature ===\nIn 2019, a group of scientists published research suggesting that in a \"business as usual\" scenario, the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest would raise the temperature in Brazil by 1.45 degrees. They wrote: \"Increased temperatures in already hot locations may increase [[Mortality rate|human mortality rates]] and [[electricity demand]]s, reduce [[agricultural yield]]s and [[water resources]], and contribute to [[Biodiversity|biodiversity collapse]], particularly in tropical regions. Furthermore, local warming may cause shifts in species distributions, including for species involved in [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease transmissions]].\" The authors of the paper say that deforestation is already causing a rise in the temperature.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=A.

In comparison with areas still unaffected by deforestation, they found a significant increase in cloud cover and [[rainfall]] during the August\u2013September [[wet season]] where the forest had been cleared. The height or existence of plants and trees in the forest directly affects the [[aerodynamics]] of the [[atmosphere]], and [[precipitation]] in the area. In addition, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] developed a series of detailed computer simulation models of rainfall patterns in the Amazon during the 1990s and concluded that forest removal also leaves soil exposed to the sun, and the increased temperature on the surface enhances [[evaporation]] and increases moisture in the air.\n\n==Measured rates==\n[[File: Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|300px|The zig-zag patterns across the road resulting from deforestation in Brazil can be seen from space.]]\n[[File:NASAAmazonforestchart.gif|thumb|300px|A deforestation chart.

By 2009, deforestation had fallen to around 7,000 square kilometers per year, a decline of nearly 75 percent from 2004, according to Brazil's [[National Institute for Space Research]] (''Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais'', or INPE),<ref name = \"INPE 2010\">National Institute for Space Research (INPE) (2010)</ref> which produces deforestation figures annually.\n\nTheir deforestation estimates are derived from 100 to 220 images taken during the dry season in the Amazon by the [[China\u2013Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]] (CBS), and may only consider the loss of the Amazon rainforest \u2013 not the loss of natural fields or savanna within the [[Amazon biome]].

The competing proposal for the REDD issue was a carbon emission credit system, where reduced deforestation would receive \"marketable emissions credits\". In effect, developed countries could reduce their carbon emissions, and approach their emissions quota by investing in the reforestation of developing rainforest countries. Instead, Brazil's 2006 proposal would draw from a fund based on donor country contributors.<ref name=monga1/>\n\nBy 2005 forest removal had fallen to {{convert|9,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of forest compared to {{convert|18,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2003<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|author=Tony Gibb, BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4189792.stm|title=Deforestation of Amazon halved |work=BBC.co.uk|date=2006-08-26|accessdate=2007-11-27}}</ref> and on July 5, 2007, Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva announced at the International Conference on Biofuels in [[Brussels]] that more than 20 million hectares of conservation units to protect the forest and more efficient fuel production had allowed the rate of deforestation to fall by 52% in the three years since 2004.<ref name=\"brazil.org.uk\">{{cite web |author=Embassy of Brazil in London |url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/press/speeches_files/20070705.html |title=President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva - International Conference on Biofuels |publisher=Brazil.org |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2009-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604002118/http://www.brazil.org.uk/press/speeches_files/20070705.html |archivedate=2010-06-04 }}</ref>\n\nDaniel Nepstad of the [[Woods Hole Research Center]] has demonstrated that Brazil's deforestation rates have been cut nearly in half in recent years through a combination of government intervention and economic trends.
