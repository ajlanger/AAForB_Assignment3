According to Dr. Nadia Nikitenko, a historian who has studied the cathedral for 30 years, the cathedral was founded in 1011, under the reign of Yaroslav's father, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus', [[Vladimir the Great]]. This has been accepted by both UNESCO and Ukraine, which officially celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the cathedral during 2011.<ref>Booklet \"The Millenary of St. Sophia of Kyiv\" by Nadia Nikitenko, Kiev 2011</ref>) The structure has 5 [[nave]]s, 5 [[apse]]s, and (quite surprisingly for [[Byzantine architecture]]) 13 [[cupola]]s. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring {{convert|37|to|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the exterior used to be faced with [[plinth]]s. On the inside, it retains [[mosaics]] and [[fresco]]s from the 11th century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the [[Orans]].\n\nOriginally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including [[Vladimir Monomakh]], [[Vsevolod Yaroslavich]] and the cathedral's founder [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], although only the latter's grave survived to this day (see [[:Image:Yaroslavtomb.jpg|picture]]).\n\nAfter the pillaging of Kiev by [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in 1169, followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian Tatars]] in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. It was also greatly damaged in the 16th century when Poland and Ukraine were trying to unite Catholic and Orthodox churches. At this period the Cathedral was almost ruined: its roof decayed and a lot of wall paintings had gone.\nFollowing the 1595-96 [[Union of Brest]], the Cathedral of Holy Sophia belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] until it was claimed by the Moldavian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[Peter Mogila]] (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect [[Octaviano Mancini]] in the distinct [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the [[Cossack]] [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]] until 1767. During this period around Holy Sophia Cathedral a bell tower, a monastery canteen, a bakery, a \"House of Metropolitan\", the western gates (Zborovsky gates), a Monastic Inn, a Brotherhood campus and a bursa (seminary) were all erected. All of these buildings, as well as the Cathedral after the reconstruction, have distinctive features of Ukrainian Baroque.\n\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and during the Soviet anti-religious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park \"Heroes of [[Perekop]]\" (after a [[Red Army]] victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] in [[Crimea]]). The cathedral was saved from destruction<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/109648/ Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv], [[Kyiv Post]] (28 July 2011)</ref> (the opposite [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] was destroyed in 1935<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\"/>) primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding 17th\u201318th-century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.\n\nSince the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|schisms, and factions]] within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, at other times they are denied access. A severe incident was the funeral of [[Patriarch Volodymyr]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] in 1995 when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a secular museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.\n\nOn 21 August 2007, the Holy Sophia Cathedral was named one of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]], based on votes by experts and the internet community.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=210 | lines=5\n|align=center\n|File:Oranta-Kyiv.jpg|The Virgin [[Orans]], c. 1000\n|file: Church Fathers Order (left part) - Google Art Project.jpg|Church Fathers Order, c. 1000\n|file: The Deesis - Google Art Project.jpg|The Deesis, 1000\n|file: Princely group portrait.

According to Dr. Nadia Nikitenko, a historian who has studied the cathedral for 30 years, the cathedral was founded in 1011, under the reign of Yaroslav's father, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus', [[Vladimir the Great]]. This has been accepted by both UNESCO and Ukraine, which officially celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the cathedral during 2011.<ref>Booklet \"The Millenary of St. Sophia of Kyiv\" by Nadia Nikitenko, Kiev 2011</ref>) The structure has 5 [[nave]]s, 5 [[apse]]s, and (quite surprisingly for [[Byzantine architecture]]) 13 [[cupola]]s. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring {{convert|37|to|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the exterior used to be faced with [[plinth]]s. On the inside, it retains [[mosaics]] and [[fresco]]s from the 11th century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the [[Orans]].\n\nOriginally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including [[Vladimir Monomakh]], [[Vsevolod Yaroslavich]] and the cathedral's founder [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], although only the latter's grave survived to this day (see [[:Image:Yaroslavtomb.jpg|picture]]).\n\nAfter the pillaging of Kiev by [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in 1169, followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian Tatars]] in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. It was also greatly damaged in the 16th century when Poland and Ukraine were trying to unite Catholic and Orthodox churches. At this period the Cathedral was almost ruined: its roof decayed and a lot of wall paintings had gone.\nFollowing the 1595-96 [[Union of Brest]], the Cathedral of Holy Sophia belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] until it was claimed by the Moldavian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[Peter Mogila]] (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect [[Octaviano Mancini]] in the distinct [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the [[Cossack]] [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]] until 1767. During this period around Holy Sophia Cathedral a bell tower, a monastery canteen, a bakery, a \"House of Metropolitan\", the western gates (Zborovsky gates), a Monastic Inn, a Brotherhood campus and a bursa (seminary) were all erected. All of these buildings, as well as the Cathedral after the reconstruction, have distinctive features of Ukrainian Baroque.\n\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and during the Soviet anti-religious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park \"Heroes of [[Perekop]]\" (after a [[Red Army]] victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] in [[Crimea]]). The cathedral was saved from destruction<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/109648/ Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv], [[Kyiv Post]] (28 July 2011)</ref> (the opposite [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] was destroyed in 1935<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\"/>) primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding 17th\u201318th-century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.\n\nSince the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|schisms, and factions]] within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, at other times they are denied access. A severe incident was the funeral of [[Patriarch Volodymyr]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] in 1995 when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a secular museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.\n\nOn 21 August 2007, the Holy Sophia Cathedral was named one of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]], based on votes by experts and the internet community.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=210 | lines=5\n|align=center\n|File:Oranta-Kyiv.jpg|The Virgin [[Orans]], c. 1000\n|file: Church Fathers Order (left part) - Google Art Project.jpg|Church Fathers Order, c. 1000\n|file: The Deesis - Google Art Project.jpg|The Deesis, 1000\n|file: Princely group portrait.
