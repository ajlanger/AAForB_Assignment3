A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, is said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a [[community]]. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with [[Subculture|underground culture]], and are considered too [[:wikt:eccentric|eccentric]] or [[anti-establishment|subversive]] to be appreciated by the [[general public]] or to be commercially successful.\n\nMany cult fans express their devotion with a level of irony when describing entertainment that falls under this realm, in that something is so bad, it's good. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to [[camp (style)|camp]] followings. Fans may become involved in a [[subculture]] of [[fandom]], either via [[Fan convention|conventions]], [[online communities]] or through activities such as writing [[Fan fiction|series-related fiction]], costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cult.tv |title=The Official Cult TV Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Film===\n{{main|Cult film}}\nThere is not always a clear difference between cult and [[mainstream]] media. Series such as ''[[Star Trek (film series)|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror]]'', ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[Ethel & Ernest (film)|Ethel & Ernest]]'', ''[[Batman in film#The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005\u20132012)|The Dark Knight]]'', and ''[[Mean Girls]]'' attract mass audiences but also have core groups of fanatical followers. Professors Xavier Mendik and Ernest Mathijs, authors of ''[[100 Cult Films]]'', argue that the devoted following among these films make them cult classics. In many cases, films that have cult followings may have been financial flops during their theatrical box office run, and even received mixed or mostly negative reviews by mainstream media, but still be considered a major success by small core groups or communities of fans devoted to such films.\n\nSome cults are only popular within a certain [[subculture]]. The film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1969) is especially loved within the [[hippie]] subculture, while ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1993) holds cult status among American women born in the 1980s. Certain [[mainstream]] icons can become cult icons in a different context for certain people. ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1936) was originally intended to warn youth against the use of [[marijuana]], but because of its ridiculous plot, overwhelming amount of factual errors and cheap look, it is now often watched by audiences of [[cannabis smoking|marijuana-smokers]] and has gained a cult following.<ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book |last=Peary |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=Cult Movies |year=1981 |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-440-01626-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cultmoviesclassi0000pear/page/203 203\u2013205]|title-link=Cult Movies (book) }}</ref>\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s films borrow stylistically from classic cult films, but are appreciated by a large audience, and therefore lie somewhere between cult and mainstream.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Certain cult phenomena can grow to such proportions that they become [[mainstream]].\n\n===Television===\nMany cancelled television series (especially ones that had a short run life) see new life in a fan following. One example is ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', which was cancelled after three seasons and, because of the large fanbase, returned for a 15-episode season which was released on Netflix on May 26, 2013. ''[[Futurama]]'' is another series that was originally put on permanent hiatus after its initial 72-episode run. Strong DVD sales and consistent ratings on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] block led to four direct-to-DVD films that, in turn, led to the revival of the series in 2010 on [[Comedy Central]] following Adult Swim's expiration of the broadcast rights. ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' had a cult following throughout its eleven-season run on television, and helped pave the way for later shows of similar style, which also had cult followings, specifically ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' was cancelled after three seasons, but in [[broadcast syndication]] it gained a more substantial following, ultimately spawning a successful [[Star Trek|media franchise]].\n\nAnother cancelled series that has attained cult status is the NBC teen dramedy ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', which had an 18-episode run. Another series that was cancelled but gained a second life with cult status is the FOX teen medical dramedy ''[[Red Band Society]]'', which had a 13-episode run. Other examples include ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]'', ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', ''[[Gypsy (TV series)|Gypsy]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Pete & Pete]]'', which had short lives, yet achieved large fanbases.\n\nIn a [[BBC]] review of ''[[Farscape]]'' episode \"Throne for a Loss\", Richard Manning said \"''Farscape'' is now officially a cult series because it's being shown out of sequence\". The episode in question was actually shown as the second episode, after the premiere, despite originally being intended as the fifth episode to be shown.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/farscape/story/ep_2_review.shtml |publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |title=Throne to a loss |first=Richard |last=Manning |date=September 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeries often considered cult classics include the long-running BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963\u2013present),<ref name=\"DW\">{{cite news|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|title=Fantastic Voyage|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/04/fantastic-voyage|date=June 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> the ITC sci-fi thriller series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967\u20131968),<ref name=\"Prisoner\">{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|title=The Prisoner: Cult classic TV series to be revived for new audio drama|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a619443/the-prisoner-cult-classic-tv-series-to-be-revived-for-new-audio-drama/|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> and the Australian soap opera ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner: Cell Block H]]'' (1979\u20131986).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/425875/Wentworth-Prison-Prisoners-return-to-cell-block-H| title=Wentworth Prison: Prisoners return to cell block H| publisher=[[Daily Express]]| date=31 August 2013| accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{See also|List of cult video games}}\nSome video games, often those with unique concepts that fail to gain traction with the mainstream audience, attract cult followings and can influence the design of later video games.
