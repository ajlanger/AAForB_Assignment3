It may also be known as '''ship dismantling''', '''ship cracking''', or '''ship recycling'''. Modern ships have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years before [[corrosion]], [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] and a lack of parts render them uneconomical to operate.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Life Cycle of a Ship {{!}} shippipedia|url = http://www.shippipedia.com/life-cycle-of-a-ship/|website = www.shippipedia.com|accessdate = 2 August 2015}}</ref> Ship-breaking allows the materials from the ship, especially steel, to be [[recycling|recycled]] and made into new products. This lowers the demand for mined [[iron ore]] and reduces energy use in the [[steelmaking]] process. Fixtures and other equipment on board the vessels can also be reused. While ship-breaking is sustainable, there are concerns about the use by poorer countries without stringent environmental legislation. It is also labour-intensive, and considered one of the world's most dangerous industries.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ship breaking: Newfoundland\u2019s legacy with one of the most hazardous jobs|url = http://globalnews.ca/news/837009/ship-breaking-newfoundlands-legacy-with-one-of-the-most-hazardous-jobs/|accessdate = 4 August 2015|first = Ross|last = Lord|date = 12 September 2013|website = globalnews.ca|publisher = Shaw Media Inc.|last2 = Logan|first2 = Nick}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, roughly 1,250 ocean ships were broken down, and their average age was 26 years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = NGO Shipbreaking Platform \u00bb Problems and Solutions|url = http://www.shipbreakingplatform.org/problems-and-solutions/|website = www.shipbreakingplatform.org|accessdate = 2 August 2015|publisher = NGO Shipbreaking Platform}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|title = Technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of the full and partial dismantling of ships|url = http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/meetings/sbc/workdoc/techgships-e.pdf|journal = Basel Convention series/SBC.|issn = 1020-8364|access-date = 3 August 2015}}</ref> In 2013, the world total of demolished ships amounted to 29,052,000 tonnes, 92% of which were demolished in Asia.

Storage is a viable temporary option, whether on land or afloat, though all ships will be eventually scrapped, sunk, or preserved for museums.\n\n==History==\nWooden-hulled ships were simply set on fire or 'conveniently sunk'. In Tudor times, ships were also dismantled and the timber re-used. This procedure was no longer applicable with the advent of metal-hulled boats.<ref name=\"Bowen-1936\">{{Cite magazine |title = The Shipbreaking Industry |url = http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritish-Shipbreak.htm |magazine=Shipping Wonders of the World |publisher= www.naval-history.net|accessdate = 3 August 2015|first = Frank C|last = Bowen|date =10 November 1936}} [https://www.shippingwondersoftheworld.com/shipbreaking.html alternate URL]</ref>\n[[File:The Queen heeled over on the shore off the shipbreaker's yard.png|thumb|{{HMS|Queen|1839|6}} [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled over]] on the [[River Thames|Thames]] [[Intertidal zone|foreshore]] off [[Rotherhithe]].]]\n\nIn 1880, Denny Brothers of Dumbarton used forgings made from scrap maritime steel in their shipbuilding. Many other nations began to purchase British ships for scrap by the late 19th century, including [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the Netherlands and Japan. The Italian industry started in 1892, and the Japanese after an 1896 law had been passed to subsidise native shipbuilding.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n\nAfter being damaged or involved in a disaster, liner operators did not want the name of the broken ship to tarnish the brand of their passenger services. The final voyage of many Victorian ships was with the final letter of their name chipped off.<ref name=Bowen-1936/> \n\nIn the 1930s, it became cheaper to 'beach' a boat and run her ashore as opposed to using a dry dock. The ship would have to weigh as little as possible and run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a {{convert|10|ft}} rise of [[tide]] and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric [[Shear (sheet metal)|shears]], a [[wrecking ball]] and [[oxy-acetylene]] torches were used. The technique of the time is almost identical to that of developing countries today. Similarly, [[Thos W Ward]] Ltd., one of the largest breakers in the United Kingdom in the 1930s, would recondition and sell all furniture and machinery. Many historical artifacts were sold at public auctions: the Cunarder {{ship|RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, sold as scrap for {{GBP|78000}}, received high bids for her fittings worldwide. However, even with obsolete technology, any weapons and military information were carefully removed.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n[[File:Redoutable in Toulon-Agence Rol-1.jpeg|thumb|Dismantling of {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} in Toulon, 1912]]\n\n===Shifting to Asia===\nUntil the late 20th century, the majority of ship-breaking activity took place in the port cities of [[industrialized countries]] such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Those dismantlers that still remain in the United States work primarily on government surplus vessels.\n\nStarting in the mid-20th century, East Asian countries with lower labor costs began to dominate ship-breaking, moving as labor costs rose, initially from countries such as Japan and Hong Kong, to Korea and Taiwan and then to China. For example, the southern port city of [[Kaohsiung]] in Taiwan was the world's leading dismantling site in the late 1960s and 1970s, breaking up 220 ships totaling 1.6&nbsp;million tons in 1972 alone;<ref name=\"TR-1973\">{{cite news |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13609 |title=Shipbreaker to the world |date=March 1, 1973 |work=Taiwan Review |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> in 1977, Taiwan continued to dominate the industry with more than half the market share, followed by Spain and Pakistan.

It could not be re-floated and so remained there for several years. In 1965, the then in [[East Pakistan]], [[Chittagong]] Steel House bought the ship and had it scrapped. It took years to scrap the vessel, but the work gave birth to the industry in [[Bangladesh]].\nUntil 1980 the [[Gadani ship-breaking yard]] of [[Pakistan]] was the largest ship-breaking yard in the world.\n\nTightening environmental regulations resulted in increased costs of hazardous waste disposal in industrialised countries in the 1980s, causing ships to be exported to lower income nations, chiefly South Asia. This, in turn, created a far worse environmental problem, subsequently leading to the Basel Convention. In 2004 a Basel Convention decision officially classified old ships as \u201ctoxic waste\u201d, preventing them from leaving a country without the permission of the importing state.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.grida.no/files/publications/vital-waste2/VWG2_p3to46.pdf|title = Vital Waste Graphics 2|date = November 2006|accessdate = 1 August 2015|website = www.grida.no|publisher = The Basel Convention Secretariat|last = Heberlein|first = Claudia|page = 31}}</ref> This has led to a resurgence of recycling in environmentally-compliant locations in developed countries, especially in former ship building yards.<ref>{{Cite web|title = AMERICAN SHIP BREAKING IT ALL COMES APART AT THE BOTTOM OF AMERICA|url = http://www.clui.org/newsletter/spring-2010/american-ship-breaking|website = www.clui.org|accessdate = 3 August 2015|date = Spring 2010|publisher = The Center for Land Use Interpretation}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 December 2005, the French Navy's {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Clemenceau|R98|2}} left [[Toulon]] to be dismantled in [[Alang]], [[India]] despite protests over improper disposal capabilities and facilities for the toxic wastes.

Any re-usable items\u2014wiring, furniture and machinery\u2014are sent to local markets or the trade. Unwanted materials become inputs to their relevant waste streams. Often, in less-developed nations, these industries are no better than ship-breaking.

[[Crane (machine)|Cranes]] are not typically used on the ship, because of costs.  Pieces of the hull simply fall off and are dragged up on the beach, possibly aided with a winch or bulldozer.<ref name=\":12\" /> These are then cut into smaller pieces away from the coast.<ref name=\":11\" /> 90% of the steel is re-rollable scrap: higher quality steel plates that are heated and reused as [[Rebar|reinforcement bar]] for construction.<ref name=\":7\" /> The remainder is transported to [[electric arc furnace]]s to be melted down into ingots for re-rolling mills. In the re-rolling mills, the heating of painted steel plates (in particular, those painted with chlorinated rubber paints) generates dioxins.<ref name=\":5\" /> Substances which are costly to dispose of, such as hazardous waste, are left on the beach or set on fire, even old batteries and half-empty cans of paint.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stockpiled in Bangladesh, for example, are 79,000 tonnes of [[asbestos]], 240,000 tonnes of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and 210,000 tonnes of [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting substances]] (mainly chlorinated [[polyurethane]] foam).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Developed countries ===\nIn developed countries the dismantling process should mirror the technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of the full and partial dismantling of ships, published by the Basel Convention in 2003.<ref name=\":4\" /> Recycling rates of 98% can be achieved in these facilities.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|title = Able UK's TERRC yard on Teesside|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tees/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8147000/8147873.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 23 November 2010|access-date = 3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nPrior to dismantling, an inventory of dangerous substances should be compiled.

The Basel Convention demands that all yards separate hazardous and non-hazardous waste and have appropriate storage units, and this must be done before the hull is cut up. [[Asbestos]], found in the engine room, is isolated and stored in custom-made plastic wrapping prior to being placed in secure steel containers, which are then landfilled.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nMany hazardous wastes can be recycled into new products. Examples include lead-acid batteries or electronic circuit boards. Another commonly used treatment is [[cement]]-based [[solidification and stabilization]]. [[Cement kiln]]s are used because they can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. A hazardous waste may also be \"destroyed\" by [[incinerating]] it at a high temperature; flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using [[pyrolysis]] in a high temperature electrical arc, in inert conditions to avoid combustion. This treatment method may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants. Dangerous chemicals can also be permanently stored in landfills as long as leaching is prevented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcenter.gov/assistance/facilitytour/landfills/hazwaste/|title=FedCenter \u2013 Hazardous Waste Landfills|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/td/ldu/index.htm Land Disposal Units]</ref>\n\nValuable metals, such as copper in electric cable, that are mixed with other materials may be recovered by the use of shredders and separators in the same fashion as [[Computer recycling|e-waste recycling.]] The shredders cut the electronics into metallic and non-metallic pieces. Metals are extracted using magnetic separators, air flotation separator columns, shaker tables or [[eddy current]]s.

A typical 5,000-ton ship could be broken up in 25 to 30 days.<ref name=TR-1973/>\n\nThe process began with \"cleaning\", a process in which subcontractors would come on board the ship to strip it of loose and flammable items, which were often resold in second-hand shops. After that, the cutting crews would start to dismantle the hull, stern-first; large sections were cut off the ship and moved via cranes and rigging taken from previously-scrapped ships.

Burns from explosions and fire, suffocation, mutilation from falling metal, cancer, and disease from toxins are regular occurrences in the industry. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas are commonplace.<ref name=\"amrc\">[http://www.amrc.org.hk/alu_article/occupational_safety_and_health_in_asia/asbestos_in_the_ship_breaking_industry_of_banglad AMRC: Asbestos in the Ship-breaking industry of Bangladesh: Action for Ban]</ref>\n\nRemoving the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the value of the scrap metal itself. In the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of [[Personal injury|personal injury lawsuits]] or [[Workers' compensation|workers' health claims]], meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. The sandy beaches cannot sufficiently support the heavy equipment, which is thus prone to collapse. Many are injured from explosions when flammable gas is not removed from fuel tanks. In Bangladesh, a local watchdog group claims that one worker dies a week and one is injured per a day on average.<ref>Vidal, John (5 May 2012).

The ship would have to weigh as little as possible and run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a {{convert|10|ft}} rise of [[tide]] and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric [[Shear (sheet metal)|shears]], a [[wrecking ball]] and [[oxy-acetylene]] torches were used. The technique of the time is almost identical to that of developing countries today. Similarly, [[Thos W Ward]] Ltd., one of the largest breakers in the United Kingdom in the 1930s, would recondition and sell all furniture and machinery. Many historical artifacts were sold at public auctions: the Cunarder {{ship|RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, sold as scrap for {{GBP|78000}}, received high bids for her fittings worldwide. However, even with obsolete technology, any weapons and military information were carefully removed.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n[[File:Redoutable in Toulon-Agence Rol-1.jpeg|thumb|Dismantling of {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} in Toulon, 1912]]\n\n===Shifting to Asia===\nUntil the late 20th century, the majority of ship-breaking activity took place in the port cities of [[industrialized countries]] such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].

For example, the southern port city of [[Kaohsiung]] in Taiwan was the world's leading dismantling site in the late 1960s and 1970s, breaking up 220 ships totaling 1.6&nbsp;million tons in 1972 alone;<ref name=\"TR-1973\">{{cite news |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13609 |title=Shipbreaker to the world |date=March 1, 1973 |work=Taiwan Review |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> in 1977, Taiwan continued to dominate the industry with more than half the market share, followed by Spain and Pakistan.

It took years to scrap the vessel, but the work gave birth to the industry in [[Bangladesh]].\nUntil 1980 the [[Gadani ship-breaking yard]] of [[Pakistan]] was the largest ship-breaking yard in the world.\n\nTightening environmental regulations resulted in increased costs of hazardous waste disposal in industrialised countries in the 1980s, causing ships to be exported to lower income nations, chiefly South Asia.

Examples include lead-acid batteries or electronic circuit boards. Another commonly used treatment is [[cement]]-based [[solidification and stabilization]]. [[Cement kiln]]s are used because they can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. A hazardous waste may also be \"destroyed\" by [[incinerating]] it at a high temperature; flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using [[pyrolysis]] in a high temperature electrical arc, in inert conditions to avoid combustion. This treatment method may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants. Dangerous chemicals can also be permanently stored in landfills as long as leaching is prevented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcenter.gov/assistance/facilitytour/landfills/hazwaste/|title=FedCenter \u2013 Hazardous Waste Landfills|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/td/ldu/index.htm Land Disposal Units]</ref>\n\nValuable metals, such as copper in electric cable, that are mixed with other materials may be recovered by the use of shredders and separators in the same fashion as [[Computer recycling|e-waste recycling.]] The shredders cut the electronics into metallic and non-metallic pieces.

A typical 5,000-ton ship could be broken up in 25 to 30 days.<ref name=TR-1973/>\n\nThe process began with \"cleaning\", a process in which subcontractors would come on board the ship to strip it of loose and flammable items, which were often resold in second-hand shops. After that, the cutting crews would start to dismantle the hull, stern-first; large sections were cut off the ship and moved via cranes and rigging taken from previously-scrapped ships.

Burns from explosions and fire, suffocation, mutilation from falling metal, cancer, and disease from toxins are regular occurrences in the industry. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas are commonplace.<ref name=\"amrc\">[http://www.amrc.org.hk/alu_article/occupational_safety_and_health_in_asia/asbestos_in_the_ship_breaking_industry_of_banglad AMRC: Asbestos in the Ship-breaking industry of Bangladesh: Action for Ban]</ref>\n\nRemoving the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the value of the scrap metal itself. In the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of [[Personal injury|personal injury lawsuits]] or [[Workers' compensation|workers' health claims]], meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. The sandy beaches cannot sufficiently support the heavy equipment, which is thus prone to collapse. Many are injured from explosions when flammable gas is not removed from fuel tanks. In Bangladesh, a local watchdog group claims that one worker dies a week and one is injured per a day on average.<ref>Vidal, John (5 May 2012).
