He was a member of the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nRudolf's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways:<ref name=hotson>Hotson, 1999.</ref> an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the [[Thirty Years' War]]; a great and influential patron of [[Northern Mannerist]] art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Archdukerudolf.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Archduke Rudolf, aged 15, painted by [[Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello]].]]\n\nRudolf was born in [[Vienna]] on 18 July 1552. He was the eldest son and successor of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], Holy Roman Emperor, King of [[Bohemia]], and King of Hungary and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]; his mother was [[Maria of Spain]], a daughter of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Isabella of Portugal]]. He was the elder brother of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] who was to succeed him as king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nRudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563\u20131571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], together with his younger brother [[Archduke_Ernest_of_Austria|Ernest]], future governor of the [[Low Countries]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edgarda|last1=Ferri|title=Rodolfo II. Un imperatore nella Praga dell'arte, della scienza e dell'alchimia|year=2007|publisher=Arnoldo Mondadori Editore}}</ref> After his return to Vienna, his father was concerned about Rudolf's aloof and stiff manner, typical of the more conservative Spanish court, rather than the more relaxed and open Austrian court; but his Spanish mother saw in him courtliness and refinement.<ref name=marshall>Marshall, 2006.</ref> In the years following his return to Vienna, Rudolf was created [[King of Hungary]] (1572), [[King of Bohemia]] and [[King of the Romans]] (1575)<ref name=\"Treccani\">[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/rodolfo-ii-imperatore/ \"Rod\u00f2lfo II Imperatore\" at ''Enciclopedia Treccani'']</ref> when his father was still alive. \n\nRudolf would remain for the rest of his life reserved, secretive, and largely a recluse who did not like to travel or even partake in the daily affairs of state.<ref name=marshall/> He was more intrigued by occult learning such as astrology and alchemy, which was mainstream in the [[Renaissance]] period, and had a wide variety of personal hobbies such as horses, clocks, collecting rarities, and being a patron of the arts. He suffered from periodic bouts of \"[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]\" (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age, and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Portrait bust of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Antwerp City Hall, Belgium - 20150629-03.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait bust of Rudolf II in the collection of the [[Antwerp City Hall]], Belgium]]\n[[File:Rudolf II, Martino Rota.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by Martino Rota.]]\n\nLike his near-contemporary, [[Elizabeth I of England]] (who was born 19 years before he was), Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets. One of these, Philip Lang, ruled him for years and was hated by those seeking favour with the emperor.<ref name=rowse>Rowse, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn addition, Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him.<ref name=marshall/> He had several illegitimate children with his mistress [[Catherina Strada]]. Their eldest son, [[Don Julius Caesar d'Austria]], was likely born between 1584 and 1586 and received an education and opportunities for political and social prominence from his father.<ref name=\"Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate\">{{cite web|title=Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate|url=http://www.castle.ckrumlov.cz/docs/en/zamek_oinf_dojuda.xml|publisher=State Castle and Chateau \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>  In 1607, Rudolf sent Julius to live at [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]] in Bohemia (in what is now the [[Czech Republic]]), a castle which Rudolf purchased from [[Peter Vok of Rosenberg|Peter Vok/Wok von Rosenberg]], the last of the [[House of Rosenberg]], after he fell into financial ruin.  Julius lived at \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov when in 1608 he reportedly abused and murdered the daughter of a local barber, who had been living in the castle, and then disfigured her body. Rudolf condemned his son's act and suggested that he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life.  However, Julius died in 1609 after showing signs of [[schizophrenia]], refusing to bathe, and living in squalor; his death was apparently caused by an ulcer that ruptured.<ref name=\"Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate\"/>\n\nMany artworks commissioned by Rudolf are unusually erotic.<ref>Trevor-Roper, 116-120</ref> The emperor was the subject of a whispering campaign by his enemies in his family and the [[Catholic Church]] in the years before he was deposed. Sexual allegations may well have formed a part of the campaign against him.<ref>Trevor-Roper, 121-123. Trevor-Roper mentions many stories and rumours, but not those of Rudolf's homosexuality</ref>\n\n==Reign==\nRudolf succeeded his father Maximiliam II on 12 October 1576.<ref name=\"Treccani\"/> In 1583 he moved the court to Prague.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Frucht|editor-first=Richard C.|title=Eastern Europe|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-800-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252 252]|url=https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have traditionally blamed Rudolf's preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests as the reason for the political disasters of his reign.<ref name=hotson/> More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.<ref name=hotson/>\n\n[[Image:Rudolf2c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] by [[Aegidius Sadeler]] (1603).]]\n[[File:Martino Rota - Emperor Rudolf II in Armour - WGA20140.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Rudolf II as a young man by [[Martino Rota]].]]\n\nAlthough raised in his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of [[Protestantism]] and other religions including [[Judaism]].<ref name=marshall/> He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind [[conciliarist]]s, [[irenicist]]s and [[humanists]]. When the papacy instigated the [[Counter-Reformation]], using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.<ref name=hotson/>\n\nHis conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Turks, and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new [[Crusade]], he started a long and indecisive war with the Turks in 1593.<ref>Craft, Kimberly L. (2011) ''The Private Letters of Countess Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory'', pp. 73-74.</ref> This war lasted till 1606, and was known as \"[[Long War (Ottoman wars)|The Long War]]\".<ref name=hotson/> By 1604 his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by [[Stephen Bocskay]] ([[Bocskai Uprising]]). In 1605 Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]]. Matthias by 1606 forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels ([[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]]) and the Turks ([[Peace of Zsitvatorok]]). Rudolf was angry with his brother's concessions, which he saw as giving away too much in order to further Matthias' hold on power. So Rudolf prepared to start a new war with the Turks. But Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia to him. At the same time, seeing a moment of royal weakness, Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the ''[[Letter of Majesty]]'' in 1609. The Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them. The Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help; Matthias' army then held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague, until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia to his brother.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Krone Kaiser Rudolf II Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Crown of Rudolf II]] later became the imperial crown of the [[Austrian Empire]].]]\n\n[[Image:Imperial Crown of Austria Globus cruciger Sceptre.jpg|right|thumb|Crown, scepter and globus cruciger of Rudolf II.]]\n\nRudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the [[Defenestration of Prague]], the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the ''Letter of Majesty'', threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) started.\n\n==Patronage of arts and collectionism==\nRudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings, and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end.<ref name=marshall/> He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Brueghel]]. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the [[Northern Mannerist]] style, such as [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], [[Hans von Aachen]], [[Giambologna]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Aegidius Sadeler]], [[Roelant Savery]], and [[Adrian de Vries]], as well as commissioning works from Italians like [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. Rudolf's collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day, and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever assembled.<ref name=hotson/> The adjective '''Rudolfine''', as in \"Rudolfine Mannerism\" is often used in art history to describe the style of the art he patronized.\n\nRudolf's love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, water works, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments, were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.\n\nHe patronized [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as the botanist [[Charles de l'Ecluse]], and the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the [[Rudolphine Tables]] (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of the movements of the planets. As mentioned before, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[Erasmus Habermel]] and [[Hans Christoph Schissler]]. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last= Kern|title= Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Volume 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck|location= Cologne|year= 2010|pages=366 and 370}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vertumnus \u00e5rstidernas gud m\u00e5lad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiff|thumb|200px|right|Rudolf painted as [[Vertumnus]], Roman God of the seasons, by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (1590\u20131). Rudolf greatly appreciated the work.]]\nThe poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], a writer of [[Renaissance Latin]] poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.\n\nRudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe's most extensive \"[[cabinet of curiosities]]\"<ref name=marshall/> (''Kunstkammer'') incorporating \"the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man\". It was housed at [[Prague Castle]], where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections.<ref>Wendell E. Wilson, Joel A.

According to hearsay passed on in a letter written by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in 1665, Rudolf was said to have acquired the manuscript at some unspecified time for 600 gold [[ducat]]s. No evidence in support of this single piece of hearsay has ever been discovered. The [[Codex Gigas]] was also in his possessions. \n\nAs was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello. Completed in 1567 by Alonso Sanchez Coello, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in the Rozmberk room.\n[[File:Celestial globe with clockwork MET DP237684.jpg|thumb|left|Richly ornamented [[celestial globe]] with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, 1579]]\nBy 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated ''Kunstkammer''. ''Naturalia'' ([[mineral]]s and [[gemstone]]s) were arranged in a 37 cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 metres wide by 3 metres high and 60 metres long, connected to a main chamber 33 metres long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.<ref name=minhistory>{{cite book |title=The History of Mineral Collecting, 1530\u20131799 |last=Wilson |first=Wendell |editor=Wilson, Wendell |year=1994 |publisher=Mineralogical Record |url=http://www.minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |access-date=2012-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326044645/http://minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |archive-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRudolf's ''Kunstkammer'' was not a typical \"cabinet of curiosities\" \u2013 a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine ''Kunstkammer'' was systematically arranged in an [[encyclopaedic]] fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt|Anselmus Boetius de Boodt]], to [[curator|curate]] the collection. [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the [[mining]] regions of Germany, [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], often accompanied by his Bohemian [[naturalist]] friend, [[Thaddaeus Hagecius]]. Between 1607 and 1611, [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] catalogued the ''Kunstkammer'', and in 1609 he published ''Gemmarum et Lapidum'', one of the finest mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.<ref name =minhistory/>\n[[File:Praha Hoefnagel 1595 DSCN0730.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Prague Castle]] in 1595 by [[Joris Hoefnagel]].]]\n\nAs was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the Emperor, artists, and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European [[philosophy]], the \"[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]\".\n\nRudolf's successors did not appreciate the collection and the ''Kunstkammer'' gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to [[Vienna]]. The collection remaining at [[Prague]] was looted during the last year of the [[Thirty Years War]], by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648, also taking the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the [[Orl\u00e9ans Collection]] after the death of [[Christina of Sweden]]. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. One of the surviving items from the ''Kunstkammer''  is a \"fine chair\" looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]] in England;<ref>Hayward, J.

His lifelong quest was to find the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe's best alchemists to court, such as [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory.<ref name=marshall/> When Rudolf was a prince, [[Nostradamus]] prepared a horoscope which was dedicated to him as 'Prince and King'. In the 1590s [[Sendivogius]] was active at Rudolph's court.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.udu.cas.cz/en/archive/alchemy-and-rudolf-ii-searching-for-the-secrets-of-nature-in-central-europe-in-the-16th-and-17th-centuries|title=Alchemy and Rudolf II.

He was a member of the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nRudolf's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways:<ref name=hotson>Hotson, 1999.</ref> an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the [[Thirty Years' War]]; a great and influential patron of [[Northern Mannerist]] art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Archdukerudolf.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Archduke Rudolf, aged 15, painted by [[Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello]].]]\n\nRudolf was born in [[Vienna]] on 18 July 1552. He was the eldest son and successor of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], Holy Roman Emperor, King of [[Bohemia]], and King of Hungary and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]; his mother was [[Maria of Spain]], a daughter of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Isabella of Portugal]]. He was the elder brother of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] who was to succeed him as king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nRudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563\u20131571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], together with his younger brother [[Archduke_Ernest_of_Austria|Ernest]], future governor of the [[Low Countries]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edgarda|last1=Ferri|title=Rodolfo II. Un imperatore nella Praga dell'arte, della scienza e dell'alchimia|year=2007|publisher=Arnoldo Mondadori Editore}}</ref> After his return to Vienna, his father was concerned about Rudolf's aloof and stiff manner, typical of the more conservative Spanish court, rather than the more relaxed and open Austrian court; but his Spanish mother saw in him courtliness and refinement.<ref name=marshall>Marshall, 2006.</ref> In the years following his return to Vienna, Rudolf was created [[King of Hungary]] (1572), [[King of Bohemia]] and [[King of the Romans]] (1575)<ref name=\"Treccani\">[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/rodolfo-ii-imperatore/ \"Rod\u00f2lfo II Imperatore\" at ''Enciclopedia Treccani'']</ref> when his father was still alive. \n\nRudolf would remain for the rest of his life reserved, secretive, and largely a recluse who did not like to travel or even partake in the daily affairs of state.<ref name=marshall/> He was more intrigued by occult learning such as astrology and alchemy, which was mainstream in the [[Renaissance]] period, and had a wide variety of personal hobbies such as horses, clocks, collecting rarities, and being a patron of the arts. He suffered from periodic bouts of \"[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]\" (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age, and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Portrait bust of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Antwerp City Hall, Belgium - 20150629-03.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait bust of Rudolf II in the collection of the [[Antwerp City Hall]], Belgium]]\n[[File:Rudolf II, Martino Rota.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by Martino Rota.]]\n\nLike his near-contemporary, [[Elizabeth I of England]] (who was born 19 years before he was), Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets. One of these, Philip Lang, ruled him for years and was hated by those seeking favour with the emperor.<ref name=rowse>Rowse, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn addition, Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him.<ref name=marshall/> He had several illegitimate children with his mistress [[Catherina Strada]]. Their eldest son, [[Don Julius Caesar d'Austria]], was likely born between 1584 and 1586 and received an education and opportunities for political and social prominence from his father.<ref name=\"Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate\">{{cite web|title=Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate|url=http://www.castle.ckrumlov.cz/docs/en/zamek_oinf_dojuda.xml|publisher=State Castle and Chateau \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>  In 1607, Rudolf sent Julius to live at [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]] in Bohemia (in what is now the [[Czech Republic]]), a castle which Rudolf purchased from [[Peter Vok of Rosenberg|Peter Vok/Wok von Rosenberg]], the last of the [[House of Rosenberg]], after he fell into financial ruin.  Julius lived at \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov when in 1608 he reportedly abused and murdered the daughter of a local barber, who had been living in the castle, and then disfigured her body. Rudolf condemned his son's act and suggested that he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life.  However, Julius died in 1609 after showing signs of [[schizophrenia]], refusing to bathe, and living in squalor; his death was apparently caused by an ulcer that ruptured.<ref name=\"Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate\"/>\n\nMany artworks commissioned by Rudolf are unusually erotic.<ref>Trevor-Roper, 116-120</ref> The emperor was the subject of a whispering campaign by his enemies in his family and the [[Catholic Church]] in the years before he was deposed. Sexual allegations may well have formed a part of the campaign against him.<ref>Trevor-Roper, 121-123. Trevor-Roper mentions many stories and rumours, but not those of Rudolf's homosexuality</ref>\n\n==Reign==\nRudolf succeeded his father Maximiliam II on 12 October 1576.<ref name=\"Treccani\"/> In 1583 he moved the court to Prague.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Frucht|editor-first=Richard C.|title=Eastern Europe|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-800-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252 252]|url=https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have traditionally blamed Rudolf's preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests as the reason for the political disasters of his reign.<ref name=hotson/> More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.<ref name=hotson/>\n\n[[Image:Rudolf2c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] by [[Aegidius Sadeler]] (1603).]]\n[[File:Martino Rota - Emperor Rudolf II in Armour - WGA20140.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Rudolf II as a young man by [[Martino Rota]].]]\n\nAlthough raised in his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of [[Protestantism]] and other religions including [[Judaism]].<ref name=marshall/> He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind [[conciliarist]]s, [[irenicist]]s and [[humanists]]. When the papacy instigated the [[Counter-Reformation]], using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.<ref name=hotson/>\n\nHis conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Turks, and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new [[Crusade]], he started a long and indecisive war with the Turks in 1593.<ref>Craft, Kimberly L. (2011) ''The Private Letters of Countess Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory'', pp. 73-74.</ref> This war lasted till 1606, and was known as \"[[Long War (Ottoman wars)|The Long War]]\".<ref name=hotson/> By 1604 his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by [[Stephen Bocskay]] ([[Bocskai Uprising]]). In 1605 Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]]. Matthias by 1606 forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels ([[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]]) and the Turks ([[Peace of Zsitvatorok]]). Rudolf was angry with his brother's concessions, which he saw as giving away too much in order to further Matthias' hold on power. So Rudolf prepared to start a new war with the Turks. But Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia to him. At the same time, seeing a moment of royal weakness, Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the ''[[Letter of Majesty]]'' in 1609. The Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them. The Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help; Matthias' army then held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague, until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia to his brother.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Krone Kaiser Rudolf II Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Crown of Rudolf II]] later became the imperial crown of the [[Austrian Empire]].]]\n\n[[Image:Imperial Crown of Austria Globus cruciger Sceptre.jpg|right|thumb|Crown, scepter and globus cruciger of Rudolf II.]]\n\nRudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the [[Defenestration of Prague]], the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the ''Letter of Majesty'', threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) started.\n\n==Patronage of arts and collectionism==\nRudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings, and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end.<ref name=marshall/> He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Brueghel]]. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the [[Northern Mannerist]] style, such as [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], [[Hans von Aachen]], [[Giambologna]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Aegidius Sadeler]], [[Roelant Savery]], and [[Adrian de Vries]], as well as commissioning works from Italians like [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. Rudolf's collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day, and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever assembled.<ref name=hotson/> The adjective '''Rudolfine''', as in \"Rudolfine Mannerism\" is often used in art history to describe the style of the art he patronized.\n\nRudolf's love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, water works, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments, were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.\n\nHe patronized [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as the botanist [[Charles de l'Ecluse]], and the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the [[Rudolphine Tables]] (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of the movements of the planets. As mentioned before, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[Erasmus Habermel]] and [[Hans Christoph Schissler]]. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last= Kern|title= Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Volume 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck|location= Cologne|year= 2010|pages=366 and 370}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vertumnus \u00e5rstidernas gud m\u00e5lad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiff|thumb|200px|right|Rudolf painted as [[Vertumnus]], Roman God of the seasons, by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (1590\u20131). Rudolf greatly appreciated the work.]]\nThe poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], a writer of [[Renaissance Latin]] poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.\n\nRudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe's most extensive \"[[cabinet of curiosities]]\"<ref name=marshall/> (''Kunstkammer'') incorporating \"the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man\". It was housed at [[Prague Castle]], where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections.<ref>Wendell E. Wilson, Joel A.

According to hearsay passed on in a letter written by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in 1665, Rudolf was said to have acquired the manuscript at some unspecified time for 600 gold [[ducat]]s. No evidence in support of this single piece of hearsay has ever been discovered. The [[Codex Gigas]] was also in his possessions. \n\nAs was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello. Completed in 1567 by Alonso Sanchez Coello, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in the Rozmberk room.\n[[File:Celestial globe with clockwork MET DP237684.jpg|thumb|left|Richly ornamented [[celestial globe]] with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, 1579]]\nBy 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated ''Kunstkammer''. ''Naturalia'' ([[mineral]]s and [[gemstone]]s) were arranged in a 37 cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 metres wide by 3 metres high and 60 metres long, connected to a main chamber 33 metres long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.<ref name=minhistory>{{cite book |title=The History of Mineral Collecting, 1530\u20131799 |last=Wilson |first=Wendell |editor=Wilson, Wendell |year=1994 |publisher=Mineralogical Record |url=http://www.minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |access-date=2012-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326044645/http://minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |archive-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRudolf's ''Kunstkammer'' was not a typical \"cabinet of curiosities\" \u2013 a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine ''Kunstkammer'' was systematically arranged in an [[encyclopaedic]] fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt|Anselmus Boetius de Boodt]], to [[curator|curate]] the collection. [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the [[mining]] regions of Germany, [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], often accompanied by his Bohemian [[naturalist]] friend, [[Thaddaeus Hagecius]]. Between 1607 and 1611, [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] catalogued the ''Kunstkammer'', and in 1609 he published ''Gemmarum et Lapidum'', one of the finest mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.<ref name =minhistory/>\n[[File:Praha Hoefnagel 1595 DSCN0730.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Prague Castle]] in 1595 by [[Joris Hoefnagel]].]]\n\nAs was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the Emperor, artists, and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European [[philosophy]], the \"[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]\".\n\nRudolf's successors did not appreciate the collection and the ''Kunstkammer'' gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to [[Vienna]]. The collection remaining at [[Prague]] was looted during the last year of the [[Thirty Years War]], by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648, also taking the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the [[Orl\u00e9ans Collection]] after the death of [[Christina of Sweden]]. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. One of the surviving items from the ''Kunstkammer''  is a \"fine chair\" looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]] in England;<ref>Hayward, J.

His lifelong quest was to find the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe's best alchemists to court, such as [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory.<ref name=marshall/> When Rudolf was a prince, [[Nostradamus]] prepared a horoscope which was dedicated to him as 'Prince and King'.
