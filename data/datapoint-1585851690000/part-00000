{"title_page": "Alternatives to general relativity", "text_new": "{{Short description|Proposed theories of gravity}}\n\n{{disputed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Alternatives to general relativity''' are [[Physical theory|physical theories]] that attempt to describe the phenomenon of [[gravitation]] in competition to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]]. He assumed, like [[Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner]], that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lorentz, H.A. | authorlink = Hendrik Lorentz | title=Considerations on Gravitation | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) | date=1900 | volume=2 | pages=559\u2013574 | url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00014433.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Lorentz-invariant models (1905\u20131910)===\nBased on the [[principle of relativity]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905, 1906), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1908), and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910) tried to modify Newton's theory and to establish a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] gravitational law, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them. The theory states that the speed of light is constant in free space but varies in the presence of matter. The theory was only expected to hold when the source of the gravitational field is stationary.

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3.

[[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]].

How to add a [[#Cosmological constant and quintessence|cosmological constant or quintessence]] to a theory is discussed under Modern Theories (see also [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]]).\n\n=== Scalar field theories ===\n{{See also|Scalar theories of gravitation}}\n\nThe scalar field theories of Nordstr\u00f6m<ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1912 /><ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1913 /> have already been discussed.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more. In the first, a pre-existing special relativity space-time and universal time coordinate acts with matter and non-gravitational fields to generate a scalar field.  This scalar field acts together with all the rest to generate the metric.\n\nThe action is:\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-g}L_\\varphi+S_m</math>\n\n: <math>L_\\varphi=\\varphi R-2g^{\\mu\\nu} \\, \\partial_\\mu\\varphi \\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi</math>\n\nMisner et al.<ref name=Misner1973>Misner, C.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

The skew field coupling is a Pauli coupling and is gauge invariant for any source current. The source current looks like a matter fermion field associated with baryon and lepton number.\n\n====Scalar-tensor-vector gravity====\n{{main|Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity}}\n\nMoffat's [[Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]]<ref name=Moffat2006 /> contains a tensor, vector and three scalar fields.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G.

This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C.

Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories.

A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G.

In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

(1917) \u00dcber die Spezielle und die Allgemeinen Relativat\u00e4tstheorie, Gemeinverst\u00e4ndlich, Vieweg, Braunschweig</ref> is what we now call \"general relativity\" (included here for comparison).

See [[relativity priority dispute]]. Hilbert was the first to correctly state the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] for general relativity, which is:\n\n:<math>S = {c^4 \\over 16 \\pi G} \\int R \\sqrt{-g} \\ d^4 x + S_m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>G \\,</math> is Newton's gravitational constant, <math>R = R_{\\mu}^{~\\mu} \\,</math> is the [[Ricci curvature]] of space, <math>g = \\det ( g_{\\mu \\nu} ) \\,</math> and <math>S_m \\,</math> is the [[action (physics)|action]] due to mass.\n\nGeneral relativity is a tensor theory, the equations all contain tensors. Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

Their constraint is eight orders of magnitude sharper than previous estimates.\n\nMoffat's<ref name=Moffat2005 /> metric-skew-tensor-gravity (MSTG) theory is able to predict rotation curves for galaxies without either dark matter or MOND, and claims that it can also explain gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters without dark matter. It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

The skew field coupling is a Pauli coupling and is gauge invariant for any source current. The source current looks like a matter fermion field associated with baryon and lepton number.\n\n====Scalar-tensor-vector gravity====\n{{main|Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity}}\n\nMoffat's [[Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]]<ref name=Moffat2006 /> contains a tensor, vector and three scalar fields. But the equations are quite straightforward. The action is split into: <math> S=S_G+S_K+S_S+S_M</math> with terms for gravity, vector field <math>K_\\mu,</math> scalar fields <math>G, \\omega, \\mu</math> and mass. <math>S_G</math> is the standard gravity term with the exception that <math>G</math> is moved inside the integral.\n\n: <math>S_K=-\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\omega \\left( \\frac14 B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} + V(K) \\right), \\qquad \\text{where } \\quad B_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_\\mu K_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu K_\\mu.</math>\n\n: <math>S_S = -\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{G^3} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu G\\,\\nabla_\\nu G -V(G) \\right) + \\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\omega\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\omega -V(\\omega) \\right) +{1\\over\\mu^2G} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\mu\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\mu - V(\\mu) \\right).</math>\n\nThe potential function for the vector field is chosen to be:\n\n: <math>V(K) = -\\frac12\\mu^2\\varphi^\\mu\\varphi_\\mu - \\frac14g \\left (\\varphi^\\mu \\varphi_\\mu \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is a coupling constant. The functions assumed for the scalar potentials are not stated.\n\n=== Infinite derivative gravity ===\n{{main|Infinite derivative gravity}}\nIn order to remove ghosts in the modified propagator, as well as to obtain asymptotic freedom, Biswas, [[Anupam Mazumdar|Mazumdar]] and [[Warren Siegel|Siegel]] (2005) considered a string-inspired infinite set of higher derivative terms\n:<math>S = \\int \\mathrm{d}^4x  \\sqrt{-g} \\left(\\frac{R}{2} + R F (\\Box) R \\right)</math>\nwhere <math> F (\\Box)</math> is the exponential of an entire function of the [[d'Alembert operator|D'Alembertian operator]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bouncing Universes in String-inspired Gravity|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume=2006|issue=3|pages=009|arxiv=hep-th/0508194|bibcode = 2006JCAP...03..009B |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2006/03/009 |year=2006|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Anupam|last3=Siegel|first3=Warren}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1308.2319 |title=Generalized ghost-free quadratic curvature gravity|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume=31|issue=1|pages=015022|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Conroy|first2=Aindri\u00fa|last3= Koshelev|first3=Alexey S.|last4=Mazumdar|first4=Anupam|year=2013|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/31/1/015022|bibcode = 2014CQGra..31a5022B }}</ref> This avoids a black hole singularity near the origin, while recovering the 1/r fall of the general relativity potential at large distances.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1110.5249|title=Towards singularity and ghost free theories of gravity|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=108|issue=3|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Gerwick|first2=Erik|last3=Koivisto|first3=Tomi|last4=Mazumdar|first4=Anupam|year=2011|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.031101|bibcode=2012PhRvL.108c1101B|pmid=22400725|page=031101}}</ref> [[Carlos Lousto|Lousto]] and Mazzitelli (1997) found an exact solution to this theories representing a gravitational shock-wave.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.56.3471|title=Exact self-consistent gravitational shock wave in semiclassical gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=56|issue=6|pages=3471\u20133477|year=1997|last1=Lousto|first1=Carlos O|last2=Mazzitelli|first2=Francisco D|bibcode=1997PhRvD..56.3471L|arxiv=gr-qc/9611009}}</ref>\n\n== Testing of alternatives to general relativity ==\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nAny putative alternative to general relativity would need to meet a variety of tests for it to become accepted.  For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.
