It was released on 29 May 1995 by [[EMI Records|EMI]] in the United Kingdom and on 6 June 1995 by [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in the United States.<ref name=\"emi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esounds.com/esounds/EN/Details.aspx?ProductID=M0724383270019&VariantID=0724383270026 |title=esounds |accessdate=8 July 2007 |publisher=EMI }}</ref> The album was recorded during the European leg of Pink Floyd's [[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell Tour]] in 1994.\n\n==Content and recording==\nThe album is notable for including a complete live version of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. It also features \"[[Astronomy Domine]]\", a [[Syd Barrett]] song not performed since the early 1970s. The track \"[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall, Part II]]\" features small portions of the songs \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part I\", \"[[The Happiest Days of Our Lives]]\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part III\". \"[[Take It Back]]\" was originally going to be on the album with the recording from 25 September 1994, [[Stade Olympique de la Pontaise]], [[Lausanne]] but was cut due to length.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nUnlike the previous live album ''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder]]'', no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio.<ref>James Guthrie confirmed this in an interview with Pink Floyd fanzine ''Brain Damage''.</ref> However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The album was mixed in [[QSound]], which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.\n\n==Release history==\nIn the United States, despite a price of $34.99 (which included flashing spine light and two AA batteries) ''Pulse'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] during the week of 24 June 1995 with 198,000 copies sold, it became the first multidisk album to top the ''Billboard'' 200 since the chart started using [[SoundScan]] data in May 1991.<ref name=\"BBdebut\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com.bo/books?id=zwsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92|title=Between The Bullets|last=Mayfield|first=Geoff|date=June 24, 1995|page=92|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|issn=0006-2510|volume=107|number=25}}</ref> The next week it fell off to number three on the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1995-07-01|title=Top 200 Albums|date=July 1, 1995|publisher=[[Billboard 200]].

The [[Pulse (1995 film)|''Pulse'' DVD]] was released on 10 July 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe vinyl version was released as a four-LP [[box set]] and included \"One of These Days\" (also heard on the cassette release) as well as a large version of the photo booklet.\n\nThe original CD cover features an \"eye-like\" machine that has clock pieces inside, there is a planet in its centre, and on the outside it shows evolution as it moves backwards. It starts in the sea, moves to the bacteria which evolve into fishes, then into egg type creatures, then into eggs that hatch birds, and birds follow the trail of an aeroplane. There are six pyramids in the desert, and in the bottom of the sea, one can observe a city in the shore.\n\nThe debut of the album was highlighted by a light show from the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City with music [[simulcast]]ed on a New York City radio station.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==LED packaging==\nEarly CD versions came with a flashing red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] on the side of the case. This was designed by EMI contractor Jon Kempner, who was awarded the platinum disc, using the now discontinued LM3909 LED flasher IC. The circuit was powered by a single [[AA battery]]; the battery life was stated to be over six months. Some versions were also made with two AA batteries and later editions of the CD set did not feature the blinking LED.\n\n{{Quote|\"Essentially, it's a device which we thought was entertaining. It's an idea of [[Storm Thorgerson]]'s which related to ''Dark Side'' and the pulse, and it's a live album so the box is \"alive\". After that, in terms of seriously deep meanings, one might be struggling a bit.\"| [[Nick Mason]]|<ref>{{cite web | title=The 30 Year Technicolor Dream | author=Phil Sutcliffe | work=Mojo Magazine |

It was released on 29 May 1995 by [[EMI Records|EMI]] in the United Kingdom and on 6 June 1995 by [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in the United States.<ref name=\"emi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esounds.com/esounds/EN/Details.aspx?ProductID=M0724383270019&VariantID=0724383270026 |title=esounds |accessdate=8 July 2007 |publisher=EMI }}</ref> The album was recorded during the European leg of Pink Floyd's [[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell Tour]] in 1994.\n\n==Content and recording==\nThe album is notable for including a complete live version of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. It also features \"[[Astronomy Domine]]\", a [[Syd Barrett]] song not performed since the early 1970s. The track \"[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall, Part II]]\" features small portions of the songs \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part I\", \"[[The Happiest Days of Our Lives]]\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part III\". \"[[Take It Back]]\" was originally going to be on the album with the recording from 25 September 1994, [[Stade Olympique de la Pontaise]], [[Lausanne]] but was cut due to length.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nUnlike the previous live album ''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder]]'', no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio.<ref>James Guthrie confirmed this in an interview with Pink Floyd fanzine ''Brain Damage''.</ref> However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The album was mixed in [[QSound]], which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.\n\n==Release history==\nIn the United States, despite a price of $34.99 (which included flashing spine light and two AA batteries) ''Pulse'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] during the week of June 24, 1995 with 198,000 copies sold, it became the first multidisk album to top the ''Billboard'' 200 since the chart started using [[SoundScan]] data in May 1991.<ref name=\"BBdebut\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com.bo/books?id=zwsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92|title=Between The Bullets|last=Mayfield|first=Geoff|date=June 24, 1995|page=92|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|issn=0006-2510|volume=107|number=25}}</ref> The next week it fell off to number three on the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1995-07-01|title=Top 200 Albums|date=July 1, 1995|publisher=[[Billboard 200]].

The [[Pulse (1995 film)|''Pulse'' DVD]] was released on 10 July 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe vinyl version was released as a four-LP [[box set]] and included \"One of These Days\" (also heard on the cassette release) as well as a large version of the photo booklet.\n\nThe original CD cover features an \"eye-like\" machine that has clock pieces inside, there is a planet in its centre, and on the outside it shows evolution as it moves backwards. It starts in the sea, moves to the bacteria which evolve into fishes, then into egg type creatures, then into eggs that hatch birds, and birds follow the trail of an aeroplane. There are six pyramids in the desert, and in the bottom of the sea, one can observe a city in the shore.\n\nThe debut of the album was highlighted by a light show from the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City with music [[simulcast]]ed on a New York City radio station.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==LED packaging==\nEarly CD versions came with a flashing red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] on the side of the case. This was designed by EMI contractor Jon Kempner, who was awarded the platinum disc, using the now discontinued LM3909 LED flasher IC. The circuit was powered by a single [[AA battery]]; the battery life was stated to be over six months. Some versions were also made with two AA batteries and later editions of the CD set did not feature the blinking LED.\n\n{{Quote|\"Essentially, it's a device which we thought was entertaining. It's an idea of [[Storm Thorgerson]]'s which related to ''Dark Side'' and the pulse, and it's a live album so the box is \"alive\". After that, in terms of seriously deep meanings, one might be struggling a bit.\"| [[Nick Mason]]|<ref>{{cite web | title=The 30 Year Technicolor Dream | author=Phil Sutcliffe | work=Mojo Magazine |
