It was the 46th staging of [[Masters (snooker)|the Masters]] tournament, which was first held in [[1975 Masters (snooker)|1975]] and the second of three [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] events in the [[2019\u201320 snooker season|2019\u201320 season]], following the [[2019 UK Championship]] and preceding the [[2020 World Snooker Championship]]. The event featured the top 16 players from the [[snooker world rankings]] in a [[single-elimination tournament]]. It was organised by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] and was broadcast by the [[BBC]] and [[Eurosport]] in Europe.\n\nThe defending champion was [[Judd Trump]] who had defeated [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] 10\u20134 in the final of the [[2019 Masters (snooker)|previous year's event]]. In defence of his title, Trump lost to [[Shaun Murphy]] 3\u20136 in the first round. O'Sullivan was eligible to compete in the event, but chose not to participate; his entry was given to [[Ali Carter]], who reached the final where he played [[Stuart Bingham]]. Recovering from 5\u20137 behind, Bingham won the final 10\u20138 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at age&nbsp;43, beating the previous record set by [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1976 Masters (snooker)|1976]].\n\nIn winning the event, Bingham won [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000.

(also referred to as the '''2020 Dafabet Masters''' after the sponsor) was a professional non-ranking [[snooker]] tournament that took place between 12 and 19&nbsp;January 2020 at the [[Alexandra Palace]] in [[London]], England. It was the 46th staging of [[Masters (snooker)|the Masters]] tournament, which was first held in [[1975 Masters (snooker)|1975]] and the second of three [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] events in the [[2019\u201320 snooker season|2019\u201320 season]], following the [[2019 UK Championship]] and preceding the [[2020 World Snooker Championship]]. The event featured the top 16 players from the [[snooker world rankings]] in a [[single-elimination tournament]]. It was organised by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] and was broadcast by the [[BBC]] and [[Eurosport]] in Europe.\n\nThe defending champion was [[Judd Trump]] who had defeated [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] 10\u20134 in the final of the [[2019 Masters (snooker)|previous year's event]]. In defence of his title, Trump lost to [[Shaun Murphy]] 3\u20136 in the first round. O'Sullivan was eligible to compete in the event, but chose not to participate; his entry was given to [[Ali Carter]], who reached the final where he played [[Stuart Bingham]]. Recovering from 5\u20137 behind, Bingham won the final 10\u20138 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at age&nbsp;43, beating the previous record set by [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1976 Masters (snooker)|1976]].\n\nIn winning the event, Bingham won [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000. The tournament featured a total of 18 [[century break]]s; the highest break was a 144 compiled by [[David Gilbert (snooker player)|David Gilbert]] in the quarter-finals, for which he won \u00a315,000.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Ali Carter breaking off Masters final 2020.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a crowd behind a snooker table|The setup inside the [[Alexandra Palace]] during the tournament]]\n[[Masters (snooker)|The Masters]] is an invitational tournament that was first held in [[1975 Masters (snooker)|1975]], with the top-16 players from the snooker world rankings being invited to participate.<ref name=\"hYf7Y\" /><ref name=\"bbc._Mast\" /> The 2020 Masters was the second [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] event of the [[2019\u201320 snooker season]], following the [[2019 UK Championship]] and preceding the [[2020 World Snooker Championship]].<ref name=\"2pMvO\" /> The event was  held between 12 and 19&nbsp;January 2020.<ref name=\"radi_Mast\" /> The defending champion [[Judd Trump]], who won the [[2019 Masters (snooker)|2019 Masters]], was [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] first for the event; the remaining places were allocated according to the [[Snooker world rankings 2019/2020|world rankings]] after the UK Championship in December 2019.
