He and his friends lead happy lives in Chennai. Karthi comes across Anu (Nethra) in Pondicherry. She is brought by her NRI father (Bhanuchander), an extrovert. Karthi falls in love with Anu. Dejected at his love rejected by Anu, Karthi decides to take the extreme step. Eventually, he is saved by his friends. Anu comes to know of this and soon falls in love with him. It all boils down to a touchy climax. After knowing that Anu loves him, Karthi decides to spoil her life by spending a night with her and ditching her. Anu overhears his conversation with his friends, and yet continues to go as per Karthi's plan. His friend Abdullah (Suraj) advises him, but to no use. She spends a night with him in Pondicherry, and later reveals her awareness of his intentions. Anu marries Sree (Sreeman) and vows never to see Karthi again.\n\n==Cast==\n*Adithya\n*Nethra\n*Sriman\n*Bhanuchander\n\n==Soundtrack==\n*Eureka - Harish Raghavendra\n*Idhayam Irundha - Vinaya\n*Thoovanam - SPB\n*SMSla KAdhal -Naresh Iyer, Mahathi, Vinaya, Sathyan\n*Yedho Yedho - Parasuram\n*Yedho Yedho (2) - Anuradha Sriram\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Sify'' wrote \"It is supposed to be a love story with a difference, but 15 minutes in to the film you just can't fathom what's going on.
