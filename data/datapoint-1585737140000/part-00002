Permanent settlements at [[Mehrgarh]], currently in [[Balochistan]], to the west expanded into Sindh. This culture blossomed over several millennia and gave rise to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 3000 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization rivalled the contemporary civilizations of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] in size and scope, numbering nearly half a million inhabitants at its height with well-planned grid cities and sewer systems.\n\nThe primitive village communities in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] were still struggling against a difficult highland environment, a highly cultured people were trying to assert themselves at [[Kot Diji]]. This was one of the most developed urban civilizations of the ancient world. It flourished between the 25th and 15th centuries BC in the Indus valley sites of [[Mohenjo Daro]] and [[Harappa]]. The people had a high standard of art and craftsmanship and a well-developed system of quasi-pictographic writing which remains un-deciphered. The ruins of the well planned towns, the brick buildings of the common people, roads, public baths and the covered drainage system suggest a highly organized community.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/138 |title=Archaeological Ruins at Moanjodaro|author= |date= |website= The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) website |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some accounts, there is no evidence of large palaces or burial grounds for the elite.

Sindh was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. In the late 4th century BC, Sindh was conquered by a mixed army led by [[Macedon|Macedonian Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]]. The region remained under control of Greek satraps for only a few decades. After Alexander's death, there was a brief period of [[Seleucid]] rule, before Sindh was traded to the [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] in 305 BC. During the rule of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist religion]] spread to Sindh.\n\nMauryan rule ended in 185 BC with the overthrow of the last king by the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] Dynasty. In the disorder that followed, Greek rule returned when [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] led a [[Greco-Bactrian]] invasion of India and annexed most of the northwestern lands, including Sindh. Demetrius was later defeated and killed by a usurper, but his descendants continued to rule Sindh and other lands as the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. Under the reign of [[Menander I]], many Indo-Greeks followed his example and converted to Buddhism.\n\nIn the late 2nd century BC, [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribes shattered the Greco-Bactrian empire and invaded the Indo-Greek lands. Unable to take the [[Punjab region]], they invaded South Asia through Sindh, where they became known as [[Indo-Scythians]] (later [[Western Satraps]]). By the 1st century AD, the [[Kushan Empire]] annexed Sindh. [[Kushan]]s under [[Kanishka]] were great patrons of Buddhism and sponsored many building projects for local beliefs.<ref>which began about AD 127. \"Falk 2001, pp. 121\u2013136\", Falk (2001), pp. 121\u2013136, Falk, Harry (2004), pp. 167\u2013176 and Hill (2009), pp. 29, 33, 368\u2013371.</ref> [[Ahirs]] were also found in large numbers in Sindh.<ref name=\"Beames1970\">{{cite book|author=John Beames|title=A comparative grammar of the modern Aryan languages of India: to wit, Hindi, Panjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya and Bengali |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIddAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 March 2011|year=1970|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal}}</ref> [[Abiria]] country of [[Abhira tribe]] was in southern Sindh.<ref>Foreign influence on ancient India By Krishna Chandra Sagar</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&pg=PA122&dq=abiria+were+greeks#v=onepage&q=abiria%20&f=false |title=Foreign Influence on Ancient India \u2013 Krishna Chandra Sagar \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2012-08-03|isbn=9788172110284 |last1=Sagar |first1=Krishna Chandra |year=1992 }}</ref>\n\nThe Kushan Empire was defeated in the mid 3rd century AD by the [[Sassanid Empire]] of Persia, who installed vassals known as the [[Indo-Sassanian|Kushanshahs]] in these far eastern territories. These rulers were defeated by the [[Kidarites]] in the late 4th century.\n\nIt then came under the [[Gupta Empire]] after dealing with the Kidarites. By the late 5th century, attacks by [[Hephthalite]] tribes known as the Indo-Hephthalites or ''Hunas'' ([[Huns]]) broke through the Gupta Empire's northwestern borders and overran much of northwestern India. Concurrently, [[Ror dynasty]] ruled parts of the region for several centuries.\n\nAfterwards, Sindh came under the rule of Emperor [[Harshavardhan]], then the [[Rai Dynasty]] around 478. The Rais were overthrown by Chachar of [[Aror|Alor]] around 632.

The Umayyads appointed [[Habbari dynasty|Aziz al Habbari]] as the governor of Sindh. Habbaris ruled Sindh until [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] defeated the Habbaris in 1024. Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi viewed the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to be the caliphs thus he removed the remaining influence of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the region and Sindh fell to Abbasid control following the defeat of the Habbaris. The Abbasid Caliphate then appointed [[Khafif|Al Khafif]] from [[Samarra]]; 'Soomro' means 'of Samarra' in Sindhi. The new governor of Sindh was to create a better, stronger and stable government. Once he became the governor, he allotted several key positions to his family and friends; thus Al-Khafif or Sardar Khafif Soomro formed the [[Rajput]] [[Soomro Dynasty]] in Sindh;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=Data |website=www.uok.edu.pk }}</ref> and became its first ruler. Until the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] the Soomro dynasty was the Abbasid Caliphate's functionary in Sindh, but after that it became independent.\n\nWhen the [[Soomro dynasty]] lost ties with the Abbasid Caliphate after the Siege of Baghdad (1258,) the Soomra ruler Dodo-I established their rule from the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the north and in the east to [[Rajasthan]] and in the west to Pakistani [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. The [[Soomro]]s were one of the first indigenous Muslim dynasties in Sindh of [[Parmar]] [[Rajput]] origin.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=The Soomras of Sindh: their origin, main characteristics and rule \u2013 an overview (general survey) (1025 \u2013 1351 AD) |first=Habibullah |last=Siddiqui |journal=Literary Conference on Soomra Period in Sindh}}</ref> They were the first Muslims to translate the [[Quran]] into the [[Sindhi language]]. The Soomros created a chivalrous culture in Sindh, which eventually facilitated their rule centred at [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]]. It was later abandoned due to changes in the course of the Puran River; they ruled for the next 95 years until 1351. During this period, Kutch was ruled by the [[Samma Dynasty]], who enjoyed good relations with the Soomras in Sindh. Since the [[Soomro Dynasty]] lost its support from the Abbasid Caliphate, the Sultans of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] wanted a piece of Sindh. The Soomros successfully defended their kingdom for about 36 years, but their dynasties soon fell to the might of the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]'s massive armies such as the [[Tughluk]]s and the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]].\n\n=== Samma Dynasty period ===\n{{Main|Samma dynasty}}\n[[File:View of Makli by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Makli Hill]] is one of the largest necropolises in the world.]]\nIn 1339 [[Jam Unar]] founded a Sindhi [[Muslim Rajput]] [[Samma Dynasty]] and challenged the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultans of Delhi]]. He used the title of the ''Sultan of Sindh''. The [[Samma tribe]] reached its peak during the reign of [[Jam Nizamuddin II]] (also known by the nickname J\u00e1m Nind\u00f3). During his reign from 1461 to 1509, Nind\u00f3 greatly expanded the new capital of [[Thatta]] and its [[Makli]] hills, which replaced [[Debal]]. He patronized Sindhi art, architecture and culture. The Samma had left behind a popular legacy especially in architecture, music and art. Important court figures included the poet Kazi Kadal, [[Sardar Darya Khan]], Moltus Khan, Makhdoom Bilawal and the [[theologian]] Kazi Kaadan. However, Thatta was a port city; unlike garrison towns, it could not mobilize large armies against the [[Arghun]] and Tarkhan [[Mongol]] invaders, who killed many regional Sindhi [[Mirs]] and [[Amir]]s loyal to the Samma. Some parts of Sindh still remained under the Sultans of Delhi and the ruthless Arghuns and the [[Tarkhan]]s sacked Thatta during the rule of [[Jam Feroz]]udin.\n\n=== Migration of Baloch ===\n{{Main|Sindhi Baloch}}\nAccording to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], and Nadeem Wagan, [[General Manager]] at [[HANDS]], the [[Baloch people|Balochi]] migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in Sindh and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about {{convert|579|km}} from north to south and {{convert|442|km}} (extreme) or {{convert|281|km}} (average) from east to west, with an area of {{convert|140915|km2|sqmi}} of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the [[Thar Desert]] to the east, the [[Kirthar Mountains]] to the west and the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. In the centre is a fertile plain along the [[Indus River]].\n[[File:Sindhri Mango.JPG|alt=Sindhri mangoes is among top 10 mango varieties in the world|left|thumb|[[Sindhri]] is among top 10 [[mango varieties]] in the [[world]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/queen-of-mangoes-sindhri-from-pakistan-in-uae|title=Queen of Mangoes: Sindhri from Pakistan now in UAE|last=Menon|first=Sunita|website=Khaleej Times|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Blackbuck1-Kirthar National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Sindh ibex]] in [[Kirthar National Park]]]]\nThe province is mostly arid with scant vegetation except for the irrigated Indus Valley. The dwarf palm, ''Acacia Rupestris'' (kher), and ''[[Tecomella undulata]]'' ([[Rohida|lohirro]]) trees are typical of the western hill region. In the Indus valley, the ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (babul) (babbur) is the most dominant and occurs in thick forests along the Indus banks. The ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'' (neem) (nim), ''Zizyphys vulgaris'' (bir) (ber), ''Tamarix orientalis'' (jujuba lai) and ''[[Capparis aphylla]]'' (kirir) are among the more common trees.\n\nMango, date palms and the more recently introduced banana, guava, orange and [[chiku]] are the typical fruit-bearing trees. The coastal strip and the creeks abound in semi-aquatic and aquatic plants and the inshore Indus delta islands have forests of ''Avicennia tomentosa'' (timmer) and ''[[Ceriops tagal|Ceriops candolleana]]'' (chaunir) trees. Water lilies grow in abundance in the numerous lake and ponds, particularly in the lower Sindh region.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Sindh}}\n[[Image:Schnabeldelphin-drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Indus river dolphin]]\nAmong the wild animals, the [[Sindh ibex]] (sareh), [[blackbuck]], wild sheep ([[Urial]] or gadh) and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] are found in the western rocky range. The [[leopard]] is now rare and the [[Asiatic cheetah]] extinct. The [[Fishing cat|Pirrang]] (large tiger cat or fishing cat) of the eastern desert region is also disappearing. [[Chinkara|Deer]] occur in the lower rocky plains and in the eastern region, as do the striped [[hyena]] (charakh), [[jackal]], [[fox]], [[porcupine]], [[mongoose|common gray mongoose]] and [[hedgehog]]. The Sindhi phekari, red lynx or Caracal cat, is found in some areas. Phartho (hog deer) and wild bear occur, particularly in the central inundation belt. There are bats, lizards and reptiles, including the cobra, lundi (viper) and the mysterious Sindh [[krait]] of the Thar region, which is supposed to suck the victim's breath in his sleep.\nSome unusual sightings of Asian cheetah occurred in 2003 near the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] border in [[Kirthar Mountains]]. The rare [[houbara bustard]] find Sindh's warm climate suitable to rest and mate. Unfortunately, it is hunted by locals and foreigners.\n\nCrocodiles are rare and inhabit only the backwaters of the Indus, eastern Nara channel and Karachi backwater. Besides a large variety of marine fish, the plumbeous dolphin, the beaked dolphin, rorqual or blue whale and skates frequent the seas along the Sindh coast. The Pallo (Sable fish), a marine fish, ascends the Indus annually from February to April to spawn. The [[Indus river dolphin]] is among the most endangered species in Pakistan and is found in the part of the Indus river in northern Sindh. [[Indian hog deer|Hog deer]] and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] occur, particularly in the central inundation belt.\n\nAlthough Sindh has a [[semi arid]] climate, through its coastal and riverine forests, its huge fresh water lakes and mountains and deserts, Sindh supports a large amount of varied wildlife. Due to the semi-arid [[climate of Sindh]] the left out forests support an average population of jackals and snakes. The [[national parks]] established by the Government of Pakistan in collaboration with many organizations such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Sindh Wildlife Department]] support a huge variety of animals and birds. The [[Kirthar National Park]] in the Kirthar range spreads over more than 3000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of desert, stunted tree forests and a lake. The KNP supports [[Sindh ibex]], [[wild sheep]] (urial) and [[Asian black bear|black bear]] along with the rare leopard. There are also occasional sightings of The Sindhi phekari, ped lynx or Caracal cat. There is a project to introduce [[tiger]]s and [[Asian elephant]]s too in KNP near the huge Hub Dam Lake. Between July and November when the [[monsoon]] winds blow onshore from the ocean, giant [[olive ridley]] turtles lay their eggs along the seaward side. The turtles are protected species. After the mothers lay and leave them buried under the sands the SWD and WWF officials take the eggs and protect them until they are hatched to keep them from predators.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Sindh}}\n[[File:Ayub.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lansdowne Railway Bridge]]\nSindh lies in a [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region; it is hot in the summer and mild to warm in winter. Temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}} between May and August, and the minimum average temperature of {{convert|2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} occurs during December and January in the northern and higher elevated regions. The annual rainfall averages about seven inches, falling mainly during July and August. The southwest monsoon wind begins in mid-February and continues until the end of September, whereas the cool northerly wind blows during the winter months from October to January.\n\nSindh lies between the two [[monsoon]]s\u2014the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean and the northeast or retreating monsoon, deflected towards it by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountains]]\u2014and escapes the influence of both. The region's scarcity of rainfall is compensated by the inundation of the Indus twice a year, caused by the spring and summer melting of Himalayan snow and by rainfall in the monsoon season.\n\nSindh is divided into three climatic regions: Siro (the upper region, centred on [[Jacobabad]]), Wicholo (the middle region, centred on [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]), and Lar (the lower region, centred on [[Karachi]]). The [[thermal equator]] passes through upper Sindh, where the air is generally very dry. Central Sindh's temperatures are generally lower than those of upper Sindh but higher than those of lower Sindh. Dry hot days and cool nights are typical during the summer. Central Sindh's maximum temperature typically reaches {{convert|43|-|44|C|F}}. Lower Sindh has a damper and humid maritime climate affected by the southwestern winds in summer and northeastern winds in winter, with lower [[rainfall]] than Central Sindh. Lower Sindh's maximum temperature reaches about {{convert|35|-|38|C|F}}. In the Kirthar range at {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} and higher at [[Gorakh Hill]] and other peaks in [[Dadu District]], temperatures near freezing have been recorded and brief snowfall is received in the winters.\n\n== Major cities ==\n{{Main|List of most populous cities in Pakistan|List of cities in Sindh|List of cities in Sindh by population}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 70%; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| '''List of major cities in Sindh'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| Rank\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| City\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| District(s)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| Population\n\n! rowspan=11 width:150|\n<br/>[[File:Tomb Jinnah.jpg|border|80px]]<br/>[[Karachi]]<br/>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 1 ||align=left | '''[[Karachi]]''' ||align=left | [[Karachi East District|Karachi East]]<br/>[[Karachi West District|Karachi West]]<br/>[[Karachi South District|Karachi South]]<br/>[[Karachi Central District|Karachi Central]]<br/>[[Malir District|Malir]]<br/>[[Korangi District|Korangi]] || 14,910,352\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 2 ||align=left | '''[[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]''' ||align=left | [[Hyderabad District, Pakistan|Hyderabad]] || 1,732,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 3 ||align=left | '''[[Sukkur]]''' ||align=left | [[Sukkur District|Sukkur]] || 1,400,000\n|-\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5f5f5;\"| '''Source: Pakistan Census 2017<ref name=census>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbscensus.gov.pk |title=Pakistan Bureau of Statistics \u2013 6th Population and Housing Census |website=www.pbscensus.gov.pk}}</ref>'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5f5f5;\"| '''This is a list of each city's urban populations and does not indicate total district populations'''\n|}\n\n== Government ==\n=== Sindh province ===\n{| class=\"infobox borderless\"\n|+ Provincial symbols of Sindh<ref name=\"Faiza Ilyas\">{{cite news|last1=Ilyas|first1=Faiza|title=Provincial mammal, bird notified|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/733088|accessdate=3 November 2016|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=10 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/978487/govt-declares-neem-provincial-tree|title=Govt declares Neem 'provincial tree'|author= |date=April 15, 2010 |website= Dawn|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/12/14/city/karachi/%E2%80%98our-sindhi-symbols-%E2%80%93-ibex-black-partridge%E2%80%99/|title=Our Sindhi symbols \u2013 ibex, black partridge|author=Amar Guriro |date=December 14, 2011 |website= Pakistan Today|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Perhaps the most professed exposition of Sindhi culture is in the handicrafts of [[Haala|Hala]], a town some 30 kilometres from [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]. Hala's artisans manufacture high-quality and impressively priced wooden handicrafts, textiles, paintings, handmade paper products, and blue pottery. Lacquered wood works known as Jandi, painting on wood, tiles, and pottery known as Kashi, hand weaved textiles including ''[[khadi]]'', ''susi'', and ''[[ajrak]]s'' are synonymous with Sindhi culture preserved in Hala's handicraft.\n\nThe work of Sindhi artisans was sold in ancient markets of Damascus, Baghdad, Basra, Istanbul, Cairo and Samarkand. Referring to the lacquer work on wood locally known as Jandi, T. Posten (an English traveller who visited Sindh in the early 19th century) asserted that the articles of Hala could be compared with exquisite specimens of China. Technological improvements such as the spinning wheel ([[Charkha (spinning wheel)|charkha]]) and treadle (pai-chah) in the weaver's loom were gradually introduced and the processes of designing, dyeing and printing by block were refined. The refined, lightweight, colourful, washable fabrics from Hala became a luxury for people used to the woollens and linens of the age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wishwebdesign.com/dgaewm/otherinfo/Cultural-Heritage/542/533|title=Cultural Heritage|author= |date=|website=wishwebdesign.com = |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the World Wildlife Fund, Pakistan,  play an important role to promote the culture of Sindh. They provide training to women artisans in the interior of Sindh so they get a source of income. They promote their products under the name of \"Crafts Forever\". Many women in rural Sindh are skilled in the production of caps. Sindhi caps are manufactured commercially on a small scale at New Saeedabad and Hala New.

Permanent settlements at [[Mehrgarh]], currently in [[Balochistan]], to the west expanded into Sindh. This culture blossomed over several millennia and gave rise to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 3000 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization rivalled the contemporary civilizations of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] in size and scope, numbering nearly half a million inhabitants at its height with well-planned grid cities and sewer systems.\n\nThe primitive village communities in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] were still struggling against a difficult highland environment, a highly cultured people were trying to assert themselves at [[Kot Diji]]. This was one of the most developed urban civilizations of the ancient world. It flourished between the 25th and 15th centuries BC in the Indus valley sites of [[Mohenjo Daro]] and [[Harappa]]. The people had a high standard of art and craftsmanship and a well-developed system of quasi-pictographic writing which remains un-deciphered. The ruins of the well planned towns, the brick buildings of the common people, roads, public baths and the covered drainage system suggest a highly organized community.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/138 |title=Archaeological Ruins at Moanjodaro|author= |date= |website= The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) website |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some accounts, there is no evidence of large palaces or burial grounds for the elite.

Sindh was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. In the late 4th century BC, Sindh was conquered by a mixed army led by [[Macedon|Macedonian Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]]. The region remained under control of Greek satraps for only a few decades. After Alexander's death, there was a brief period of [[Seleucid]] rule, before Sindh was traded to the [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] in 305 BC. During the rule of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist religion]] spread to Sindh.\n\nMauryan rule ended in 185 BC with the overthrow of the last king by the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] Dynasty. In the disorder that followed, Greek rule returned when [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] led a [[Greco-Bactrian]] invasion of India and annexed most of the northwestern lands, including Sindh. Demetrius was later defeated and killed by a usurper, but his descendants continued to rule Sindh and other lands as the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. Under the reign of [[Menander I]], many Indo-Greeks followed his example and converted to Buddhism.\n\nIn the late 2nd century BC, [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribes shattered the Greco-Bactrian empire and invaded the Indo-Greek lands. Unable to take the [[Punjab region]], they invaded South Asia through Sindh, where they became known as [[Indo-Scythians]] (later [[Western Satraps]]). By the 1st century AD, the [[Kushan Empire]] annexed Sindh.

These rulers were defeated by the [[Kidarites]] in the late 4th century.\n\nIt then came under the [[Gupta Empire]] after dealing with the Kidarites. By the late 5th century, attacks by [[Hephthalite]] tribes known as the Indo-Hephthalites or ''Hunas'' ([[Huns]]) broke through the Gupta Empire's northwestern borders and overran much of northwestern India. Concurrently, [[Ror dynasty]] ruled parts of the region for several centuries.\n\nAfterwards, Sindh came under the rule of Emperor [[Harshavardhan]], then the [[Rai Dynasty]] around 478. The Rais were overthrown by Chachar of [[Aror|Alor]] around 632.

The Umayyads appointed [[Habbari dynasty|Aziz al Habbari]] as the governor of Sindh. Habbaris ruled Sindh until [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] defeated the Habbaris in 1024. Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi viewed the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to be the caliphs thus he removed the remaining influence of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the region and Sindh fell to Abbasid control following the defeat of the Habbaris. The Abbasid Caliphate then appointed [[Khafif|Al Khafif]] from [[Samarra]]; 'Soomro' means 'of Samarra' in Sindhi. The new governor of Sindh was to create a better, stronger and stable government. Once he became the governor, he allotted several key positions to his family and friends; thus Al-Khafif or Sardar Khafif Soomro formed the [[Rajput]] [[Soomro Dynasty]] in Sindh;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=Data |website=www.uok.edu.pk }}</ref> and became its first ruler. Until the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] the Soomro dynasty was the Abbasid Caliphate's functionary in Sindh, but after that it became independent.\n\nWhen the [[Soomro dynasty]] lost ties with the Abbasid Caliphate after the Siege of Baghdad (1258,) the Soomra ruler Dodo-I established their rule from the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the north and in the east to [[Rajasthan]] and in the west to Pakistani [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. The [[Soomro]]s were one of the first indigenous Muslim dynasties in Sindh of [[Parmar]] [[Rajput]] origin.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=The Soomras of Sindh: their origin, main characteristics and rule \u2013 an overview (general survey) (1025 \u2013 1351 AD) |first=Habibullah |last=Siddiqui |journal=Literary Conference on Soomra Period in Sindh}}</ref> They were the first Muslims to translate the [[Quran]] into the [[Sindhi language]]. The Soomros created a chivalrous culture in Sindh, which eventually facilitated their rule centred at [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]]. It was later abandoned due to changes in the course of the Puran River; they ruled for the next 95 years until 1351. During this period, Kutch was ruled by the [[Samma Dynasty]], who enjoyed good relations with the Soomras in Sindh. Since the [[Soomro Dynasty]] lost its support from the Abbasid Caliphate, the Sultans of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] wanted a piece of Sindh. The Soomros successfully defended their kingdom for about 36 years, but their dynasties soon fell to the might of the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]'s massive armies such as the [[Tughluk]]s and the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]].\n\n=== Samma Dynasty period ===\n{{Main|Samma dynasty}}\n[[File:View of Makli by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Makli Hill]] is one of the largest necropolises in the world.]]\nIn 1339 [[Jam Unar]] founded a Sindhi [[Muslim Rajput]] [[Samma Dynasty]] and challenged the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultans of Delhi]]. He used the title of the ''Sultan of Sindh''. The [[Samma tribe]] reached its peak during the reign of [[Jam Nizamuddin II]] (also known by the nickname J\u00e1m Nind\u00f3). During his reign from 1461 to 1509, Nind\u00f3 greatly expanded the new capital of [[Thatta]] and its [[Makli]] hills, which replaced [[Debal]]. He patronized Sindhi art, architecture and culture. The Samma had left behind a popular legacy especially in architecture, music and art. Important court figures included the poet Kazi Kadal, [[Sardar Darya Khan]], Moltus Khan, Makhdoom Bilawal and the [[theologian]] Kazi Kaadan. However, Thatta was a port city; unlike garrison towns, it could not mobilize large armies against the [[Arghun]] and Tarkhan [[Mongol]] invaders, who killed many regional Sindhi [[Mirs]] and [[Amir]]s loyal to the Samma. Some parts of Sindh still remained under the Sultans of Delhi and the ruthless Arghuns and the [[Tarkhan]]s sacked Thatta during the rule of [[Jam Feroz]]udin.\n\n=== Migration of Baloch ===\n{{Main|Sindhi Baloch}}\nAccording to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], and Nadeem Wagan, [[General Manager]] at [[HANDS]], the [[Baloch people|Balochi]] migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in Sindh and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about {{convert|579|km}} from north to south and {{convert|442|km}} (extreme) or {{convert|281|km}} (average) from east to west, with an area of {{convert|140915|km2|sqmi}} of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the [[Thar Desert]] to the east, the [[Kirthar Mountains]] to the west and the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. In the centre is a fertile plain along the [[Indus River]].\n[[File:Sindhri Mango.JPG|alt=Sindhri mangoes is among top 10 mango varieties in the world|left|thumb|[[Sindhri]] is among top 10 [[mango varieties]] in the [[world]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/queen-of-mangoes-sindhri-from-pakistan-in-uae|title=Queen of Mangoes: Sindhri from Pakistan now in UAE|last=Menon|first=Sunita|website=Khaleej Times|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Blackbuck1-Kirthar National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Sindh ibex]] in [[Kirthar National Park]]]]\nThe province is mostly arid with scant vegetation except for the irrigated Indus Valley. The dwarf palm, ''Acacia Rupestris'' (kher), and ''[[Tecomella undulata]]'' ([[Rohida|lohirro]]) trees are typical of the western hill region. In the Indus valley, the ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (babul) (babbur) is the most dominant and occurs in thick forests along the Indus banks. The ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'' (neem) (nim), ''Zizyphys vulgaris'' (bir) (ber), ''Tamarix orientalis'' (jujuba lai) and ''[[Capparis aphylla]]'' (kirir) are among the more common trees.\n\nMango, date palms and the more recently introduced banana, guava, orange and [[chiku]] are the typical fruit-bearing trees. The coastal strip and the creeks abound in semi-aquatic and aquatic plants and the inshore Indus delta islands have forests of ''Avicennia tomentosa'' (timmer) and ''[[Ceriops tagal|Ceriops candolleana]]'' (chaunir) trees. Water lilies grow in abundance in the numerous lake and ponds, particularly in the lower Sindh region.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Sindh}}\n[[Image:Schnabeldelphin-drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Indus river dolphin]]\nAmong the wild animals, the [[Sindh ibex]] (sareh), [[blackbuck]], wild sheep ([[Urial]] or gadh) and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] are found in the western rocky range. The [[leopard]] is now rare and the [[Asiatic cheetah]] extinct. The [[Fishing cat|Pirrang]] (large tiger cat or fishing cat) of the eastern desert region is also disappearing. [[Chinkara|Deer]] occur in the lower rocky plains and in the eastern region, as do the striped [[hyena]] (charakh), [[jackal]], [[fox]], [[porcupine]], [[mongoose|common gray mongoose]] and [[hedgehog]]. The Sindhi phekari, red lynx or Caracal cat, is found in some areas. Phartho (hog deer) and wild bear occur, particularly in the central inundation belt. There are bats, lizards and reptiles, including the cobra, lundi (viper) and the mysterious Sindh [[krait]] of the Thar region, which is supposed to suck the victim's breath in his sleep.\nSome unusual sightings of Asian cheetah occurred in 2003 near the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] border in [[Kirthar Mountains]]. The rare [[houbara bustard]] find Sindh's warm climate suitable to rest and mate. Unfortunately, it is hunted by locals and foreigners.\n\nCrocodiles are rare and inhabit only the backwaters of the Indus, eastern Nara channel and Karachi backwater. Besides a large variety of marine fish, the plumbeous dolphin, the beaked dolphin, rorqual or blue whale and skates frequent the seas along the Sindh coast. The Pallo (Sable fish), a marine fish, ascends the Indus annually from February to April to spawn. The [[Indus river dolphin]] is among the most endangered species in Pakistan and is found in the part of the Indus river in northern Sindh. [[Indian hog deer|Hog deer]] and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] occur, particularly in the central inundation belt.\n\nAlthough Sindh has a [[semi arid]] climate, through its coastal and riverine forests, its huge fresh water lakes and mountains and deserts, Sindh supports a large amount of varied wildlife. Due to the semi-arid [[climate of Sindh]] the left out forests support an average population of jackals and snakes. The [[national parks]] established by the Government of Pakistan in collaboration with many organizations such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Sindh Wildlife Department]] support a huge variety of animals and birds. The [[Kirthar National Park]] in the Kirthar range spreads over more than 3000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of desert, stunted tree forests and a lake. The KNP supports [[Sindh ibex]], [[wild sheep]] (urial) and [[Asian black bear|black bear]] along with the rare leopard. There are also occasional sightings of The Sindhi phekari, ped lynx or Caracal cat. There is a project to introduce [[tiger]]s and [[Asian elephant]]s too in KNP near the huge Hub Dam Lake. Between July and November when the [[monsoon]] winds blow onshore from the ocean, giant [[olive ridley]] turtles lay their eggs along the seaward side. The turtles are protected species. After the mothers lay and leave them buried under the sands the SWD and WWF officials take the eggs and protect them until they are hatched to keep them from predators.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Sindh}}\n[[File:Ayub.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lansdowne Railway Bridge]]\nSindh lies in a [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region; it is hot in the summer and mild to warm in winter. Temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}} between May and August, and the minimum average temperature of {{convert|2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} occurs during December and January in the northern and higher elevated regions. The annual rainfall averages about seven inches, falling mainly during July and August. The southwest monsoon wind begins in mid-February and continues until the end of September, whereas the cool northerly wind blows during the winter months from October to January.\n\nSindh lies between the two [[monsoon]]s\u2014the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean and the northeast or retreating monsoon, deflected towards it by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountains]]\u2014and escapes the influence of both. The region's scarcity of rainfall is compensated by the inundation of the Indus twice a year, caused by the spring and summer melting of Himalayan snow and by rainfall in the monsoon season.\n\nSindh is divided into three climatic regions: Siro (the upper region, centred on [[Jacobabad]]), Wicholo (the middle region, centred on [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]), and Lar (the lower region, centred on [[Karachi]]). The [[thermal equator]] passes through upper Sindh, where the air is generally very dry. Central Sindh's temperatures are generally lower than those of upper Sindh but higher than those of lower Sindh. Dry hot days and cool nights are typical during the summer. Central Sindh's maximum temperature typically reaches {{convert|43|-|44|C|F}}.

Hala's artisans manufacture high-quality and impressively priced wooden handicrafts, textiles, paintings, handmade paper products, and blue pottery. Lacquered wood works known as Jandi, painting on wood, tiles, and pottery known as Kashi, hand weaved textiles including ''[[khadi]]'', ''susi'', and ''[[ajrak]]s'' are synonymous with Sindhi culture preserved in Hala's handicraft.\n\nThe work of Sindhi artisans was sold in ancient markets of Damascus, Baghdad, Basra, Istanbul, Cairo and Samarkand. Referring to the lacquer work on wood locally known as Jandi, T. Posten (an English traveller who visited Sindh in the early 19th century) asserted that the articles of Hala could be compared with exquisite specimens of China. Technological improvements such as the spinning wheel ([[Charkha (spinning wheel)|charkha]]) and treadle (pai-chah) in the weaver's loom were gradually introduced and the processes of designing, dyeing and printing by block were refined. The refined, lightweight, colourful, washable fabrics from Hala became a luxury for people used to the woollens and linens of the age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wishwebdesign.com/dgaewm/otherinfo/Cultural-Heritage/542/533|title=Cultural Heritage|author= |date=|website=wishwebdesign.com = |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the World Wildlife Fund, Pakistan,  play an important role to promote the culture of Sindh. They provide training to women artisans in the interior of Sindh so they get a source of income. They promote their products under the name of \"Crafts Forever\". Many women in rural Sindh are skilled in the production of caps. Sindhi caps are manufactured commercially on a small scale at New Saeedabad and Hala New. These are in demand with visitors from Karachi and other places; however, these manufacturing units have a limited production capacity. Sindhi people began celebrating Sindhi Topi Day on December 6, 2009, to preserve the historical culture of Sindh by wearing Ajrak and Sindhi topi.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/13+sindh+celebrates+first+ever+sindhi+topi+day-za-04|title= Sindh celebrates first ever 'Sindhi Topi Day'}}</ref>\n\n[[File:House in the Thar.JPG|thumb|Huts in the Thar desert]]\n\n== Places of interest ==\n{{See also|Places of historical interest in Sindh}}\n\nTourist sites include the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] near the city of [[Larkana]], Runi Kot, Kot Deji, the Jain temples of Nangar Parker and the historic temple of Sadhu Bela, Sukkur.
