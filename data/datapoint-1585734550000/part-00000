[[Bob Kasten|Robert Kasten, Jr.]] (R-Wl) was the primary sponsor of S 875, and Rep. [[Tom Lantos]] sponsored HR 2145. In a nutshell, recognition by any UN body of the Palestinians' right to statehood or their achievement of statehood status would trigger a suspension of US funding to the \"offending\" UN body under these laws. (I'll just note in passing that it was Sen. Kasten who was to be a major recipient of campaign funds that [[AIPAC]]'s President [[David Steiner (AIPAC)|David Steiner]] was soliciting from one Haim Katz. Katz surreptitiously taped and released to the public the conversation, much to AIPAC's embarrassment.

bodies==\n\n===Director-General===\nThere has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.\n\nThe Directors-General of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Directors-General since inception, women have held the position only twice. [[Qatar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Iran]] are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The [[ASEAN]] bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Madagascar]] are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.\n\nThe list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:<ref>UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ Directors-General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718234457/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ |date=18 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Country\n!Term\n|-\n| [[Audrey Azoulay]] || {{flagcountry|FRA}} || 2017\u2013present\n|-\n| [[Irina Bokova]] || {{flagcountry|BUL}} || 2009\u20132017\n|-\n| [[Ko\u00efchiro Matsuura]] || {{flagcountry|JPN}} || 1999\u20132009\n|-\n| [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]] || {{flagcountry|ESP}} || 1987\u201399\n|-\n| [[Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow]] || {{flagcountry|SEN}} || 1974\u201387\n|-\n| [[Ren\u00e9 Maheu]] || {{flagcountry|FRA}} || 1961\u201374; [[acting (law)|acting]] 1961\n|-\n| [[Vittorino Veronese]] || {{flagcountry|ITA}} || 1958\u201361\n|-\n| [[Luther Evans]] || {{flagcountry|USA|1912}} || 1953\u201358\n|-\n| [[John Wilkinson Taylor (educator)|John Wilkinson Taylor]] || {{flagcountry|USA|1912}} || [[acting (law)|acting]] 1952\u201353\n|-\n| [[Jaime Torres Bodet]] || {{flagcountry|MEX|1934}} || 1948\u201352\n|-\n| [[Julian Huxley]] || {{flagcountry|UK}} || 1946\u201348\n|}\n\n===General Conference===\nThis is the list of the sessions of the UNESCO General Conference held since 1946:<ref>UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference/previous-sessions/ Previous Sessions of the General Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025045200/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference/previous-sessions/ |date=25 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] (UNCIO), held in San Francisco in April\u2013June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London 1\u201316 November 1945 with 44 governments represented.

In a nutshell, recognition by any UN body of the Palestinians' right to statehood or their achievement of statehood status would trigger a suspension of US funding to the \"offending\" UN body under these laws. (I'll just note in passing that it was Sen. Kasten who was to be a major recipient of campaign funds that [[AIPAC]]'s President [[David Steiner (AIPAC)|David Steiner]] was soliciting from one Haim Katz. Katz surreptitiously taped and released to the public the conversation, much to AIPAC's embarrassment. The conversation can be found on-line and makes for an interesting read.)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. stops UNESCO funding over Palestinian vote|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-unesco-usa-funding/u-s-stops-unesco-funding-over-palestinian-vote-idUSTRE79U5ED20111031|publisher=Reuters |date=October 31, 2011 |access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref> As a result, the US withdrew its funding, which had accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/world/middleeast/unesco-approves-full-membership-for-palestinians.html |title= Unesco Approves Full Membership for Palestinians |first1= Steven |last1= Erlanger |first2= Scott |last2= Sayare |work= The New York Times |date= 31 October 2011 |accessdate= 31 October 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111031171156/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/world/middleeast/unesco-approves-full-membership-for-palestinians.html |archive-date= 31 October 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israeli payments to UNESCO and imposing sanctions on the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]],<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/after-unesco-vote-israeli-sanctions-on-palestinian-authority-anger-u-s-1.393600|title= After UNESCO vote, Israeli sanctions on Palestinian Authority anger U.S.|work= Haaretz|date= 4 November 2011|accessdate= 11 December 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111207205936/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/after-unesco-vote-israeli-sanctions-on-palestinian-authority-anger-u-s-1.393600|archive-date= 7 December 2011|url-status= live}}</ref> stating that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental \"to potential peace talks\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-03/middleeast/world_meast_israel-unesco_1_unesco-palestinian-bid-palestinian-state?_s=PM:MIDDLEEAST |publisher=CNN |title=Israel freezes UNESCO funds |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106053150/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-03/middleeast/world_meast_israel-unesco_1_unesco-palestinian-bid-palestinian-state?_s=PM:MIDDLEEAST |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Two years after they stopped paying their dues to UNESCO, the US and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected; thus, the US was elected as a member of the Executive Board for the period 2016\u201319.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/08/us-unesco-idUSBRE9A70I320131108 | title= U.S., Israel lose voting rights at UNESCO over Palestine row | work= Reuters | date= 8 November 2013 | accessdate= 29 June 2014 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140709192541/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/08/us-unesco-idUSBRE9A70I320131108 | archive-date= 9 July 2014 | url-status= live }}</ref>  In 2019, Israel left UNESCO after 69 years of membership, with Israel's ambassador to the UN [[Danny Danon]] writing: \"UNESCO is the body that continually rewrites history, including by erasing the Jewish connection to Jerusalem... it is corrupted and manipulated by Israel's enemies... we are not going to be a member of an organisation that deliberately acts against us\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/202003121078544477-israel-should-quit-putting-up-with-uns-triple-standards---ex-israeli-diplomat/ |title=Israel Should Quit Putting up With UN's 'Triple' Standards - Ex-Israeli Diplomat - Sputnik International |publisher=Sputniknews.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:UNESCO Bras\u00edlia Office.jpg|thumb|UNESCO offices in [[Bras\u00edlia]]]]\n\nUNESCO implements its activities through the five programme areas: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.\n* Education: UNESCO supports research in [[comparative education]]; and provide expertise and fosters partnerships to strengthen national educational leadership and the capacity of countries to offer quality education for all.

bodies==\n\n===Director-General===\nThere has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.\n\nThe Directors-General of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Directors-General since inception, women have held the position only twice. [[Qatar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Iran]] are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The [[ASEAN]] bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Madagascar]] are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.\n\nThe list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:<ref>UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ Directors-General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718234457/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ |date=18 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Country\n!Term\n|-\n| [[Audrey Azoulay]] || {{flagcountry|FRA}} || 2017\u2013present\n|-\n| [[Irina Bokova]] || {{flagcountry|BUL}} || 2009\u20132017\n|-\n| [[Ko\u00efchiro Matsuura]] || {{flagcountry|JPN}} || 1999\u20132009\n|-\n| [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]] || {{flagcountry|ESP}} || 1987\u201399\n|-\n| [[Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow]] || {{flagcountry|SEN}} || 1974\u201387\n|-\n| [[Ren\u00e9 Maheu]] || {{flagcountry|FRA}} || 1961\u201374; [[acting (law)|acting]] 1961\n|-\n| [[Vittorino Veronese]] || {{flagcountry|ITA}} || 1958\u201361\n|-\n| [[Luther Evans]] || {{flagcountry|USA|1912}} || 1953\u201358\n|-\n| [[John Wilkinson Taylor (educator)|John Wilkinson Taylor]] || {{flagcountry|USA|1912}} || [[acting (law)|acting]] 1952\u201353\n|-\n| [[Jaime Torres Bodet]] || {{flagcountry|MEX|1934}} || 1948\u201352\n|-\n| [[Julian Huxley]] || {{flagcountry|UK}} || 1946\u201348\n|}\n\n===General Conference===\nThis is the list of the sessions of the UNESCO General Conference held since 1946:<ref>UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference/previous-sessions/ Previous Sessions of the General Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025045200/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference/previous-sessions/ |date=25 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
