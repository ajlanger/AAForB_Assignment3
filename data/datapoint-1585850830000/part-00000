The descendants\n\nRam Navami celebrates the birth of the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ram appeared in Ayodhya as the son of King Dasharath and Queen Kaushalya in the Raghu Kula (Solar Dynasty). He was born on the ninth day of Chaitra month in the noon. This day coincides with the ninth day of Chaitra Navratri, on which is the day when the fasting concludes. As per the Gregorian calendar, the festival falls in the month of March or April.\n\nThe celebration of Ram Navami is done with devotion and joy. The house is decorated and Deity idols are beautifully decorated with flowers, clothes and jewels. The celebrations include fasting, singing of devotional songs, visiting temple and recitation of hymns from Ram Charitmanas. In some places, the celebrations start from the first day of Chaitra Navratri until Navami. While Ram Lila- a theatrical enactment of Ramayana, recitation of Ramayan, chariot procession of Ram, Sita and Laxman idols is done, discourse on Ramayana by story-tellers and satsangs are organized at few places.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Public holidays in India]]\n* [[List of Hindu festivals]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ramanavami}}\n[https://www.kitpiks.com/why-do-we-celebrate-rama-navami/ Why do we celebrate Rama Navami?]{{Ramayana}}\n{{Hindu Festivals}}\n{{Hindudharma}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu festivals]]\n[[Category:Hindu holy days]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Religious festivals in India]]\n[[Category:Religious festivals in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nepal]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism]]\n[[Category:Ramayana]]\n[[Category:Vrata]]\n[[Category:Birthdays]]\n[[Category:Hindu festivals in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Spring festival that celebrates the birthday of the Hindu God Rama}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n''{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}''\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name  = Rama Navami\n|type          = Hindu\n|image         = File:Ram Lalla in Shwetambar.JPG\n|caption       = Baby [[Rama]] (Ram Lalla)\n|significance  = Birthday of [[Rama]]\n|date        = Ninth day of [[Chaitra]] (Chaitra [[Shukla Paksha]] Navami)\n|date2019 = 14 April (Sun)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.gov.in/calendar?date=2019-04|title=National Portal of India|website=www.india.gov.in|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n|date2020 = 2 April (Thu)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.gov.in/calendar?date=2020-04|title=National Portal of India|website=www.india.gov.in|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n|celebrations  = Last day of Chaitra [[Navratri]]\n|observances   = [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], [[Vrata]] (fast), [[Ramayana]] [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha recitation]], [[Homa (ritual)|Havan]], [[D\u0101na]] (charity), [[Music Festival]]\n|frequency     = Annual\n}}\n'''Rama Navami''' is a spring [[Hindu]] festival that celebrates the birthday of the Hindu God Lord [[Rama]].\nHe is particularly important to the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of [[Hinduism]], as the seventh [[avatar]] of God [[Vishnu]].<ref name=bbc/><ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=175953 The nine-day festival of Navratri leading up to Sri Rama Navami has bhajans, kirtans and discourses in store for devotees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407143924/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=175953 |date= 7 April 2009 }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', Friday , 31 March 2006.</ref> The festival celebrates the descent of Vishnu as shri Rama avatar, through his birth to King [[Dasharatha]] and Queen [[Kausalya]] in [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]].<ref name=dna8apr2014/> The festival is a part of the spring [[Navratri]], and falls on the ninth day of the bright half ([[Paksha|Shukla Paksha]]) in the [[Hindu calendar]] month of [[Chaitra]].

The descendants\n\nRam Navami celebrates the birth of the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ram appeared in Ayodhya as the son of King Dasharath and Queen Kaushalya in the Raghu Kula (Solar Dynasty). He was born on the ninth day of Chaitra month in the noon. This day coincides with the ninth day of Chaitra Navratri, on which is the day when the fasting concludes. As per the Gregorian calendar, the festival falls in the month of March or April.\n\nThe celebration of Ram Navami is done with devotion and joy. The house is decorated and Deity idols are beautifully decorated with flowers, clothes and jewels. The celebrations include fasting, singing of devotional songs, visiting temple and recitation of hymns from Ram Charitmanas. In some places, the celebrations start from the first day of Chaitra Navratri until Navami. While Ram Lila- a theatrical enactment of Ramayana, recitation of Ramayan, chariot procession of Ram, Sita and Laxman idols is done, discourse on Ramayana by story-tellers and satsangs are organized at few places.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Public holidays in India]]\n* [[List of Hindu festivals]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ramanavami}}\n[https://www.kitpiks.com/why-do-we-celebrate-rama-navami/ Why do we celebrate Rama Navami?]{{Ramayana}}\n{{Hindu Festivals}}\n{{Hindudharma}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu festivals]]\n[[Category:Hindu holy days]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Religious festivals in India]]\n[[Category:Religious festivals in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nepal]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism]]\n[[Category:Ramayana]]\n[[Category:Vrata]]\n[[Category:Birthdays]]\n[[Category:Hindu festivals in India]]\n", "name_user": "Minaamullah", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWhy Do Ram Navami Celebrated", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama_Navami"}
