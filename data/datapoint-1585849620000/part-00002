Having left school at age twelve to help on the family farm, he apprenticed as a pastry chef in Paris three years later. In 1855, he enlisted in the army for seven years and fought in the [[Crimean War]]. In 1859, during the war in [[Italy]] against the [[Austria|Austrian]]s. After he was wounded at the [[Battle of Magenta]], he was taken prisoner. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he was a second lieutenant in the 50<sup>e</sup> r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne. Taken prisoner again, he was sent to [[Magdeburg]] in [[Saxony]] where he learned [[German language|German]].\n\nIn 1871, he published ''La natation ou l\u2019art de nager appris seul en moins d\u2019une heure'' (''Learning the art of swimming alone in less than an hour''), then resigned from the Army and moved to [[Marseilles]]. Here he filed a [[patent]] for the \"airlift swimming trunks and belt with a double compensatory reservoir\". This commercial endeavor was a complete failure. He returned to Magdeburg, where he earned his living as a language teacher, developing a method for learning French, which he [[self-published]] in 1874.\n\nBrisset became [[stationmaster]] at the [[railway station]] of [[Angers]], and later of [[L'Aigle]]. After publishing another book on the French language, he undertook his major philosophical work, in which contended that humans were descended from [[frogs]]. Brisset supported his contention by comparing the French and frog languages (such as \"logement\" = dwelling, comes from \"l'eau\" = water). He was serious about his \"morosophy\", and authored a number of books and pamphlets put forth his indisputable substantiations, which he had printed and distributed at his own expense.\n\nIn 1912, novelist [[Jules Romains]], who had obtained copies of ''God's Mystery'' and ''The Human Origins'', set up, with the help of fellow hoaxers, a rigged election for a \"Prince of Thinkers\". Unsurprisingly, Brisset got elected. The Election Committee then called Brisset to Paris in 1913, where he was received and acclaimed with great pomp. He partook in several ceremonies and a banquet and uttered emotional words of thanks for this unexpected late recognition of his work. Newspapers exposed the [[hoax]] the next day.  \n\nIn 1919, Brisset died, aged 81, at [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]].\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nThe ''Complete Works'' of Brisset were reprinted by Marc D\u00e9cimo, Dijon, Les Presses du r\u00e9el, 2001. In an essay entitled, ''Jean-Pierre Brisset, Prince des Penseurs, inventeur, grammairien et proph\u00e8te'', Dijon, Les presses du r\u00e9el, 2001, Marc D\u00e9cimo has given a biography, explanations about Brisset's delirium about frogs as ancestors of humankind.

In 2004 the ''Art of Swimming'' (as a frog) was published in paperback.\n\nAround 2001, [[Ernestine Chasseb\u0153uf]] wrote several letters to French politicians, universities, railway stations, library directors, psychiatric hospitals, to suggest they name a street, a university, etc. after Brisset.
