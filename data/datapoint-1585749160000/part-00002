But the axis of rotation can also move ([[axial precession]]), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession.

Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move ([[axial precession]]), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes.<ref name=Ward>{{cite journal|last1=William Ward|title=Large-Scale Variations in the Obliquity of Mars|journal=Science|volume=181|issue=4096|pages=260\u2013262|date=20 July 1973|doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.260|pmid=17730940|bibcode=1973Sci...181..260W}}</ref> The rate varies due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] and [[Planetary core|core]]-[[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, [[orbital resonance]]s may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar.<ref name=Ward/> [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its [[Moon#Formation|capture]], Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability.
