The chorus is also a play on [[Boogie Down Productions]]' anti-gun song \"[[Stop the Violence]]\", as well as \"Remix For P Is Free\" from their album [[Criminal Minded]]. \"[[Children's Story]]\" is a re-imagined version of [[Slick Rick]]'s original, which features Mos Def cautioning overly materialistic pursuits.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n\"Brown-Skin Lady\" is an affectionate tribute to brown-skinned women. The song encourages black and brown women to be proud of their hair and complexion, and to not be influenced by Western beauty standards. Kweli rhymes, \"We're not dealin' with the European standard of beauty tonight/Turn off the TV and put the magazine away/Look in the mirror tell me what you see/I see the evidence of divine presence.\"{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[File:Mos def-11-mika.jpg|thumb|Mos Def 1999]]\n\"Thieves in the Night\" was inspired by author [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[The Bluest Eye]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shields |first1=Michael |title=Twenty Years Later \u2014 Black Star\u2019s Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star |url=https://acrossthemargin.com/twenty-years-later-black-star/ |website=acrossthemargin.com |accessdate=7 March 2020 |date=27 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Temple |first1=Emily |title=11 Pop Songs for Literary People |url=https://lithub.com/11-pop-songs-for-literary-people/ |website=Literary Hub |accessdate=7 March 2020 |date=26 January 2018}}</ref> In the album's liner notes, Kweli explains that the paragraph \"struck me as one of the truest critiques of our society, and I read that in high school when I was 15 years old. I think it is especially true in the world of hip hop, because we get blinded by these illusions.\" The excerpt interpolated in the song is as follows: \"And fantasy it was, for we were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good but well-behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life.\" And the version on the track: \"Not strong, only aggressive/Not free, we only licensed/Not compassionate, only polite (now who the nicest?)/Not good but well-behaved/Chasin' after death so we could call ourselves brave, still livin' like mental slaves/Hiding like thieves in the night from life/Illusions of oasis making you look twice.\"{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Jason |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/black-star-mw0000043603 |title=Black Star \u2013 Black Star / Mos Def / Talib Kweli |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3Score = A\u2212<ref>{{cite journal |last=Diehl |first=Matt |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285374,00.html |title=Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are Black Star |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=October 23, 1998 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Muzik]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=McPhail |first=Pete |title=Blackstar: Blackstar (Rawkus) |journal=[[Muzik]] |issue=42 |location=London |date=November 1998 |page=83}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev5Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crysell |first=Andy |url=http://www.nme.com:80/reviews/reviews/19980919115701reviews.html |title=Blackstar \u2013 Blackstar |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=October 19, 1998 |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817222724/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980919115701reviews.html |archivedate=August 17, 2000 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Powell |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blackstar/albums/album/162843/review/5943898/black_star |title=Black Star: Black Star |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=October 7, 1998 |accessdate=April 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401202339/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blackstar/albums/album/162843/review/5943898/black_star |archivedate=April 1, 2008}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Mos Def |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRgtYCC6OUwC&pg=PA562 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |last=Relic |first=Peter |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/562 562] }}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[The Source]]''\n| rev8Score = 3.5/5<ref>{{cite journal |title=Black Star: Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star |journal=[[The Source]] |issue=110 |location=New York |date=November 1998 |page=198}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score = 10/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGaz0_gZPzIC&pg=PA80 |title=Mos Def |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=25 |issue=8 |location=New York |date=August 2009 |accessdate=April 9, 2016 |page=80}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"VV\">{{cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv1098-98.php |title=Consumer Guide |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |location=New York |date=November 3, 1998 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n''Black Star'' was voted the 24th best album of 1998 in the [[Pazz & Jop]], a poll of American critics nationwide published annually by ''[[The Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php |title=The 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |location=New York |date=March 2, 1999 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], the poll's creator, wrote in a contemporary review that Mos Def and Talib Kweli \"devise a hip hop imaginary where hater players lose their girls-not-bitches to MCs so disinterested they give 'em right back.
