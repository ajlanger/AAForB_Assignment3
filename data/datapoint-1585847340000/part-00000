{"title_page": "Charge of the Goddess", "text_new": "{{weasel|date=June 2014}}  The '''Charge of the Goddess''' (or '''Charge of the Star Goddess''') is an inspirational text often used in the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. The Charge of the Goddess is recited during most rituals in which the Wiccan priest/priestess is expected to represent, and/or embody, the [[Goddess]] within the sacred circle, and is often spoken by the High Priest/Priestess after the ritual of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].\n\nThe Charge is the promise of the Goddess (who is embodied by the high priestess) to all witches that she will teach and guide them.
