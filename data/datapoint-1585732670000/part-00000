During [[late antiquity]], the city rose to be [[Historical urban community sizes|the largest]] of the western world, with a population peaking at close to half a million people. Constantinople was the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], which ended with the [[fall of Constantinople|Muslim conquest]] in 1453.  Constantinople then became the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPopulation had declined during the medieval period, but as the Ottoman Empire approached its historical peak, the city grew to a population of close to 700,000 in the 16th century, once again ranking among the world's most populous cities. When the [[Republic of Turkey]] was founded in 1923, the capital was moved from Constantinople to [[Ankara]] (previously Angora). Since 1930, the native name \"Istanbul\" has been the sole official name of the city in Turkish and has since replaced the traditional name \"Constantinople\" in most western languages as well.\n\n== Prehistory==\nHumans have lived in the area now known as Istanbul since at least the [[Neolithic]] period.

Byzantium (now renamed as ''Nova Roma'' which eventually became ''Constantinopolis'', i.e. ''The City of Constantine'') was officially proclaimed the new capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.  At the end of his reign in 337, Constantine declared his three sons as joint heirs of the Roman Empire in a system of co-emperorship.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 248\">Hunt, Lynn.

The territory was officially split in 395 when [[Theodosius I]] (ruled, 379-395) died, leaving his son Honorius emperor of the western half, and his other son Arcadius emperor of the eastern half of the empire.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 248\"/>\n\nConstantinople became the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]]. The combination of [[empire|imperial]] power and a key location at the crossing point between the [[continent]]s of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and later [[Africa]] and others regions, played an important role in terms of [[commerce]], [[culture]], [[diplomacy]], and [[strategy]]. It was the center of the Greek world and, for most of the Byzantine period, the largest city in Europe. Constantine's conversion to [[Christianity]], in 312, had set the Roman Empire towards Christianization, and in 381, during the reign of Theodosius I, the official state religion of the Roman Empire became Christianity, turning Constantinople into a thriving religious center.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 253</ref>\n\nThroughout the fifth century, the western half of the [[Roman Empire]] lost most of its power through decline in political, economic and social situations, the last western emperor being deposed by Germanic mercenaries in AD 476; the eastern half, however, was flourishing. According to historians this flourishing Eastern Roman Empire was then classified as the Byzantine Empire to distinguish it from the Roman Empire.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 272</ref> This empire was distinctly Greek in culture, and became the centre of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]] after an earlier [[East-West Schism|split]] with Rome, and was adorned with many magnificent [[Church (building)|churches]], including [[Hagia Sophia]], once the world's largest [[cathedral]]. The seat of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], spiritual leader of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], remains. \n\nThe most famous Byzantine emperor was [[Justinian]] (527-565). During his reign he extended the Byzantine Empire to its largest boundaries spreading from Palestine to the tip of Spain. His other achievements include the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] church and the organized law system called the [[Codex]] which was completed in 534.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. pp. 273\u2013276</ref> However, Justinian's reign was the greatest influence of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nStarting in the 600's, warfare kept Constantinople's power flip-flopping between decline and progression. Alliance with Europe slowly began to break away from the Byzantine Empire between the seventh-eighth centuries, when the Byzantine and Roman churches disagreed on various subjects. However, the distinguishing gap placed between the two churches involved the use of icons in the church. Icons, being images of Christian holy people such as [[Jesus Christ]], the Virgin Mary and the saints, to Byzantine Christians were more than representations; they were believed to possess holy power that affected people's daily lives<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 291</ref> While many Byzantines worshiped icons many opposed the icons because they tested the authorities of the emperor. Finally in 726, Emperor Leo III (ruled, 717-741) ordered all icons to be destroyed. The destruction of icons reorganized and reoriented the Byzantine rulers in imperial power.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 292</ref> The fierce opposition to icons clashed with the pope's tolerance of images. The papacy was unwilling to permit sacred images and icons to be destroyed and this caused eventual separation.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. pp. 313\u2013314</ref> Their separation caused hatred between the two churches and cooperation between the two was a struggle.\n\nFrom around the 9th to 13th centuries, Constantinople developed complex relationships with an emerging and later the largest and most advanced state of that time in [[Europe]] - [[Kiev Rus]]. Constantinople played a significant role in the [[Kiev Rus]] development, culture, and politics. Many of the Kiev Princes were married to daughters of the Byzantine Emperors, and because of this connection Eastern Europe became Orthodox, after it was Christianized by [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kiev]]. However these relationships were not always friendly - Constantinople was sacked several times over those 400 years by Kiev Princes, forcing Constantinople to sign increasingly favorable treaties for [[Kiev]], the texts of which were preserved in the [[Primary Chronicle]] and other historical documents (see [[Rus'-Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'-Byzantine War]]s).  Byzantine constantly played Kiev, Poland, Bulgaria, and other European Nations of that time, against each other.\n\nNear 1204, Constantinople began to decline in power. Because of the failure of the Third Crusade, self-confident western Europeans decided to again try to capture the Holy City of Jerusalem in the [[Fourth Crusade]]; but this time their plan was to capture the Byzantine Empire as well. In 1204, western armies captured Constantinople and ransacked the city for treasures.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\">Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 427</ref> The pope decried the sacking of Constantinople but ordered the crusaders to consolidate their gains in the city for a year. The crusaders chose Baldwin of Flanders to be the new Byzantine Emperor; he along with other princes and the Venetians divided the Empire amongst themselves; they never made it to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> This new [[Latin Empire]] at Constantinople lasted until 1261, when the Byzantines under the command of [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] recaptured the city and some outlying territory.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> After this, Constantinople never regained its former glory. Rather than a thriving metropolis, Constantinople transformed into a collection of villages, and became a semi-[[ghost town]] with, as [[Ibn Battuta]] noted, sown fields within the city walls. The city by 1453 held less than a tenth of its former population.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\nThe city, known alternatively in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as ''\u1e32os\u1e6dan\u1e6d\u012bn\u012bye'' ({{lang|ota|\u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0647|rtl=yes}} after the Arabic form {{lang|ar-Latn|al-Qus\u1e6dan\u1e6d\u012bniyyah}} {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629|rtl=yes}}) or Istanbul (while its Christian minorities continued to name it Constantinople), was the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from its conquest in 1453 until the empire's collapse in 1922.\n\n===Conquest===\n{{further|Fall of Constantinople}}\n\n[[File:Melchior Lorck - The Prospect of Constantinople (section).jpg|thumb|[[Melchior Lorck]] - The Prospect of Constantinople (16th century)]]\nOn 29 May 1453, [[Sultan Mehmed II]] \"the Conqueror\", entered [[Constantinople]] after a 53\u2013day [[siege]] during which his cannon had torn a huge hole in the [[Walls of Constantinople|Walls of Theodosius II]]. The city became the third capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nMehmed had begun the siege on 6 April 1453. He had hired engineers to build [[cannons]] and bombs for the occasion. He also acquired scholars and imams to encourage the soldiers. In accordance with [[Shariah]] (Muslim Holy Law), Mehmed gave the Byzantine emperor Constantine Palaeologus (1449\u20131453) three chances to surrender the city.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/> He guaranteed the safety of the city's residents, with their riches, beliefs and honor. Constantine valiantly refused the offer.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2012-05-31). p. 6</ref>\nAfter more than a month of fighting, Mehmed's advisors were beginning to lose hope. Against their counsel, Mehmed continued to fight. The night before the final assault, he studied previous attempts to take the city to distinguish potentially successful approaches. On the morning of 29 May 1453 the sultan ordered  [[Adzan]] (the call to prayer).<ref name=\"Eversley, Lord 1914. p. 2\">Eversley, Lord. The Turkish Empire from 1288 to 1914. 3rd ed. Howard Fertig. New York: Howard Fertig Inc., 1924. p. 2</ref> This was not a regular prayer session for religious reasons but rather a scare tactic: the sight of the entire Ottoman army getting on their knees to pray provided an intimidating display of unity to the Byzantine forces designed to overcome their minds before their bodies.<ref name=\"Eversley, Lord 1914. p. 2\"/>\n\nOnce the fighting started, it went on for forty-eight days. The wall was beginning to collapse when Constantine sent a letter to the pope asking for help. In response the Papacy sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. The Ottoman ships burnt the Byzantine ones in a naval battle.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). p. 7</ref>\n\n<!-- {{wide image||1000px|Panoramic view of the [[Golden Horn]] in Istanbul, as seen from the [[Galata Tower]].

This tower could hold many soldiers who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). pp. 4\u201310</ref>\n\nFinally, Constantinople was under Ottoman rule. Mehmed entered Constantinople through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]]. He immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]] which he ordered to be sacked. He ordered that an [[imam]] meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: \"I testify that there is no God but [[Allah]]. I testify that Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.\"<ref>Lewis, Bernard. Istanbul and the Civilization if the Ottoman Empire. 1, University of Oklahoma Press, 1963. p. 6</ref> He turned the Orthodox cathedral into a Turkish [[mosque]], solidifying Turkish rule in Constantinople.\nMehmed ordered the city to be plundered for three days; during this time, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of casualties, rapes and forced deportations.<ref>Mansel, Philip (1995). Constantinople: City of the World's Desire. Hachette UK. p. 79. {{ISBN|0-7195-5076-9}}.</ref>\nFollowing the sack, Mehmed's main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city's defenses and re-population. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249</ref> Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be deported to Constantinople by September.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969 p. 236\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249. p. 236</ref>\n\n===Imperial capital===\nBy 1459, the Sultan dedicated a lot of energy to bringing prosperity to Constantinople. In several quarters of the city pious foundations were created; these areas consisted of a theological college, a school (or a Madrasa, usually connected to the mosque<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 330</ref>), a public kitchen, and a mosque.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/> In the same year Mehmed sent out orders that any Greeks who had left Constantinople as slaves or refugees should be allowed to return. These actions led it to become a once again thriving capital city, now of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/>\n\n[[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s reign over the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566 was a period of great artistic and architectural achievements. The famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] designed many mosques and other grand buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished. Many [[Zawiyya|tekkes]] survive to this day; some in the form of mosques while others have become museums such as the [[Jerrahi|Cerrahi]] Tekke and the [[S\u00fcnb\u00fcl Efendi]] and Ramazan Efendi mosques and [[t\u00fcrbe]]s in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihanesi in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Efendi tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi|Bekta\u015fi]] Tekke in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[cemevi]].\n\n{{wide image|Bosphorus Istanbul 2007.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of the historic peninsula of Istanbul, looking westwards from the southern entrance of the [[Bosporus|Bosporus Strait]] at the [[Sea of Marmara]].

For [[Mehmet II]], conquest was only the first stage; the second was giving the old city an entirely new cosmopolitan social structure. Most of what remained of the Byzantine population - a mere 30,000 persons - was deported. According to the Ashikpashazade, a Turkish chronicle,\n\n<blockquote>\nMehmet then sent officers to all his lands to announce that whoever wished should come and take possession in Constantinople, as freehold, of houses and orchards and gardens ... Despite this measure the city was not repopulated. So then the Sultan commanded that from every land families, rich and poor alike, should be brought in by force ... and now the city began to be populous.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Europe's Muslim Capital |last=Mansel |first=Philip |work=History Today |volume=53 |issue=6 |date=July 2003 |url= http://www.historytoday.com/philip-mansel/europes-muslim-capital }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 1.jpg|thumb|View of Constantinople, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]\nMehmet took much personal interest in the creation of his new capital. On his orders the great mosque and the college of Fatih were built on the old burial grounds of the Byzantine Emperors at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]]. Bit by bit the great Christian city was transformed into a great Muslim city. Even so, the city was not to be entirely Muslim, at least not until the late 20th century. [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Armenians]], all of whose diverse skills were needed, were allowed to settle in a city which was to become known as ''alem penah''-refuge of the universe. According to the census of 1477, there were 9,486 houses occupied by Muslims; 3,743 by Greeks; 1,647 by Jews; 267 by Christians from the Crimea, and 31 Gypsies. Mehmet also re-established Constantinople, as it was still called at that time, as the center of the Orthodox patriarchate. [[File:View of the Seraglio Point from Pera.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace|Seraglio Point]] from [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], with the [[Bosphorus]] at left, the entrance of the [[Golden Horn]] at right, and the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Princes' Islands]] on the horizon]]\n\nThere was also an Italian community in the area of the [[Galata Tower]]. Having surrendered before the fall of the city, Mehmet allowed them to preserve an element of self-government. For generations after, they supplied interpreters and diplomats for the Ottoman Court. After the conquest of Egypt in 1517, and the Sultan's acceptance of the position of Caliph, Constantinople acquired an additional importance in Muslim eyes. Mosques built by [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] and his successors gave the city the unique appearance it still preserves today. The individual communities, though, still lived in self-contained areas, and had little in the way of social interaction, a source of future trouble.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, living standards were at least equal to most of Europe.

The [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] (1455) and [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] (1459) were erected in the years following the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]ish conquest. Religious foundations were endowed to fund the building of mosques such as the [[Fatih Mosque|Fatih]] (1463) and their associated [[school]]s and [[public bath]]s. The city had to be repopulated by a mixture of force and encouragement.\n\n[[File:Istanbul by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|''Kostantiniyye'' from the \"Book of Navigation\" by  [[Piri Reis]], ca. 1525]]\n\nS\u00fcleyman's reign was a time of great [[artistic]] and [[architectural]] achievements. The architect Sinan designed many mosques and other great [[building]]s in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished.\n\n[[Sufi]] orders which were so widespread in the [[Islam]]ic world and who had many followers who had actively participated in the conquest of the city came to settle in the capital. During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times over 100 [[Zawiyya|Tekkes]] were active in the city alone. Many of these Tekkes survive to this day some in the form of mosques while others as museums such as the [[Jerrahi]] Tekke in [[Fatih]], the [[Sunbul Effendi]] and Ramazan Effendi [[Mosque]] and [[Turbes]] also in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihane in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Effendi Tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi]] Tekke in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[Cem Evi]].\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n\nAs the years passed the population increased, from about 80,000 at the death of Mehmet, to 300,000 by the 18th century, and 400,000 in 1800. The capital of an empire that stretched across Europe, Asia and Africa, it also became an important diplomatic centre, with several foreign embassies.  It was only after 1922, following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|war between Greece and Turkey]] that things really began to change. With the establishment of the new Turkish Republic, built on a wave of nationalism, there was a mass exodus of much of the Greek and Armenian population from Istanbul, which had ceased to be the capital. After [[Istanbul pogrom|riots in 1955]] the remaining fraction also departed.\n\nThe city was modernized from the 1870s onwards with the building of bridges, the creation of a proper water system, the use of electric lights, and the introduction of [[trams]] and [[telephones]].\n{{wide image|Constantinople-Photo-Panoramic view2.png|1000px|Panoramic view of the city in the 1870s as seen from [[Galata Tower]]}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Constantinople partie du cot\u00e9 de Stamboul - 4000006193.jpg|Stamboul, around 1896\nFile:(Street in Ey\u00fcp, a section of Constantinople, Turkey) (LOC) (4210466213).jpg|A street in Ey\u00fcp in 1890s\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldGalatasaray1.jpg|Old Galatasaray -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldBeyoglu.jpg|Beyo\u011flu (Pera) -->\nImage:Tophane Place Istanbul.jpg|Tophane in 1890s\n</gallery>\n\n== Republic of Turkey ==\n{{Main|Istanbul}}\n[[File:Ethno religious groups Istanbul.png|thumbnail|300px|Ethno-religious groups in Istanbul (1896-1965).

The international name ''Constantinople'' also remained in use until Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name in their languages and their postal service networks. In 1929 [[Lloyd's]] agents were informed that telegrams now must be addressed to \"Istanbul\" or \"Stamboul\", but ''[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]'' stated that mail could still be delivered to \"Constantinople\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Telegraphic Name For Constantinople.|work=[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]|date=1929-11-25|page=12|issue=45369}}</ref> However ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that year that mail to \"Constantinople\" may no longer be delivered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/15/archives/topics-of-the-times.html|title=Topics of the Times: The Passing of Constantinople|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1929-11-15|page=19}}</ref> In 1929 Turkish Nationalists advocated for the usage of Istanbul in English instead of Constantinople.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"ISTANBUL\": The Correct Way of Writing Constantinople|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-15|page=11}}, also mentioned in {{cite news|title=MISCELLANY: The Name-Changers|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-16|page=11}}</ref> The [[U.S. State Department]] began using \"Istanbul\" in May 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/05/28/archives/washington-accepts-istanbul-as-replacing-constantinople.html|title=Washington Accepts \"Istanbul\" As Replacing \"Constantinople\"|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1930-05-28|accessdate=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the republic, Istanbul was overlooked in favour of Ankara, the new capital. However, starting from the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares (such as [[Taksim Square]]), boulevards and avenues were constructed throughout the city; sometimes at the expense of the demolition of many historical buildings.\n\nIn September 1955, many [[ethnic Greek]] businesses were destroyed during the [[Istanbul pogrom]]. This accelerated the departure of Greeks from the city and from Turkey. Jews, Armenians, and [[Georgian people|Georgian]]s were also targeted.\n\nStarting from the 1970s, the population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase, as people from [[Anatolia]] migrated to the city in order to find employment in the many new factories that were constructed at the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing development, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the greater metropolitan area of Istanbul.\n\nIn 2013, [[Taksim Square]] was the center of the [[Gezi Park protests]], where protesters protested a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkey's secularism]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of Istanbul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{sisterlinks|Istanbul}}\n* Boyar, Ebru; Fleet, Kate.

Constantinople was the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], which ended with the [[fall of Constantinople|Muslim conquest]] in 1453.  Constantinople then became the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPopulation had declined during the medieval period, but as the Ottoman Empire approached its historical peak, the city grew to a population of close to 700,000 in the 16th century, once again ranking among the world's most populous cities.

Byzantium (now renamed as ''Nova Roma'' which eventually became ''Constantinopolis'', i.e. ''The City of Constantine'') was officially proclaimed the new capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.  At the end of his reign in 337, Constantine declared his three sons as joint heirs of the Roman Empire in a system of co-emperorship.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 248\">Hunt, Lynn.

The territory was officially split in 395 when [[Theodosius I]] (ruled, 379-395) died, leaving his son Honorius emperor of the western half, and his other son Arcadius emperor of the eastern half of the empire.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 248\"/>\n\nConstantinople became the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]]. The combination of [[empire|imperial]] power and a key location at the crossing point between the [[continent]]s of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and later [[Africa]] and others regions, played an important role in terms of [[commerce]], [[culture]], [[diplomacy]], and [[strategy]]. It was the center of the Greek world and, for most of the Byzantine period, the largest city in Europe. Constantine's conversion to [[Christianity]], in 312, had set the Roman Empire towards Christianization, and in 381, during the reign of Theodosius I, the official state religion of the Roman Empire became Christianity, turning Constantinople into a thriving religious center.<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

According to historians this flourishing Eastern Roman Empire was then classified as the Byzantine Empire to distinguish it from the Roman Empire.<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 272</ref> This empire was distinctly Greek in culture, and became the centre of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]] after an earlier [[East-West Schism|split]] with Rome, and was adorned with many magnificent [[Church (building)|churches]], including [[Hagia Sophia]], once the world's largest [[cathedral]]. The seat of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], spiritual leader of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], remains. \n\nThe most famous Byzantine emperor was [[Justinian]] (527-565). During his reign he extended the Byzantine Empire to its largest boundaries spreading from Palestine to the tip of Spain. His other achievements include the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] church and the organized law system called the [[Codex]] which was completed in 534.<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

Alliance with Europe slowly began to break away from the Byzantine Empire between the seventh-eighth centuries, when the Byzantine and Roman churches disagreed on various subjects. However, the distinguishing gap placed between the two churches involved the use of icons in the church. Icons, being images of Christian holy people such as [[Jesus Christ]], the Virgin Mary and the saints, to Byzantine Christians were more than representations; they were believed to possess holy power that affected people's daily lives<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 291</ref> While many Byzantines worshiped icons many opposed the icons because they tested the authorities of the emperor. Finally in 726, Emperor Leo III (ruled, 717-741) ordered all icons to be destroyed. The destruction of icons reorganized and reoriented the Byzantine rulers in imperial power.<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 292</ref> The fierce opposition to icons clashed with the pope's tolerance of images. The papacy was unwilling to permit sacred images and icons to be destroyed and this caused eventual separation.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra.

Constantinople played a significant role in the [[Kiev Rus]] development, culture, and politics. Many of the Kiev Princes were married to daughters of the Byzantine Emperors, and because of this connection Eastern Europe became Orthodox, after it was Christianized by [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kiev]]. However these relationships were not always friendly - Constantinople was sacked several times over those 400 years by Kiev Princes, forcing Constantinople to sign increasingly favorable treaties for [[Kiev]], the texts of which were preserved in the [[Primary Chronicle]] and other historical documents (see [[Rus'-Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'-Byzantine War]]s).  Byzantine constantly played Kiev, Poland, Bulgaria, and other European Nations of that time, against each other.\n\nNear 1204, Constantinople began to decline in power. Because of the failure of the Third Crusade, self-confident western Europeans decided to again try to capture the Holy City of Jerusalem in the [[Fourth Crusade]]; but this time their plan was to capture the Byzantine Empire as well. In 1204, western armies captured Constantinople and ransacked the city for treasures.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\">Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed.

The crusaders chose Baldwin of Flanders to be the new Byzantine Emperor; he along with other princes and the Venetians divided the Empire amongst themselves; they never made it to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> This new [[Latin Empire]] at Constantinople lasted until 1261, when the Byzantines under the command of [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] recaptured the city and some outlying territory.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> After this, Constantinople never regained its former glory. Rather than a thriving metropolis, Constantinople transformed into a collection of villages, and became a semi-[[ghost town]] with, as [[Ibn Battuta]] noted, sown fields within the city walls.

On the morning of 29 May 1453 the sultan ordered  [[Adzan]] (the call to prayer).<ref name=\"Eversley, Lord 1914. p. 2\">Eversley, Lord. The Turkish Empire from 1288 to 1914. 3rd ed. Howard Fertig.

The wall was beginning to collapse when Constantine sent a letter to the pope asking for help. In response the Papacy sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. The Ottoman ships burnt the Byzantine ones in a naval battle.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). p. 7</ref>\n\n<!-- {{wide image||1000px|Panoramic view of the [[Golden Horn]] in Istanbul, as seen from the [[Galata Tower]].

This tower could hold many soldiers who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). pp. 4\u201310</ref>\n\nFinally, Constantinople was under Ottoman rule. Mehmed entered Constantinople through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]]. He immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]] which he ordered to be sacked. He ordered that an [[imam]] meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: \"I testify that there is no God but [[Allah]]. I testify that Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.\"<ref>Lewis, Bernard. Istanbul and the Civilization if the Ottoman Empire. 1, University of Oklahoma Press, 1963. p. 6</ref> He turned the Orthodox cathedral into a Turkish [[mosque]], solidifying Turkish rule in Constantinople.\nMehmed ordered the city to be plundered for three days; during this time, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of casualties, rapes and forced deportations.<ref>Mansel, Philip (1995).

Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249</ref> Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be deported to Constantinople by September.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969 p. 236\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249. p. 236</ref>\n\n===Imperial capital===\nBy 1459, the Sultan dedicated a lot of energy to bringing prosperity to Constantinople. In several quarters of the city pious foundations were created; these areas consisted of a theological college, a school (or a Madrasa, usually connected to the mosque<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

These actions led it to become a once again thriving capital city, now of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/>\n\n[[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s reign over the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566 was a period of great artistic and architectural achievements. The famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] designed many mosques and other grand buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished. Many [[Zawiyya|tekkes]] survive to this day; some in the form of mosques while others have become museums such as the [[Jerrahi|Cerrahi]] Tekke and the [[S\u00fcnb\u00fcl Efendi]] and Ramazan Efendi mosques and [[t\u00fcrbe]]s in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihanesi in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Efendi tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi|Bekta\u015fi]] Tekke in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[cemevi]].\n\n{{wide image|Bosphorus Istanbul 2007.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of the historic peninsula of Istanbul, looking westwards from the southern entrance of the [[Bosporus|Bosporus Strait]] at the [[Sea of Marmara]].

For [[Mehmet II]], conquest was only the first stage; the second was giving the old city an entirely new cosmopolitan social structure. Most of what remained of the Byzantine population - a mere 30,000 persons - was deported. According to the Ashikpashazade, a Turkish chronicle,\n\n<blockquote>\nMehmet then sent officers to all his lands to announce that whoever wished should come and take possession in Constantinople, as freehold, of houses and orchards and gardens ... Despite this measure the city was not repopulated. So then the Sultan commanded that from every land families, rich and poor alike, should be brought in by force ... and now the city began to be populous.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Europe's Muslim Capital |last=Mansel |first=Philip |work=History Today |volume=53 |issue=6 |date=July 2003 |url= http://www.historytoday.com/philip-mansel/europes-muslim-capital }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 1.jpg|thumb|View of Constantinople, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]\nMehmet took much personal interest in the creation of his new capital. On his orders the great mosque and the college of Fatih were built on the old burial grounds of the Byzantine Emperors at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]]. Bit by bit the great Christian city was transformed into a great Muslim city. Even so, the city was not to be entirely Muslim, at least not until the late 20th century. [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Armenians]], all of whose diverse skills were needed, were allowed to settle in a city which was to become known as ''alem penah''-refuge of the universe. According to the census of 1477, there were 9,486 houses occupied by Muslims; 3,743 by Greeks; 1,647 by Jews; 267 by Christians from the Crimea, and 31 Gypsies. Mehmet also re-established Constantinople, as it was still called at that time, as the center of the Orthodox patriarchate. [[File:View of the Seraglio Point from Pera.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace|Seraglio Point]] from [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], with the [[Bosphorus]] at left, the entrance of the [[Golden Horn]] at right, and the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Princes' Islands]] on the horizon]]\n\nThere was also an Italian community in the area of the [[Galata Tower]]. Having surrendered before the fall of the city, Mehmet allowed them to preserve an element of self-government. For generations after, they supplied interpreters and diplomats for the Ottoman Court. After the conquest of Egypt in 1517, and the Sultan's acceptance of the position of Caliph, Constantinople acquired an additional importance in Muslim eyes. Mosques built by [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] and his successors gave the city the unique appearance it still preserves today. The individual communities, though, still lived in self-contained areas, and had little in the way of social interaction, a source of future trouble.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, living standards were at least equal to most of Europe. For example, the development of urban craftsmen's wages was on a level similar to southern and central Europe during the sixteenth to eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] (1455) and [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] (1459) were erected in the years following the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]ish conquest. Religious foundations were endowed to fund the building of mosques such as the [[Fatih Mosque|Fatih]] (1463) and their associated [[school]]s and [[public bath]]s. The city had to be repopulated by a mixture of force and encouragement.\n\n[[File:Istanbul by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|''Kostantiniyye'' from the \"Book of Navigation\" by  [[Piri Reis]], ca. 1525]]\n\nS\u00fcleyman's reign was a time of great [[artistic]] and [[architectural]] achievements. The architect Sinan designed many mosques and other great [[building]]s in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished.\n\n[[Sufi]] orders which were so widespread in the [[Islam]]ic world and who had many followers who had actively participated in the conquest of the city came to settle in the capital. During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times over 100 [[Zawiyya|Tekkes]] were active in the city alone. Many of these Tekkes survive to this day some in the form of mosques while others as museums such as the [[Jerrahi]] Tekke in [[Fatih]], the [[Sunbul Effendi]] and Ramazan Effendi [[Mosque]] and [[Turbes]] also in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihane in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Effendi Tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi]] Tekke in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[Cem Evi]].\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n\nAs the years passed the population increased, from about 80,000 at the death of Mehmet, to 300,000 by the 18th century, and 400,000 in 1800. The capital of an empire that stretched across Europe, Asia and Africa, it also became an important diplomatic centre, with several foreign embassies.  It was only after 1922, following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|war between Greece and Turkey]] that things really began to change. With the establishment of the new Turkish Republic, built on a wave of nationalism, there was a mass exodus of much of the Greek and Armenian population from Istanbul, which had ceased to be the capital. After [[Istanbul pogrom|riots in 1955]] the remaining fraction also departed.\n\nThe city was modernized from the 1870s onwards with the building of bridges, the creation of a proper water system, the use of electric lights, and the introduction of [[trams]] and [[telephones]].\n{{wide image|Constantinople-Photo-Panoramic view2.png|1000px|Panoramic view of the city in the 1870s as seen from [[Galata Tower]]}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Constantinople partie du cot\u00e9 de Stamboul - 4000006193.jpg|Stamboul, around 1896\nFile:(Street in Ey\u00fcp, a section of Constantinople, Turkey) (LOC) (4210466213).jpg|A street in Ey\u00fcp in 1890s\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldGalatasaray1.jpg|Old Galatasaray -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldBeyoglu.jpg|Beyo\u011flu (Pera) -->\nImage:Tophane Place Istanbul.jpg|Tophane in 1890s\n</gallery>\n\n== Republic of Turkey ==\n{{Main|Istanbul}}\n[[File:Ethno religious groups Istanbul.png|thumbnail|300px|Ethno-religious groups in Istanbul (1896-1965).

On 13 November 1918, the [[Occupation of Constantinople]] by Allied forces began, ending on 4 October 1923.<ref>{{cite book|author1= Stephen  Pope |author2=Elizabeth-Anne Wheal|title=Dictionary of the First World War|year= 1995 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-85052-979-1 |chapter=Select Chronology |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=fOrNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA523 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Republic of Turkey]] was founded under [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] on 29 October 1923, the capital was moved from [[Istanbul]] to [[Ankara]].\nAs a consequence, population collapsed, from an estimated 1,125,000 in 1914 to about 500,000 in 1924; but population steadily grew during the later 20th century, the metropolitan population surpassing 10 million in the year 2000.\n\nThe city's name ''\u0130stanbul'' is a shortened version with a Turkish character of the Medieval Greek phrase \"\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\" [is tin \u02c8polin], meaning \"into the city\", which had long been in vernacular use by the local population. The international name ''Constantinople'' also remained in use until Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name in their languages and their postal service networks. In 1929 [[Lloyd's]] agents were informed that telegrams now must be addressed to \"Istanbul\" or \"Stamboul\", but ''[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]'' stated that mail could still be delivered to \"Constantinople\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Telegraphic Name For Constantinople.|work=[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]|date=1929-11-25|page=12|issue=45369}}</ref> However ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that year that mail to \"Constantinople\" may no longer be delivered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/15/archives/topics-of-the-times.html|title=Topics of the Times: The Passing of Constantinople|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1929-11-15|page=19}}</ref> In 1929 Turkish Nationalists advocated for the usage of Istanbul in English instead of Constantinople.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"ISTANBUL\": The Correct Way of Writing Constantinople|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-15|page=11}}, also mentioned in {{cite news|title=MISCELLANY: The Name-Changers|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-16|page=11}}</ref> The [[U.S. State Department]] began using \"Istanbul\" in May 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/05/28/archives/washington-accepts-istanbul-as-replacing-constantinople.html|title=Washington Accepts \"Istanbul\" As Replacing \"Constantinople\"|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1930-05-28|accessdate=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the republic, Istanbul was overlooked in favour of Ankara, the new capital. However, starting from the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares (such as [[Taksim Square]]), boulevards and avenues were constructed throughout the city; sometimes at the expense of the demolition of many historical buildings.\n\nIn September 1955, many [[ethnic Greek]] businesses were destroyed during the [[Istanbul pogrom]]. This accelerated the departure of Greeks from the city and from Turkey. Jews, Armenians, and [[Georgian people|Georgian]]s were also targeted.\n\nStarting from the 1970s, the population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase, as people from [[Anatolia]] migrated to the city in order to find employment in the many new factories that were constructed at the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing development, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the greater metropolitan area of Istanbul.\n\nIn 2013, [[Taksim Square]] was the center of the [[Gezi Park protests]], where protesters protested a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkey's secularism]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of Istanbul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{sisterlinks|Istanbul}}\n* Boyar, Ebru; Fleet, Kate.
