Preclinical usage of epigenetic agents like [[5-azacytidine]] ([[DNMT]] inhibitor) and [[romidepsin]] (HDAC inhibitor) sensitizes cancer cells for further treatment. Some examples of clinical trials performed are listed below. \n\n==== Colorectal cancer ====\n\nEpigenetic treatment with [[5-azacytidine]] (5-AZA) and [[romidepsin]] before [[pembrolizumab]] administration was tested for safety in a [[clinical trial]] from 2016 - 2018. Drug administration ([[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]], [[romidepsin]], [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] + [[romidepsin]]) was followed for 14 days in 24 patients between 40\u201369 years old. Side effects in groups included [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and [[fatigue]]. Moreover, [[lack of appetite]], [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] were independent of the drug combination received by the patient. After this study, epigenetic agent 'pretherapy' with [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] and [[romidepsin]] followed by [[pembrolizumab]] treatment was deemed feasible and overall safe for patients.<ref>Murphy, A. G., Walker, R., Lutz, E. R., Parkinson, R., Ahuja, N., Zheng, L., ... & Azad, N. S. (2019). Epigenetic priming prior to [[pembrolizumab]] in [[mismatch repair]]-proficient advanced [[colorectal cancer]]</ref>\n\n==== Gastric carcinomas ====\nGastric cancer is heavily influenced by epigenetic aberrations. Analysis showed that DNA methylation changes have a higher influence on gastric cancer than point mutations. A phase I study on [[gastric cancer]] 5-AZA pretreatment in combination with [[epirubicin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[capecitabine]] was successful.<ref>Schneider, B. J., Shah, M. A., Klute, K., Ocean, A., Popa, E., Altorki, N., ... & Palmer, R. (2017).

Patients were treated two weeks before the immunotherapy either with 1 hour infusion (group A) or continuous infusion for 3, or 7 days (group B). Group B showed higher levels of hypomethylation after treatment than group A, but neither showed toxicity by the epigenetic agent. Finally, no significant side effects were encountered.<ref>Scandura, J. M., Roboz, G. J., Moh, M., Morawa, E., Brenet, F., Bose, J. R., ... & Curcio, T. J. (2011).

Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology, 118(6), 1472-1480.</ref>\n\nOlder patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]] diagnosis have poor [[prognosis]], lower rates of [[complete remission]] and worsening of overall survival. A phase 2 study was performed evaluating the efficacy and safety of epigenetic priming through [[decitabine]] in elderly patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]]. In 2015, 46 patients who were not candidates for intensive [[chemotherapy]] enrolled in the study. Treatment consisted of continuous [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] administration of [[decitabine]], followed by 5 days of [[cytarabine]] [[immunotherapy]]. Patients continued with a second cycle, if evidence of disease was found on 15 day [[bone marrow biopsy]], otherwise they proceeded with [[decitabine]] maintenance. The study showed that pretreatment with [[decitabine]] followed by [[cytarabine]] promoted higher number of [[complete remission]]s (70%) in older patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]].<ref>Im, A., Agha, M., Raptis, A., Hou, J. Z., Farah, R., Lim, S. H., ... & Fukas, L. (2015).

This idea is supported by various pieces of evidence. Firstly, despite [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] during [[Memory|memory formation]], memories may be retrieved later on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=T.

Preclinical usage of epigenetic agents like [[5-azacytidine]] ([[DNMT]] inhibitor) and [[romidepsin]] (HDAC inhibitor) sensitizes cancer cells for further treatment. Some examples of clinical trials performed are listed below. \n\n==== Colorectal cancer ====\n\nEpigenetic treatment with [[5-azacytidine]] (5-AZA) and [[romidepsin]] before [[pembrolizumab]] administration was tested for safety in a [[clinical trial]] from 2016 - 2018. Drug administration ([[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]], [[romidepsin]], [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] + [[romidepsin]]) was followed for 14 days in 24 patients between 40\u201369 years old. Side effects in groups included [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and [[fatigue]]. Moreover, [[lack of appetite]], [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] were independent of the drug combination received by the patient. After this study, epigenetic agent 'pretherapy' with [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] and [[romidepsin]] followed by [[pembrolizumab]] treatment was deemed feasible and overall safe for patients.<ref>Murphy, A. G., Walker, R., Lutz, E. R., Parkinson, R., Ahuja, N., Zheng, L., ... & Azad, N. S. (2019). Epigenetic priming prior to [[pembrolizumab]] in [[mismatch repair]]-proficient advanced [[colorectal cancer]]</ref>\n\n==== Gastric carcinomas ====\nGastric cancer is heavily influenced by epigenetic aberrations. Analysis showed that DNA methylation changes have a higher influence on gastric cancer than point mutations. A phase I study on [[gastric cancer]] 5-AZA pretreatment in combination with [[epirubicin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[capecitabine]] was successful.<ref>Schneider, B. J., Shah, M.

Patients were treated two weeks before the immunotherapy either with 1 hour infusion (group A) or continuous infusion for 3, or 7 days (group B). Group B showed higher levels of hypomethylation after treatment than group A, but neither showed toxicity by the epigenetic agent. Finally, no significant side effects were encountered.<ref>Scandura, J. M., Roboz, G. J., Moh, M., Morawa, E., Brenet, F., Bose, J. R., ... & Curcio, T. J. (2011). Phase 1 study of epigenetic priming with decitabine prior to standard induction chemotherapy for patients with AML. Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology, 118(6), 1472-1480.</ref>\n\nOlder patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]] diagnosis have poor [[prognosis]], lower rates of [[complete remission]] and worsening of overall survival. A phase 2 study was performed evaluating the efficacy and safety of epigenetic priming through [[decitabine]] in elderly patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]]. In 2015, 46 patients who were not candidates for intensive [[chemotherapy]] enrolled in the study. Treatment consisted of continuous [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] administration of [[decitabine]], followed by 5 days of [[cytarabine]] [[immunotherapy]]. Patients continued with a second cycle, if evidence of disease was found on 15 day [[bone marrow biopsy]], otherwise they proceeded with [[decitabine]] maintenance. The study showed that pretreatment with [[decitabine]] followed by [[cytarabine]] promoted higher number of [[complete remission]]s (70%) in older patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]].<ref>Im, A., Agha, M., Raptis, A., Hou, J. Z., Farah, R., Lim, S. H., ... & Fukas, L. (2015).

This idea is supported by various pieces of evidence. Firstly, despite [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] during [[Memory|memory formation]], memories may be retrieved later on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=T.

Thus, although the mechanisms that [[Chromatin remodeling|loosen chromatin]] are unspecific in their target, likely have specificity depending on which ones are activated. In a similar vein, it is believed that the action of different of priming agents, such as the varieties of histone acetyltransferases, may combine to create a stacking effect on neuron chromatin, resulting in significantly increased expression of the associated genes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Metabolic syndrome ==\n\nEpidemiological and experimental studies have shown that [[environmental factor]]s during early development, such as maternal nutrition and body composition, can influence the metabolic phenotype of the offspring.<ref name=\"Epigenetic priming of the metabolic\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruce |first1=KD |last2=Cagampang |first2=FR |title=Epigenetic priming of the metabolic syndrome. |journal=Toxicology Mechanisms and Methods |date=May 2011 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=353\u201361 |doi=10.3109/15376516.2011.559370 |pmid=21495873}}</ref> Epigenetic priming is thought to mediate the persistent changes in [[gene expression]] that could eventually lead to [[metabolic syndrome]].
