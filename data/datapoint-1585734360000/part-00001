In their book ''Rod Serling's Night Gallery: An After-Hours Tour'', authors Scott Skelton and Jim Benson identify 39 of the 98 individual segments that were produced for ''Night Gallery'' as being \"severely altered\" in syndication. Twenty-five episodes of an unrelated, short-lived supernatural series from 1972, ''[[The Sixth Sense (TV series)|The Sixth Sense]]'', were also incorporated into the syndicated version of the series, with Serling providing newly filmed introductions to those episodes. As ''The Sixth Sense'' was originally a one-hour show, these episodes were all severely edited to fit into the half-hour timeslot.\n\nThe original, uncut and un-edited hour-long  version of the series (and without the additional ''Sixth Sense'' episodes) has been shown on [[STARZ!]]\u2019s [[Encore (TV network)|Encore Mystery]] premium movie cable network.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The show has aired in the 30-minute format in some markets through the [[Retro Television Network]] in the past.\n\n[[MeTV]] currently has broadcast rights for ''Night Gallery'' and airs the show in its edited, 30-minute format, including the edited ''The Sixth Sense'' episodes.\n\nFrom May 21 to May 23, 2016, [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] aired a marathon of the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decades TV Network|url=http://www.decades.com/view/2016-05-21#today-heading-top|accessdate=21 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521232341/http://www.decades.com/view/2016-05-21#today-heading-top|archivedate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn December 6, 2018, [[Syfy]] announced that it plans to revive the ''Night Gallery'' series.\n\nOn April 6, 2020, [[Comet TV]] will begin airing the show.\n\n==Home media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] has released all 3 seasons on DVD in Region 1 as well as the first season on DVD in the UK.\n\nOn September 12, 2017, Universal released ''Night Gallery: The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Night-Gallery-The-Complete-Series/23423|title=Night Gallery DVD news: Announcement for The Complete Series - TVShowsOnDVD.com|website=www.tvshowsondvd.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102195108/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Night-Gallery-The-Complete-Series/23423|archivedate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n!DVD name\n!Episodes\n!Release date\n!Additional information\n|-\n| The Complete First Season\n| align=\"center\"|17\n| August 24, 2004\n| Includes pilot film\n|-\n| Season 2\n| align=\"center\"|61\n| November 11, 2008\n|\n* Podcast commentaries, featuring Jim Benson and Scott Skelton\n* Audio commentaries, with Guillermo del Toro\n* Revisiting the Gallery: A Look Back\n* Art Gallery: The Paintings in \"Rod Serling's ''Night Gallery''\"\n* NBC TV Promos\n|-\n| Season 3\n| align=\"center\"|20\n| April 10, 2012\n|-\n| The Complete Series\n| align=\"center\"|98\n| September 12, 2017\n|\n|}\n\n==See also==\n'''Similar series'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond]]''\n* ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''\n* ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''\n* ''[[Darkroom (TV series)|Darkroom]]''\n* ''[[Fear Itself (TV series)|Fear Itself]]''\n* ''[[Masters of Horror]]''\n* ''[[Masters of Science Fiction]]''\n* ''[[Monsters (TV series)|Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Night Visions (TV series)|Night Visions]]''\n* ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]''\n* ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]''\n* ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]''\n* ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]''\n* ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''\n* ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]''\n* ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''\n* [[The Twilight Zone (franchise)|''Twilight Zone'' franchise]]\n* ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]''\n* ''[[Way Out (TV series)|Way Out]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0065327}}\n* {{tv.com show|night-gallery|Night Gallery}}\n* [http://www.nightgallery.net/ Rod Serling's ''Night Gallery'': A Shadowy Museum of the Outre]\n\n{{Twilight Zone}}\n\n[[Category:1970 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1973 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s American anthology television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:American horror fiction television series]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Rod Serling]]\n[[Category:American fantasy drama television series]]\n[[Category:American mystery television series]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama television series]]\n[[Category:American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American thriller television series]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFormat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Gallery"}
