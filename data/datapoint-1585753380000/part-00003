It was founded in the 12th century in the most northerly of the three settlements in Lancing parish, which has Saxon origins.  The present building is mostly 13th-century in appearance, and structural work has been carried out several times since\u2014particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the church was restored from a ruinous condition.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Lancing'' suggests [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] influence (the ''-ing'' suffix implied, in Saxon terms, a temporary settlement),<ref name=\"Hare6\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=6.}}</ref> and remains dating from the 6th century have been found nearby.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] in 1086, the [[Lord of the Manor]] of nearby [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]], Robert le Savage, held the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Lancing.  The land in the parish, which extended from the [[South Downs]] to the [[English Channel]] coast, was chiefly agricultural.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>\n\nAround this time, the large manor was divided into several smaller ones, of which North Lancing and South Lancing (as they became known) were the most important.<ref name=\"Jones5\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=5.}}</ref>  Gradually, three settlements developed: North Lancing, closest to the Downs; South Lancing, near the coast; and the nearby Pende (now vanished), on the coast and briefly a successful port.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  No church existed in the area at that time, but one was established in North Lancing in the 12th century:<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/> a date of around 1120 has been suggested from analysis of surviving masonry at the ends of the [[chancel]].<ref name=\"Jones5\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner255\">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=255.}}</ref>  In about 1180,<ref name=\"Jones5\"/><ref name=\"Wales134\">{{Harvnb|Wales|1999|p=134.}}</ref> an arched doorway, now forming part of the porch on the south side, was added.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>\n\nThe whole structure was rebuilt between about 1280 and 1300, giving the church its present layout.<ref name=\"Jones5\"/><ref name=\"Wales134\"/>  It presents a consistent and harmonious architectural impression, despite the long period of time needed to complete the work.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>  A stair turret leading up to the tower was built in the 15th century; part of the north aisle had to be blocked to accommodate this.<ref name=\"Coppin105\">{{Harvnb|Coppin|206|p=105.}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century\u2014especially after the [[English Restoration|Restoration of 1660]]\u2014Anglican religious worship declined and many churches in England fell into disrepair.<ref name=\"Hare28\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=28.}}</ref>  This attitude was common among the people of Sussex, where church attendances declined dramatically in many villages, including North Lancing.<ref name=\"Hare28\"/><ref name=\"Hare29\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=29.}}</ref>  The first sign of structural decay at St James the Less Church came in 1618, when the upper part of the tower collapsed.<ref name=\"Jones6\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=6.}}</ref>  By 1621 it had been repaired by cutting it down in size and topping it with a \"Sussex cap\"-style roof.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The rest of the building quickly fell into ruins, however: birds were found to be nesting inside,<ref name=\"Hare29\"/> pigeons bred there and the [[Baptismal font|font]] was empty.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  By 1662, the church could no longer be used.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>\n\nThe situation improved in the late 18th century, when some restoration work was carried out.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  More substantial rebuilding in 1827 added extra pews and altered several windows.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones6\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=256.}}</ref>  The most recent addition was a [[vestry]] in 1934.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Wales134\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe church is built of [[flint]] [[cobblestone]]s.  Areas of [[Roughcast|pebbledashing]] remain,<ref name=\"IoE297263\"/> although some was removed in the mid-20th century.<ref name=\"Jones7\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=7.}}</ref>  [[Ashlar]] has been used as well.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  Architecturally, the timing and completeness of the late 13th-century rebuilding has resulted in the church presenting an unusually complete example of the transition from the [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English Gothic style]] to the [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic style]].<ref name=\"Jones6\"/>\n\nThe church has, from west to east, a three-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] [[nave]] with aisles on the north and south sides, a short tower and a [[chancel]] with a lower roofline than the nave.  There is a porch with an entrance doorway on the south side, another door at the west end and a vestry at the northeast corner as well.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones6\"/>\n\nUntil its collapse in 1618, the tower was much taller and ended in a [[parapet]].  The reconstruction shortened it (making the upper windows smaller) and added a Sussex cap\u2014a shallow pyramid-shaped [[slate]] roof common in Sussex.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The date was commemorated by an inscription on the north wall.<ref name=\"IoE297263\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The church's original entrance doorway has been retained in the south porch: it has a round arch carried on [[chamfer]]ed shafts with [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The detail on the stonework, although characteristic of the Norman period, is more intricate than usual.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The arch has a [[hood mould]], which sits clear of the [[Abacus (architecture)|abaci]] at the top of the shafts.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Inside the doorway is an ancient [[Holy water font|stoup]] for [[holy water]], which is now in poor condition.<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Jones11\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=11.}}</ref>  The other doorway, in the west face, is similar to its south-face counterpart, but is more likely to be 15th-century than 12th-century.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  [[Buttress]]es seem to have been added around the tower at some point during the 17th century,<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/> and a large buttress remains on the south side of the chancel.  This was thought to be hollow until it was analysed properly in 1948 when pebbledashing was removed from the exterior.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>\n\nMost of the windows are either one- or two-light [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]], although some later examples are in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic style]].<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Some of the chancel windows are larger, with three lights.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>  [[Stained glass]], by an unknown designer, was installed in three windows in 1866.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInside the church, remnants of the original Norman building can be seen at opposite ends: in the west wall of the nave and the east end of the chancel.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The chancel, nave and aisles were rebuilt (to the same dimensions as the original building) when English Gothic architecture was at its height, and the [[chamfer]]ed arches, octagonal pillars, chancel arch, blind arches and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] are considered good examples of their kind.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=9.}}</ref>  The [[king post]] roof of the nave has also been praised.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInterior fittings include a 14th-century [[Easter sepulchre]] with an [[ogee]]-arched roof,<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> part of a [[sedilia]], some Norman [[frieze]]work,<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> and a 12th-century square [[Baptismal font|font]] in good condition.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/>\n\n==Today==\nSt James the Less Church was [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade I by [[English Heritage]] on 12 October 1954.<ref name=\"IoE297263\">{{NHLE|num=1192533|desc= The Parish Church of St James, Manor Road, Lancing, Adur, West Sussex|year=2007|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  Such buildings are defined as being of \"exceptional interest\" and greater than national importance.<ref name=\"EH2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |title=Listed Buildings |year=2010 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DEarkz4v?url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |archive-date=27 December 2012 |df= }}</ref>  As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and [[Listed buildings in Adur|119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district]].<ref name=\"IoEStats-WSx\">{{Cite web|title=Images of England \u2014 Statistics by County (West Sussex) |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |work=[[Images of England]] |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |year=2007 |access-date=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DNVqdtdK?url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |archive-date=2 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe style of worship in the church is Traditional Catholic.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/|title=St James the Less, Lancing|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  [[Holy Communion|Eucharistic]] services take place every Wednesday and Sunday: there are evening prayer services everyday, and Family Eucharist on the third Sunday each month.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames-Services\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/page/2593/|title=Services|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/135 parish], in its present form, covers {{convert|2236|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"VCH18216\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt1/pp34-53|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1 \u2013 Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

This was thought to be hollow until it was analysed properly in 1948 when pebbledashing was removed from the exterior.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>\n\nMost of the windows are either one- or two-light [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]], although some later examples are in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic style]].<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Some of the chancel windows are larger, with three lights.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>  [[Stained glass]], by an unknown designer, was installed in three windows in 1866.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInside the church, remnants of the original Norman building can be seen at opposite ends: in the west wall of the nave and the east end of the chancel.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The chancel, nave and aisles were rebuilt (to the same dimensions as the original building) when English Gothic architecture was at its height, and the [[chamfer]]ed arches, octagonal pillars, chancel arch, blind arches and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] are considered good examples of their kind.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=9.}}</ref>  The [[king post]] roof of the nave has also been praised.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInterior fittings include a 14th-century [[Easter sepulchre]] with an [[ogee]]-arched roof,<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> part of a [[sedilia]], some Norman [[frieze]]work,<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> and a 12th-century square [[Baptismal font|font]] in good condition.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/>\n\n==Today==\nSt James the Less Church was [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade I by [[English Heritage]] on 12 October 1954.<ref name=\"IoE297263\">{{NHLE|num=1192533|desc= The Parish Church of St James, Manor Road, Lancing, Adur, West Sussex|year=2007|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  Such buildings are defined as being of \"exceptional interest\" and greater than national importance.<ref name=\"EH2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |title=Listed Buildings |year=2010 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DEarkz4v?url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |archive-date=27 December 2012 |df= }}</ref>  As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and [[Listed buildings in Adur|119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district]].<ref name=\"IoEStats-WSx\">{{Cite web|title=Images of England \u2014 Statistics by County (West Sussex) |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |work=[[Images of England]] |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |year=2007 |access-date=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DNVqdtdK?url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |archive-date=2 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe style of worship in the church is Traditional Catholic.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/|title=St James the Less, Lancing|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  [[Holy Communion|Eucharistic]] services take place every Wednesday and Sunday: there are evening prayer services everyday, and Family Eucharist on the third Sunday each month.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames-Services\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/page/2593/|title=Services|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/135 parish], in its present form, covers {{convert|2236|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"VCH18216\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt1/pp34-53|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1 \u2013 Bramber Rape (Southern Part).
