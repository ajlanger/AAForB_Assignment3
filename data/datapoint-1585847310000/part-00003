In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia, indigenous peoples practiced agriculture, while in the remaining territory, peoples lived as hunter-gatherers, traveling by foot in eastern Patagonia or by [[canoe]] in the [[fjords and channels of Chile|fjords and channels]]. While the interest of the [[Spanish Empire]] had been chiefly to keep other European powers away from Patagonia, independent Chile and Argentina began to slowly colonize the territory over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This process brought a decline of the indigenous populations while at the same time thousands of Europeans, Argentines, [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilotes]] and mainland Chileans settled in Patagonia. [[Territorial dispute|Border disputes]] between Argentina and Chile were recurrent in the 20th century. Nearly all of these disputes have been settled today. \n\nThe contemporary economy of eastern Patagonia revolves around sheep farming and oil and gas extraction, while in western Patagonia [[fishing in Chile|fishing]], [[aquaculture in Chile|salmon aquaculture]] and [[Tourism in Chile|tourism]] dominates. Culturally, Patagonia has a varied heritage including [[Criollo people|Criollo]], [[Mestizo]], [[Indigenous peoples of South America|Indigenous]] and non-[[Iberians|Iberian European]] influences.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Patagonia comes from the word ''[[patagon|patag\u00f3n]]'',<ref name=\"Pigafetta\">[[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[:wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524: \"Il capitano generale nomin\u00f2 questi popoli Patagoni.\" [https://archive.org/stream/firstthreeenglis00arberich#page/252/mode/1up/search/Patagoni A Brief Declaration of the Vyage abowte the Worlde by Antonie Pygafetta Vincentine, Rycharde Eden, ''The Decades of the Newe Worlde or West India,'' London, William Powell, 1555.] The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patag\u00e3o'') or the Spanish of his men (''patag\u00f3n''). It has been interpreted later as \"big foot\", but the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early 16th century: \"''Patagon'', said to be engendred by a beast in the woods, being the strangest, most misshapen and counterfeite creature in the world. He hath good understanding, is amorous of women, and keepeth company with one of whom, it is said, he was engendred. He hath the face of a Dogge, great eares, which hang down upon his shoulders, his teeth sharp and big, standing out of his mouth very much: his feet are like a Harts, and he runneth wondrous lightly. Such as have seen him, tell marvelous matters of him, because he chaseth ordinarily among the mountains, with two Lyons in a chain like a lease, and a bow in his hand\".[http://eebo.chadwyck.com/search/full_rec?SOURCE=pgimages.cfg&ACTION=ByID&ID=99850463&FILE=&SEARCHSCREEN=param(SEARCHSCREEN)&VID=177262&PAGENO=238&ZOOM=50&VIEWPORT=&SEARCHCONFIG=param(SEARCHCONFIG)&DISPLAY=param(DISPLAY)&HIGHLIGHT_KEYWORD=param(HIGHLIGHT_KEYWORD) Anthony Munday, ''The Famous and Renowned Historie of Primaleon of Greece,'' 1619, cap.XXXIII: \"How Primaleon\u2026 found the Grand Patagon \".]</ref> which was used by Magellan in 1520 to describe the native tribes of the region, whom his expedition thought to be giants.

Both countries have organized their Patagonian territories into nonequivalent administrative subdivisions - [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] and [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] in Argentina, and [[Regions of Chile|regions]], [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]], and [[Communes of Chile|communes]] in Chile. As Chile is a [[unitary state]], its first-level administrative divisions\u2014the regions\u2014enjoy far less autonomy than analogous Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces have elected governors and legislatures, while Chilean regions have government-appointed intendants.\n\nThe Patagonian Provinces of Argentina are [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]], [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego]]. The southernmost part of [[Buenos Aires Province]] can also be considered part of Patagonia.\n\nThe two Chilean regions indisputedly located entirely within Patagonia are [[Ays\u00e9n Region|Ays\u00e9n]] and [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes]]. [[Palena Province]], a part of the [[Los Lagos Region]], is also located within Patagonia. By some definitions, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, the rest of the Los Lagos Region, and part of the Los R\u00edos Region are also part of Patagonia.\n\n==Climate==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2011}}\n{{See also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina|Climate of Chile}}\n[[File:Punta Arenas con nieve.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Punta Arenas, Chile, in winter]]\nThe overall climate is cool and dry. The east coast is warmer than the west, especially in summer, as a branch of the southern equatorial current reaches its shores, whereas the west coast is washed by a cold current. However, winters are colder on the inland plateaus east of the slopes and further down the coast on the southeast end of the Patagonian region. For example, at [[Puerto Montt]], on the inlet behind Chilo\u00e9 Island, the mean annual temperature is {{convert|11|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|25.5|and|-1.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, whereas at [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] near the Atlantic coast and just outside the northern confines of Patagonia, the annual temperature is {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the range much greater, as temperatures above 35&nbsp;\u00b0C and below \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C are recorded every year. At Punta Arenas, in the extreme south, the mean temperature is {{convert|6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|24.5|and|-2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The prevailing winds are westerly, and the westward slope has a much heavier precipitation than the eastern in a [[rainshadow]] effect;<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> the western islands close to [[Torres del Paine]] receive an annual precipitation of 4,000 to 7,000&nbsp;mm, whilst the eastern hills are less than 800&nbsp;mm and the plains may be as low as 200&nbsp;mm annual precipitation.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/>\n\nPrecipitation is highly seasonal in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, close to the border with Chile, receives up to 434&nbsp;mm of rain and snow in May, 297&nbsp;mm in June, and 273 in July, compared to 80 in February and 72 in March. The total for the city is 2074&nbsp;mm, making it one of the rainiest in Argentina. Further west, some areas receive up to 4,000&nbsp;mm and more, especially on the Chilean side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed; most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms, but totals barely reach 500&nbsp;mm in the northeast corner, and rapidly decrease to less than 300&nbsp;mm. The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from 14&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south to 19&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north (and nights between 5 and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C) and very high precipitation, from 2,000 to more than 7,000&nbsp;mm in local microclimates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north, but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.\n\nImmediately east from the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords in the south and by deep lakes in the north, and with varying temperatures according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600\u2013800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Fr\u00edas, in Argentina, receives 4,400&nbsp;mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40&nbsp;km further east, receives about 1,000&nbsp;mm, and the airport, another 15&nbsp;km east, receives less than 600&nbsp;mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Mart\u00edn de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bols\u00f3n, Esquel, and El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20 and 24&nbsp;\u00b0C, with cold nights between 4 and 9&nbsp;\u00b0C; in the south, summers are between 16 and 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3 to 9&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, and from 0 to 7&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, whereas nights range from \u22125 to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values; a temperature of -21&nbsp;\u00b0C has been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often have temperatures between \u221212 and \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C and highs staying around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for a few days.\n\n[[File:Lago Buenos Aires Department, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina - panoramio (37).jpg|thumb|Santa Cruz Province]]\nDirectly east of these areas, the weather becomes much harsher; precipitation drops to between 150 and 300&nbsp;mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao is a few hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer, rising up to 35&nbsp;\u00b0C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is \u221235&nbsp;\u00b0C, and some nights not uncommonly reach 10&nbsp;\u00b0C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C every once in a while.\n\nThe northern Atlantic coast has warm summers (28 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, but with relatively cool nights at 15&nbsp;\u00b0C) and mild winters, with highs around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and lows about 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b0C. Occasionally, temperatures reach \u221210 or 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, and rainfall is very scarce. The weather only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, and the city of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24 to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C, nights of 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, and winters with days around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and nights around 3&nbsp;\u00b0C, and less than 250&nbsp;mm of rain. However, a drastic drop occurs as one moves south to Santa Cruz; Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17 to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C, (nights between 6 and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and winter temperatures of 2 to 6&nbsp;\u00b0C, with nights between \u22125 and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100&nbsp;km/h occasionally.\n\nTierra del Fuego is extremely wet in the west, relatively damp in the south, and dry in the north and east. Summers are cool (13 to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, with nights generally between 3 and 8&nbsp;\u00b0C), cloudy in the south, and very windy. Winters are dark and cold, but without the extreme temperatures in the south and west ([[Ushuaia]] rarely reaches \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C, but hovers around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for several months, and snow can be heavy). In the east and north, winters are much more severe, with cold snaps bringing temperatures down to \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C all the way to Rio Grande on the Atlantic coast. Snow can fall even in the summer in most areas, as well.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Black-browed Albatross, Beagle Channel.jpg|thumb|[[Black-browed albatross]], near Ushuaia]]\n\nThe [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), [[cougar]], the [[South American gray fox|Patagonian fox]] (''Lycalopex griseus''), [[Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk|Patagonian hog-nosed skunk]] (''Conepatus humboldtii''), and [[Magellanic tuco-tuco]] (''Ctenomys magellanicus''; a subterranean [[rodent]]) are the most characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains.

Tehuelches included the [[Gununa'kena]] to the north, [[Mecharnuekenk]] in south central Patagonia, and the [[Tehuelche people|Aonikenk]] or Southern Tehuelche in the far south, north of the Magellan strait. On [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]], the [[Selk'nam]] (Ona) and [[Haush]] (Manek'enk) lived in the north and southeast, respectively.

These groups were encountered in the first periods of European contact with different lifestyles, body decoration and language, although it is unclear when this configuration emerged.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, [[Mapuche]]-speaking agriculturalists penetrated the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region in a short period of time, and are the principal indigenous community today.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> The Mapuche model of domination through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding, but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Early European exploration (1520\u20131669)===\n[[File:NaoVictoria.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Victoria (ship)|''Nao Victoria'']], the replica of [[Museo Nao Victoria|the first ship]] to pass through the [[Strait of Magellan]]]]\n\nThis territory became the Spanish colony of the Governorate of New L\u00e9on, granted in 1529 to Governor [[Sim\u00f3n de Alcazaba y Sotomayor]], part of the [[Governorates of the Spanish Empire]] of the Americas, and redefined territory in 1534, it consisted of the southernmost part of the continent covering the southern tip of the Americas and the islands towards Antarctica.\n\nNavigators such as [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] possibly had reached the area (his own account of 1502 has it that they reached the latitude 52\u00b0S), but Vespucci's failure to accurately describe the main geographical features of the region such as the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] casts doubts on whether they really did so.\n\nThe first or more detailed description of part of the coastline of Patagonia is possibly mentioned in a Portuguese voyage in 1511\u20131512, traditionally attributed to captain Diogo Ribeiro, who after his death was replaced by Estev\u00e3o de Frois, and was guided by the pilot and [[Cosmography|cosmographer]] [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]]).

After the discovery of the route around Cape Horn, the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the 18th century, when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San Jos\u00e9, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty over area.\n\nIn 1669, the district around [[Puerto Deseado]] was explored by [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] and was claimed in 1670 by Sir [[John Narborough]] for King [[Charles II of England]], but the English made no attempt to establish settlements or explore the interior.\n\n====Patagonian giants: early European perceptions====\n{{main|Patagon}}\nThe first European explorers of Patagonia observed that the indigenous people in the region were taller than the average Europeans of the time, prompting some of them to believe that Patagonians were giants.\n\nAccording to Antonio Pigafetta,<ref name=\"Pigafetta\"/> one of the Magellan expedition's few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name ''Patag\u00e3o'' (or ''Patag\u00f3n'') on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name \"Patagonia\" for the region. Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning \"land of the big feet\". However, this [[etymology]] is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or [[Knight-errant|knight-errantry tale]]) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Growth and Development |editor1-first=Stanley J. |editor1-last=Ulijaszek |editor2-first=Francis E. |editor2-last=Johnston |editor3-first=M.

Magellan's perception of the natives, dressed in skins, and eating raw meat, clearly recalled the uncivilized Patag\u00f3n in V\u00e1zquez's book. Novelist and travel writer [[Bruce Chatwin]] suggests etymological roots of both Patagon and Patagonia in his book, ''[[In Patagonia]]'',<ref>Chatwin, Bruce. ''In Patagonia'' (1977). ch. 49</ref> noting the similarity between \"Patagon\" and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which means \"a roaring\" or \"gnashing of teeth\" (in his chronicle, Pigafetta describes the Patagonians as \"roaring like bulls\").\n\n[[File:Urville-Patagonians2.jpg|thumb|An 1840s illustration of indigenous Patagonians from near the [[Straits of Magellan]], from ''Voyage au pole sud et dans l'Oc\u00e9anie'' by French explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]]]\nThe main interest in the region sparked by Pigafetta's account came from his reports of their meeting with the local inhabitants, whom they claimed to measure some 9 to 12 feet in height \u2013 \"so tall that we reached only to his waist\" \u2013 hence the later idea that Patagonia meant \"big feet\". This supposed race of Patagonian giants or [[Patagon]]es entered into the common European perception of this then little-known and distant area, to be further fueled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous travelers such as Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the [[New World]] sometimes added the legend ''regio gigantum'' (\"region of the giants\") to the Patagonian area. By 1611, the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of ''The Tempest''.\n\nThe concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years, and was to be sensationally reignited in 1767 when an \"official\" (but anonymous) account was published of [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] [[John Byron]]'s recent voyage of global [[circumnavigation]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']]. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (''Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin'') seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight bestseller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily republished (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).\n\nHowever, the Patagonian giant frenzy died down substantially only a few years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773, [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] published on behalf of the [[Admiralty]] a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of [[James Cook]] and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, the people Byron's expedition had encountered clearly were no taller than {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}}, very tall but by no means giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the concept persisted in some quarters even into the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web| author=Carolyne Ryan| title=European Travel Writings and the Patagonian giants| work=Lawrence University| url=http://www.lawrence.edu/news/pubs/lt/fall04/giants.shtml| accessdate=24 October 2013| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120805051711/http://www.lawrence.edu/news/pubs/lt/fall04/giants.shtml| archivedate=5 August 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish outposts===\nThe Spanish failure at colonizing the Strait of Magellan made [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]] assume the role of protecting the area of western Patagonia from foreign intrusions.<ref name=Urbina2013>{{cite journal |last=Urbina C. |first=M.

[[Thomas Falkner]], a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his ''Description of Patagonia'' (Hereford, 1774); [[Francisco Viedma]] founded ''El Carmen'', nowadays [[Carmen de Patagones]] and Antonio settled the area of [[San Julian Bay]], where he founded the colony of [[Floridablanca (Patagonia)|Floridablanca]] and advanced inland to the Andes (1782). [[Basilio Villarino]] ascended the Rio Negro (1782).\n[[File:MORENO(1879) p131 UNA FIESTA EN CALEUFU.JPG|thumb|[[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] warriors in Patagonia]]\n\nTwo [[hydrography|hydrographic]] surveys of the coasts were of first-rate importance; the first expedition (1826\u20131830) included [[HMS Aid (1809)|HMS ''Adventure'']] and [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] under [[Phillip Parker King]], and the second (1832\u20131836) was the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']] under [[Robert FitzRoy]]. The latter expedition is particularly noted for the participation of [[Charles Darwin]], who spent considerable time investigating various areas of Patagonia onshore, including long rides with [[gaucho]]s in [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|R\u00edo Negro]], and who joined FitzRoy in a {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} expedition taking ships' boats up the course of the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]].\n\n===Chilean and Argentine colonization (1843\u20131902)===\nIn the early 19th century, the [[Araucanization of Patagonia|araucanization]] of the natives of northern Patagonia intensified, and many [[Mapuche]]s migrated to Patagonia to live as nomads that raised cattle or pillaged the Argentine countryside. The cattle stolen in the incursions (''[[Mal\u00f3n|malones]]'') were later taken to Chile through the mountain passes and traded for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called [[Camino de los chilenos]] and runs a length around 1000&nbsp;km from the [[Buenos Aires Province]] to the [[mountain pass]]es of [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]]. The ''[[lonco]]'' [[Calfucur\u00e1]] crossed the [[Andes]] from Chile to the pampas around 1830, after a call from the governor of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], to fight the [[Boroano people]]. In 1859, he attacked [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. As in the case of Calfucura, many other bands of Mapuches got involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until [[Conquest of the Desert]]. To counter the cattle raids, a trench called the [[Zanja de Alsina]] was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s.\n\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|210px|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of [[zanja de Alsina]]]]\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the newly independent nations of Argentina and Chile began an aggressive phase of expansion into the south, increasing confrontation with the Indians of the region. In 1860, French adventurer [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]] proclaimed himself king of the [[Kingdom of Araucan\u00eda and Patagonia]] of the [[Mapuche]].\n\nFollowing the last instructions of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], the Chilean president [[Manuel Bulnes]] sent an expedition to the Strait of Magellan and founded [[Fuerte Bulnes]] in 1843. Five years later, the Chilean government moved the main settlement to the current location of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], the oldest permanent settlement in Southern Patagonia. The creation of Punta Arenas was instrumental in making Chile's claim of the Strait of Magellan permanent. In the 1860s, sheep from the [[Falkland Islands]] were introduced to the lands around the Straits of Magellan, and throughout the 19th century, sheepfarming grew to be the most important economic sector in southern Patagonia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[George Chaworth Musters]] in 1869 wandered in company with a band of Tehuelches through the whole length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the northwest, and collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=19679|first=John|last=Dickenson|title=Musters, George Chaworth}}</ref>\n\n====Conquest of the desert and the 1881 treaty====\n{{Main|Conquest of the Desert|Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina}}\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|170px|left|Under General [[Julio Argentino Roca|Roca]], the [[Conquest of the Desert]] extended Argentine power into Patagonia]]\nArgentine authorities worried that the strong connections araucanized tribes had with Chile would allegedly give Chile certain influence over the pampas.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\">{{cite journal|jstor=981291 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=347\u2013363|title=Argentina and Chile: The Struggle For Patagonia 1843\u20131881| journal=The Americas | last1=Perry | first1=Richard O. | year=1980 | doi=10.2307/981291 }}</ref> Argentine authorities feared an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, where the natives would side with the Chileans and that it would therefore be fought in the vicinities of Buenos Aires.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\"/>\n \nThe decision of planning and executing the Conquest of the Desert was probably triggered by the 1872 attack of [[Cufulcur\u00e1]] and his 6,000 followers on the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]], and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]], where 300 ''[[Creole peoples|criollos]]'' were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken.\n\nIn the 1870s, the Conquest of the Desert was a controversial campaign by the Argentine government, executed mainly by [[General Julio Argentino Roca]], to subdue or, some claim, to exterminate the native peoples of the south.\n\nIn 1885, a mining expeditionary party under the [[Romania]]n adventurer [[Julius Popper]] landed in southern Patagonia in search of gold, which they found after traveling southwards towards the lands of Tierra del Fuego. This led to the further opening up of the area to prospectors. European missionaries and settlers arrived throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, notably the [[Y Wladfa|Welsh settlement]] of the [[Chubut Valley]].

As [[manual labor]], their social status was below that of the'' [[gaucho]]s'' and the Argentine, Chilean, and European landowners and administrators.\n\nBefore and after 1902, when the boundaries were drawn, many Chilotes were expelled from the Argentine side due to fear of what having a large Chilean population in Argentina could lead into in the future. These workers founded the first inland Chilean settlement in what is now the [[Ays\u00e9n Region]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turistel.cl/v2/secciones/destinos/ciudad_pueblo/sur/undecima/coihaique.htm |title=Coihaique \u2013 Ciudades y Pueblos del sur de Chile |publisher=Turistel.cl |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=Fuego>Luis Otero, La Huella del Fuego: Historia de los bosques y cambios en el paisaje del sur de Chile (Valdivia, Editorial Pehuen)</ref> [[Balmaceda, Chile|Balmaceda]].

Railways were planned to cover continental Argentine Patagonia to serve the oil, mining, agricultural, and energy industries, and a line was built connecting [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] to Buenos Aires. Portions of other lines were built to the south, but the only lines still in use are [[La Trochita]] in [[Esquel]], the [[Train of the End of the World]] in Ushuaia, both [[heritage line]]s,<ref>[http://www.latrochita.org.ar/TrochiIngles/historia.htm History of the Old Patagonian Express], La Trochita, accessed 2006-08-11</ref>\nand a short run Tren Hist\u00f3rico de [[San Carlos de Bariloche|Bariloche]] to Perito Moreno.\n\nIn the western forest-covered Patagonian Andes and archipelagoes, [[wood logging]] has historically been an important part of the economy; it impelled the colonization of the areas of the [[Nahuel Huapi Lake|Nahuel Huapi]] and [[L\u00e1car Lake|L\u00e1car]] lakes in Argentina and [[Guaitecas Archipelago]] in Chile.\n\n===Livestock===\n{{see also|Patagonian sheep farming boom}}\n[[File:Mustering sheep in Patagonia.jpg|thumb|''Gauchos'' mustering sheep in Patagonia]]\n\nSheep farming introduced in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays, about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the pampas to the north. Chubut (mainly [[Merino]]) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still, little investment occurs in new abattoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew, and Rio Gallegos), and often [[Phytosanitary certification|phytosanitary]] restrictions reduce the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the [[Cordilleran range]] have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.\n\nLivestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers, pigs and horses. Sheep farming provides a small but important number of jobs for rural areas with little other employment.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Ballenas en Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|Whale watching off the [[Valdes Peninsula]]]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more important part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding [[Cape Horn]] or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the [[Perito Moreno glacier]], the [[Vald\u00e9s Peninsula]], the [[Argentine Lake District]] and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping-off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.<ref name=\"time out\"/>\n\nA spin-off from increased tourism has been the buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Ted Turner]], and [[Christopher Lambert]], and most notably [[Luciano Benetton]], Patagonia's largest landowner.<ref name=\"time out\"/> His \"Compa\u00f1ia de Tierras Sud\" has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local Mapuche communities.<ref>[http://www.mapuche-nation.org/english/main/benetton/main/info.htm 'The Invisible Colors of Benetton'], [[Mapuche International Link]], accessed 2006-08-11</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n<br />\n\n[[File:LaTrochita12EnNahuelPanFormacionEstacionada.jpg|thumb|''[[La Trochita]]'' on its [[Chubut Province]] route: Formerly the sole rapid transport means in the province, ''La Trochita'' is now a tourist attraction.]]\nDue to its sparse rainfall in agricultural areas, Argentine Patagonia already has numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower. The [[Limay River]] is used to generate hydroelectricity at five dams built on its course: [[Alicur\u00e1 Dam|Alicur\u00e1]], [[Piedra del \u00c1guila Dam|Piedra del \u00c1guila]], [[Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa Dam|Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa]], [[El Choc\u00f3n Dam|El Choc\u00f3n]], and [[Arroyito Dam|Arroyito]]. Together with the [[Cerros Colorados Complex]] on the [[Neuqu\u00e9n River]], they contribute ore than one-quarter of the total hydroelectric generation in the country. Coal is mined in the [[Rio Turbio]] area and used for electricity generation. Patagonia's notorious winds have already made the area Argentina's main source of wind power, and plans have been made for major increases in wind power generation.\nPatagonia has always been Argentina's main area, and Chile's only area, of conventional oil and gas production. Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuqu\u00e9n-Cipolleti as Patagonia's most populous urban area, and in the growth of [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], Punta Arenas, and Rio Grande, as well. The development of the Neuqu\u00e9n basin's enormous [[unconventional oil]] and gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing has just begun, but the [[YPF]]-[[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Loma Campana field in the Vaca Muerta formation is already the world's largest producing shale oil field outside North America according to former YPF CEO Miguel Gallucio.\n\n==Cuisine==\nArgentine Patagonian cuisine is largely the same as the cuisine of Buenos Aires \u2013 grilled meats and pasta \u2013 with extensive{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products that have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and ''[[centolla]]'' ([[king crab]]) are also common, though overfishing of ''centolla'' has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, a noted [[Alpine cuisine]] tradition remains, with chocolate bars and even [[fondue]] restaurants, and [[tea room]]s are a feature of the [[Welsh_people|Welsh]] communities in [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]] and [[Trevelin]], as well as in the mountains.<ref name=\"time out\"/> Since the mid-1990s, some success with winemaking has occurred in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuqu\u00e9n.\n\n==Foreign land buyers issue==\nForeign investors, including Italian multinational [[Benetton Group]], [[Ted Turner]], Joseph Lewis<ref name=\"patagonia-argentina.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/i/content/accesoalagosyrios.php |title=''Rivers of blood''from Patagonia-argentina.com}}</ref> and the environmentalist [[Douglas Tompkins]], own major land areas.

In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia indigenous peoples practised agriculture while in the remaining territory peoples lived as hunter-gatherers travelling by foot in eastern Patagonia or by canoe in the [[fjords and channels of Chile|fjords and channels]]. While the interest of the [[Spanish Empire]] had been chiefly to keep other European powers away from Patagonia, once independent Chile and Argentina begun to slowly colonise the territory over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This process brought a decline of the indigenous populations while at the same time thousands of Europeans, Argentines, [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilotes]] and mainland Chileans settled in Patagonia. Border disputes between Argentina and Chile were recurrent in the 20th century. Nearly all of these disputes have been settled today. \n\nThe contemporary economy of Patagonia revolves around sheep farming and oil and gas extraction are important activities for the eastern part while in western Patagonia [[fishing in Chile|fishing]], [[aquaculture in Chile|salmon aquaculture]] and tourism dominates. Culturally Patagonia has a varied heritage including [[Criollo people|Criollo]], [[Mestizo]], [[Indigenous peoples of South America|Indigenous]] and non-Iberian European influences.     \n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Patagonia comes from the word ''[[patagon|patag\u00f3n]]'',<ref name=\"Pigafetta\">[[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[:wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524: \"Il capitano generale nomin\u00f2 questi popoli Patagoni.\" [https://archive.org/stream/firstthreeenglis00arberich#page/252/mode/1up/search/Patagoni A Brief Declaration of the Vyage abowte the Worlde by Antonie Pygafetta Vincentine, Rycharde Eden, ''The Decades of the Newe Worlde or West India,'' London, William Powell, 1555.] The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patag\u00e3o'') or the Spanish of his men (''patag\u00f3n''). It has been interpreted later as \"big foot\", but the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early 16th century: \"''Patagon'', said to be engendred by a beast in the woods, being the strangest, most misshapen and counterfeite creature in the world. He hath good understanding, is amorous of women, and keepeth company with one of whom, it is said, he was engendred. He hath the face of a Dogge, great eares, which hang down upon his shoulders, his teeth sharp and big, standing out of his mouth very much: his feet are like a Harts, and he runneth wondrous lightly.

Both countries have organized their Patagonian territories into nonequivalent administrative subdivisions - [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] and [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] in Argentina, and [[Regions of Chile|regions]], [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]], and [[Communes of Chile|communes]] in Chile. As Chile is a [[unitary state]], its first-level administrative divisions\u2014the regions\u2014enjoy far less autonomy than analogous Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces have elected governors and legislatures, while Chilean regions have government-appointed intendants.\n\nThe Patagonian Provinces of Argentina are [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]], [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego]]. The southernmost part of [[Buenos Aires Province]] can also be considered part of Patagonia.\n\nThe two Chilean regions indisputedly located entirely within Patagonia are [[Ays\u00e9n Region|Ays\u00e9n]] and [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes]]. [[Palena Province]], a part of the [[Los Lagos Region]], is also located within Patagonia. By some definitions, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, the rest of the Los Lagos Region, and part of the Los R\u00edos Region are also part of Patagonia.\n\n==Climate==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2011}}\n{{See also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina|Climate of Chile}}\n[[File:Punta Arenas con nieve.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Punta Arenas, Chile, in winter]]\nThe overall climate is cool and dry. The east coast is warmer than the west, especially in summer, as a branch of the southern equatorial current reaches its shores, whereas the west coast is washed by a cold current. However, winters are colder on the inland plateaus east of the slopes and further down the coast on the southeast end of the Patagonian region. For example, at [[Puerto Montt]], on the inlet behind Chilo\u00e9 Island, the mean annual temperature is {{convert|11|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|25.5|and|-1.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, whereas at [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] near the Atlantic coast and just outside the northern confines of Patagonia, the annual temperature is {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the range much greater, as temperatures above 35&nbsp;\u00b0C and below \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C are recorded every year. At Punta Arenas, in the extreme south, the mean temperature is {{convert|6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and the average extremes are {{convert|24.5|and|-2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The prevailing winds are westerly, and the westward slope has a much heavier precipitation than the eastern in a [[rainshadow]] effect;<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> the western islands close to [[Torres del Paine]] receive an annual precipitation of 4,000 to 7,000&nbsp;mm, whilst the eastern hills are less than 800&nbsp;mm and the plains may be as low as 200&nbsp;mm annual precipitation.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/>\n\nPrecipitation is highly seasonal in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, close to the border with Chile, receives up to 434&nbsp;mm of rain and snow in May, 297&nbsp;mm in June, and 273 in July, compared to 80 in February and 72 in March. The total for the city is 2074&nbsp;mm, making it one of the rainiest in Argentina. Further west, some areas receive up to 4,000&nbsp;mm and more, especially on the Chilean side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed; most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms, but totals barely reach 500&nbsp;mm in the northeast corner, and rapidly decrease to less than 300&nbsp;mm. The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from 14&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south to 19&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north (and nights between 5 and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C) and very high precipitation, from 2,000 to more than 7,000&nbsp;mm in local microclimates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north, but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.\n\nImmediately east from the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords in the south and by deep lakes in the north, and with varying temperatures according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600\u2013800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Fr\u00edas, in Argentina, receives 4,400&nbsp;mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40&nbsp;km further east, receives about 1,000&nbsp;mm, and the airport, another 15&nbsp;km east, receives less than 600&nbsp;mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Mart\u00edn de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bols\u00f3n, Esquel, and El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20 and 24&nbsp;\u00b0C, with cold nights between 4 and 9&nbsp;\u00b0C; in the south, summers are between 16 and 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3 to 9&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, and from 0 to 7&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, whereas nights range from \u22125 to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values; a temperature of -21&nbsp;\u00b0C has been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often have temperatures between \u221212 and \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C and highs staying around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for a few days.\n\n[[File:Lago Buenos Aires Department, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina - panoramio (37).jpg|thumb|Santa Cruz Province]]\nDirectly east of these areas, the weather becomes much harsher; precipitation drops to between 150 and 300&nbsp;mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao is a few hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer, rising up to 35&nbsp;\u00b0C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is \u221235&nbsp;\u00b0C, and some nights not uncommonly reach 10&nbsp;\u00b0C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C every once in a while.\n\nThe northern Atlantic coast has warm summers (28 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, but with relatively cool nights at 15&nbsp;\u00b0C) and mild winters, with highs around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and lows about 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b0C. Occasionally, temperatures reach \u221210 or 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, and rainfall is very scarce. The weather only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, and the city of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24 to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C, nights of 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, and winters with days around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and nights around 3&nbsp;\u00b0C, and less than 250&nbsp;mm of rain. However, a drastic drop occurs as one moves south to Santa Cruz; Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17 to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C, (nights between 6 and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and winter temperatures of 2 to 6&nbsp;\u00b0C, with nights between \u22125 and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100&nbsp;km/h occasionally.\n\nTierra del Fuego is extremely wet in the west, relatively damp in the south, and dry in the north and east. Summers are cool (13 to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C in the north, 12 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C in the south, with nights generally between 3 and 8&nbsp;\u00b0C), cloudy in the south, and very windy. Winters are dark and cold, but without the extreme temperatures in the south and west ([[Ushuaia]] rarely reaches \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C, but hovers around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for several months, and snow can be heavy). In the east and north, winters are much more severe, with cold snaps bringing temperatures down to \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C all the way to Rio Grande on the Atlantic coast. Snow can fall even in the summer in most areas, as well.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Black-browed Albatross, Beagle Channel.jpg|thumb|[[Black-browed albatross]], near Ushuaia]]\n\nThe [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), [[cougar]], the [[South American gray fox|Patagonian fox]] (''Lycalopex griseus''), [[Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk|Patagonian hog-nosed skunk]] (''Conepatus humboldtii''), and [[Magellanic tuco-tuco]] (''Ctenomys magellanicus''; a subterranean [[rodent]]) are the most characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains.

Tehuelches included the [[Gununa'kena]] to the north, [[Mecharnuekenk]] in south central Patagonia, and the [[Tehuelche people|Aonikenk]] or Southern Tehuelche in the far south, north of the Magellan strait. On [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]], the [[Selk'nam]] (Ona) and [[Haush]] (Manek'enk) lived in the north and southeast, respectively.

These groups were encountered in the first periods of European contact with different lifestyles, body decoration and language, although it is unclear when this configuration emerged.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, [[Mapuche]]-speaking agriculturalists penetrated the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region in a short period of time, and are the principal indigenous community today.<ref name=\"Princeton\"/> The Mapuche model of domination through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding, but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Early European exploration (1520\u20131669)===\n[[File:NaoVictoria.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Victoria (ship)|''Nao Victoria'']], the replica of [[Museo Nao Victoria|the first ship]] to pass through the [[Strait of Magellan]]]]\n\nThis territory became the Spanish colony of the Governorate of New L\u00e9on, granted in 1529 to Governor [[Sim\u00f3n de Alcazaba y Sotomayor]], part of the [[Governorates of the Spanish Empire]] of the Americas, and redefined territory in 1534, it consisted of the southernmost part of the continent covering the southern tip of the Americas and the islands towards Antarctica.\n\nNavigators such as [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] possibly had reached the area (his own account of 1502 has it that they reached the latitude 52\u00b0S), but Vespucci's failure to accurately describe the main geographical features of the region such as the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] casts doubts on whether they really did so.\n\nThe first or more detailed description of part of the coastline of Patagonia is possibly mentioned in a Portuguese voyage in 1511\u20131512, traditionally attributed to captain Diogo Ribeiro, who after his death was replaced by Estev\u00e3o de Frois, and was guided by the pilot and [[Cosmography|cosmographer]] [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]]).

The settlements that he founded at [[Nombre de Jes\u00fas (Patagonia)|Nombre de Jes\u00fas]] and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before [[Thomas Cavendish]] visited it in 1587, and so desolate that he called it [[Puerto del Hambre|Port Famine]]. After the discovery of the route around Cape Horn, the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the 18th century, when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San Jos\u00e9, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty over area.\n\nIn 1669, the district around [[Puerto Deseado]] was explored by [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] and was claimed in 1670 by Sir [[John Narborough]] for King [[Charles II of England]], but the English made no attempt to establish settlements or explore the interior.\n\n====Patagonian giants: early European perceptions====\n{{main|Patagon}}\nThe first European explorers of Patagonia observed that the indigenous people in the region were taller than the average Europeans of the time, prompting some of them to believe that Patagonians were giants.\n\nAccording to Antonio Pigafetta,<ref name=\"Pigafetta\"/> one of the Magellan expedition's few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name ''Patag\u00e3o'' (or ''Patag\u00f3n'') on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name \"Patagonia\" for the region. Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning \"land of the big feet\". However, this [[etymology]] is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or [[Knight-errant|knight-errantry tale]]) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Growth and Development |editor1-first=Stanley J. |editor1-last=Ulijaszek |editor2-first=Francis E. |editor2-last=Johnston |editor3-first=M.

This supposed race of Patagonian giants or [[Patagon]]es entered into the common European perception of this then little-known and distant area, to be further fueled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous travelers such as Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the [[New World]] sometimes added the legend ''regio gigantum'' (\"region of the giants\") to the Patagonian area. By 1611, the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of ''The Tempest''.\n\nThe concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years, and was to be sensationally reignited in 1767 when an \"official\" (but anonymous) account was published of [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] [[John Byron]]'s recent voyage of global [[circumnavigation]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']]. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (''Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin'') seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight bestseller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily republished (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).\n\nHowever, the Patagonian giant frenzy died down substantially only a few years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773, [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] published on behalf of the [[Admiralty]] a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of [[James Cook]] and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, the people Byron's expedition had encountered clearly were no taller than {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}}, very tall but by no means giants.

[[Thomas Falkner]], a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his ''Description of Patagonia'' (Hereford, 1774); [[Francisco Viedma]] founded ''El Carmen'', nowadays [[Carmen de Patagones]] and Antonio settled the area of [[San Julian Bay]], where he founded the colony of [[Floridablanca (Patagonia)|Floridablanca]] and advanced inland to the Andes (1782).

The latter expedition is particularly noted for the participation of [[Charles Darwin]], who spent considerable time investigating various areas of Patagonia onshore, including long rides with [[gaucho]]s in [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|R\u00edo Negro]], and who joined FitzRoy in a {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} expedition taking ships' boats up the course of the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]].\n\n===Chilean and Argentine colonization (1843\u20131902)===\nIn the early 19th century, the [[Araucanization of Patagonia|araucanization]] of the natives of northern Patagonia intensified, and many [[Mapuche]]s migrated to Patagonia to live as nomads that raised cattle or pillaged the Argentine countryside. The cattle stolen in the incursions (''[[Mal\u00f3n|malones]]'') were later taken to Chile through the mountain passes and traded for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called [[Camino de los chilenos]] and runs a length around 1000&nbsp;km from the [[Buenos Aires Province]] to the [[mountain pass]]es of [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]]. The ''[[lonco]]'' [[Calfucur\u00e1]] crossed the [[Andes]] from Chile to the pampas around 1830, after a call from the governor of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], to fight the [[Boroano people]]. In 1859, he attacked [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]] in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. As in the case of Calfucura, many other bands of Mapuches got involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until [[Conquest of the Desert]]. To counter the cattle raids, a trench called the [[Zanja de Alsina]] was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s.\n\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|210px|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of [[zanja de Alsina]]]]\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the newly independent nations of Argentina and Chile began an aggressive phase of expansion into the south, increasing confrontation with the Indians of the region. In 1860, French adventurer [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]] proclaimed himself king of the [[Kingdom of Araucan\u00eda and Patagonia]] of the [[Mapuche]].\n\nFollowing the last instructions of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], the Chilean president [[Manuel Bulnes]] sent an expedition to the Strait of Magellan and founded [[Fuerte Bulnes]] in 1843. Five years later, the Chilean government moved the main settlement to the current location of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], the oldest permanent settlement in Southern Patagonia. The creation of Punta Arenas was instrumental in making Chile's claim of the Strait of Magellan permanent. In the 1860s, sheep from the [[Falkland Islands]] were introduced to the lands around the Straits of Magellan, and throughout the 19th century, sheepfarming grew to be the most important economic sector in southern Patagonia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[George Chaworth Musters]] in 1869 wandered in company with a band of Tehuelches through the whole length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the northwest, and collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=19679|first=John|last=Dickenson|title=Musters, George Chaworth}}</ref>\n\n====Conquest of the desert and the 1881 treaty====\n{{Main|Conquest of the Desert|Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina}}\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|170px|left|Under General [[Julio Argentino Roca|Roca]], the [[Conquest of the Desert]] extended Argentine power into Patagonia]]\nArgentine authorities worried that the strong connections araucanized tribes had with Chile would allegedly give Chile certain influence over the pampas.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\">{{cite journal|jstor=981291 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=347\u2013363|title=Argentina and Chile: The Struggle For Patagonia 1843\u20131881| journal=The Americas | last1=Perry | first1=Richard O. | year=1980 | doi=10.2307/981291 }}</ref> Argentine authorities feared an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, where the natives would side with the Chileans and that it would therefore be fought in the vicinities of Buenos Aires.<ref name=\"cite journal|jstor=981291\"/>\n \nThe decision of planning and executing the Conquest of the Desert was probably triggered by the 1872 attack of [[Cufulcur\u00e1]] and his 6,000 followers on the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]], and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]], where 300 ''[[Creole peoples|criollos]]'' were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken.\n\nIn the 1870s, the Conquest of the Desert was a controversial campaign by the Argentine government, executed mainly by [[General Julio Argentino Roca]], to subdue or, some claim, to exterminate the native peoples of the south.\n\nIn 1885, a mining expeditionary party under the [[Romania]]n adventurer [[Julius Popper]] landed in southern Patagonia in search of gold, which they found after traveling southwards towards the lands of Tierra del Fuego. This led to the further opening up of the area to prospectors.

After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays, about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the pampas to the north. Chubut (mainly [[Merino]]) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still, little investment occurs in new abattoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew, and Rio Gallegos), and often [[Phytosanitary certification|phytosanitary]] restrictions reduce the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the [[Cordilleran range]] have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.\n\nLivestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers, pigs and horses. Sheep farming provides a small but important number of jobs for rural areas with little other employment.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Ballenas en Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|Whale watching off the [[Valdes Peninsula]]]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more important part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding [[Cape Horn]] or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the [[Perito Moreno glacier]], the [[Vald\u00e9s Peninsula]], the [[Argentine Lake District]] and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping-off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.<ref name=\"time out\"/>\n\nA spin-off from increased tourism has been the buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Ted Turner]], and [[Christopher Lambert]], and most notably [[Luciano Benetton]], Patagonia's largest landowner.<ref name=\"time out\"/> His \"Compa\u00f1ia de Tierras Sud\" has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local Mapuche communities.<ref>[http://www.mapuche-nation.org/english/main/benetton/main/info.htm 'The Invisible Colors of Benetton'], [[Mapuche International Link]], accessed 2006-08-11</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n<br />\n\n[[File:LaTrochita12EnNahuelPanFormacionEstacionada.jpg|thumb|''[[La Trochita]]'' on its [[Chubut Province]] route: Formerly the sole rapid transport means in the province, ''La Trochita'' is now a tourist attraction.]]\nDue to its sparse rainfall in agricultural areas, Argentine Patagonia already has numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower. The [[Limay River]] is used to generate hydroelectricity at five dams built on its course: [[Alicur\u00e1 Dam|Alicur\u00e1]], [[Piedra del \u00c1guila Dam|Piedra del \u00c1guila]], [[Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa Dam|Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa]], [[El Choc\u00f3n Dam|El Choc\u00f3n]], and [[Arroyito Dam|Arroyito]]. Together with the [[Cerros Colorados Complex]] on the [[Neuqu\u00e9n River]], they contribute ore than one-quarter of the total hydroelectric generation in the country. Coal is mined in the [[Rio Turbio]] area and used for electricity generation. Patagonia's notorious winds have already made the area Argentina's main source of wind power, and plans have been made for major increases in wind power generation.\nPatagonia has always been Argentina's main area, and Chile's only area, of conventional oil and gas production. Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuqu\u00e9n-Cipolleti as Patagonia's most populous urban area, and in the growth of [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], Punta Arenas, and Rio Grande, as well. The development of the Neuqu\u00e9n basin's enormous [[unconventional oil]] and gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing has just begun, but the [[YPF]]-[[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Loma Campana field in the Vaca Muerta formation is already the world's largest producing shale oil field outside North America according to former YPF CEO Miguel Gallucio.\n\n==Cuisine==\nArgentine Patagonian cuisine is largely the same as the cuisine of Buenos Aires \u2013 grilled meats and pasta \u2013 with extensive{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products that have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and ''[[centolla]]'' ([[king crab]]) are also common, though overfishing of ''centolla'' has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, a noted [[Alpine cuisine]] tradition remains, with chocolate bars and even [[fondue]] restaurants, and [[tea room]]s are a feature of the [[Welsh_people|Welsh]] communities in [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]] and [[Trevelin]], as well as in the mountains.<ref name=\"time out\"/> Since the mid-1990s, some success with winemaking has occurred in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuqu\u00e9n.\n\n==Foreign land buyers issue==\nForeign investors, including Italian multinational [[Benetton Group]], [[Ted Turner]], Joseph Lewis<ref name=\"patagonia-argentina.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/i/content/accesoalagosyrios.php |title=''Rivers of blood''from Patagonia-argentina.com}}</ref> and the environmentalist [[Douglas Tompkins]], own major land areas. This situation has caused several conflicts with local inhabitants and the governments of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], for example, the opposition by Douglas Tompkins to the planned route for [[Carretera Austral]] in [[Pumal\u00edn Park]]. A scandal is also brewing about two properties owned by Ted Turner: the ''estancia'' La Primavera, located inside [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]], and the ''estancia'' Coll\u00f3n Cura.<ref name=\"patagonia-argentina.com\"/> Benetton has faced criticism from Mapuche organizations, including [[Mapuche International Link]], over its purchase of traditional Mapuche lands in Patagonia. The Curi\u00f1anco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santarosarecuperada.com.ar/english/index.html|title=Recovered Mapuche territory in Patagonia: Benetton vs. Mapuche|publisher=MAPU Association|accessdate=7 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908191814/http://www.santarosarecuperada.com.ar/english/index.html|archivedate=8 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Llao LLao.jpg|[[Nahuel Huapi Lake]], near [[Bariloche]], Argentina [[Chait\u00e9n (volcano)|Chait\u00e9n volcano]] stretching across Patagonia into [[San Jorge Basin]] in the Atlantic Ocean\nFile:Perito Moreno Glacier - Satelite - NASA - ISS004-E-9707.JPG|Satellite view of the [[Perito Moreno Glacier]] (Santa Cruz Province) and the Andean ice sheet\nFile:Ainsworth bay and Marinelli Glacier.jpg|Ainsworth bay and [[Marinelli Glacier]], Magallanes Region, Chile\nFile:Laguna Huinfuica.jpg|Huinfiuca Lagoon, [[Villarrica National Park]], Los Lagos and Los R\u00edos regions, Chile\nFile:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], Santa Cruz Province, Argentina\nFile:Cavalli Al Pascolo Ai Piedi Del Massiccio Del Fitz Roy, Patagonia.jpg|[[Monte Fitz Roy]], Santa Cruz Province\nFile:Trelew-Chubut.jpg|The city of [[Trelew]], Chubut Province, Argentina\nFile:Guanako.jpg|[[Guanaco]]s.\nFile:Welshpeople.jpg|[[Y Wladfa|Welsh]] settlement in Patagonia, Chubut Province\nFile:southern right whale.jpg|[[Southern right whale]] in Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Chubut Province\nFile:TorredDelPaine2016.jpg|[[Torres del Paine]], Chile\nFile:Glaciar Grey, Torres del Paine.jpg|[[Grey Glacier]], [[Torres del Paine National Park]]\nFile:One of the most beautiful places on earth.
