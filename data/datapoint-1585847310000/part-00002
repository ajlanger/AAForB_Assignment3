He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become [[Marvel Comics]]' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a [[multimedia]] corporation that dominated the comics industry.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel\u2014particularly co-writer/artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]]\u2014he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes [[Spider-Man]], the [[X-Men]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Ant-Man]]. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the [[Comics Code Authority]], indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made [[cameo appearance]]s in films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he received an executive producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018.\n\nLee was inducted into the comic book industry's [[Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame]] in 1994 and the [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1995. He received the [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]]'s [[National Medal of Arts]] in 2008.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Early life===\nStanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first= John Jackson| url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays|work= [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw?url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays|archivedate=October 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> in the apartment of his [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian-born Jewish]] immigrant parents, Celia (''n\u00e9e'' Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and [[West End Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=autobio-p5 /><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZzuwrsIil0UC&q=Celia+Solomon+Lieber&dq=Celia+Solomon+Lieber |title=The Celebrity Who's Who&nbsp;\u2013 World Almanac|access-date=August 13, 2013 |isbn=978-0-345-33990-4 |date=September 1986|page=213|last1=Almanac|first1=World}}</ref> Though raised in a Jewish household, in a 2002 interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God, \"Well, let me put it this way...

I didn't even know they published comics. I was fresh out of high school, and I wanted to get into the publishing business, if I could. There was an ad in the paper that said, \"Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House.\" When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics, I figured, 'Well, I'll stay here for a little while and get some experience, and then I'll get out into the real world.' ...&nbsp;I just wanted to know, 'What do you do in a publishing company?'

They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman&nbsp;... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, 'Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?' When you're 17, what do you know? I said, 'Sure! I can do it!'

Lee recorded messages to the newly formed [[Merry Marvel Marching Society]] fan club in 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://209.51.142.186/~dogatco/mmms/mmms65.mp3 |title=Audio of Merry Marvel Marching Society record |access-date=January 30, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210075130/http://209.51.142.186/~dogatco/mmms/mmms65.mp3 |archivedate=December 10, 2005}}, including voice of Stan Lee</ref> By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 [[WBAI]] radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled \"Will Success Spoil Spiderman\" [sic].<ref name =nyt03031967>{{cite news |title=Radio |date=March 3, 1967 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F107B93C1A91788D85F438685F9 |access-date=April 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518225339/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F107B93C1A91788D85F438685F9 |archive-date=May 18, 2013 |url-status=live }} Abstract only; full article requires payment or subscription</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called \"[[Stan's Soapbox]]\", and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \"[[wikt:excelsior|Excelsior]]!\" (which is also the [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|New York state motto]]). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the \"[[Marvel Method]]\". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the [[word balloon]]s and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon.\n\nFollowing Ditko's departure from Marvel in 1966, [[John Romita Sr.]] became Lee's collaborator on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Within a year, it overtook ''Fantastic Four'' to become the company's top seller.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |first2=Peter |last2=Sanderson |title=The Marvel Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the World of Marvel |publisher=[[Running Press]] |year=2007 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=98 |isbn=978-0-7624-2844-1}}</ref> Lee and Romita's stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures.<ref>{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Matthew K. |editor-last=Gilbert |editor-first=Laura |chapter=1960s |title=Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 37|isbn = 978-0-7566-9236-0 |quote=[Stan Lee] knew that most readers tuned in every month for a glimpse of that side of Spider-Man's life as much as they did to see the wall-crawler battle the latest supervillain.}}</ref> The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 39: ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #47 (April 1967) \"Kraven's latest rematch with Spidey was set during a going-away party for Flash Thompson, who was facing the very real issue of the Vietnam War draft.\"</ref> political elections,<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 43: ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #1 (July 1968) \"Drawn by Romita and Jim Mooney, the mammoth 52-page lead story focused on corrupt politician Richard Raleigh's plot to terrorize the city.\"</ref> and [[student activism]].<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 46: ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #68 (January 1969) \"Stan Lee tackled the issues of the day again when, with artists John Romita and Jim Mooney, he dealt with social unrest at Empire State University.\"</ref> [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]], introduced in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51 (August 1967) was one of the first African-American characters in comics to play a serious supporting role.<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter David |last2=Greenberger |first2=Robert |author2-link=Robert Greenberger |title=The Spider-Man Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles Spun from Marvel's Web |publisher=[[Running Press]] |year=2010 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=[https://archive.org/details/sinatrahollywood0000knig/page/34 34] |isbn=978-0-7624-3772-6 |quote=Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson made his debut in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51, in a manner that was as quiet and unassuming as the character himself.

{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|i\u02d0|b|\u0259r}}; December 28, 1922&nbsp;\u2013 November 12, 2018) was an American [[comic book]] writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become [[Marvel Comics]]' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a [[multimedia]] corporation that dominated the comics industry.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel\u2014particularly co-writer/artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]]\u2014he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes [[Spider-Man]], the [[X-Men]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Ant-Man]]. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the [[Comics Code Authority]], indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.

To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the \"[[Marvel Method]]\". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling.

Lee stated that POW's CEO Shane Duffy and co-founder Gill Champion had presented him with what they said was a non-exclusive license for POW for him to sign, under Camsing, to use his likeness and other intellectual property; however, this contract turned out to be an exclusive license, which Lee claimed he would never have entered.
