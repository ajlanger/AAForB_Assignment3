He adopted the Latinized form \"Tycho Brahe\" ({{IPA-da|ts\u02b0yko \u02c8p\u0281a\u02d0a|lang|Da-Tycho Brahe.ogg}}; sometimes written T\u00ffcho) at around age fifteen. The name Tycho comes from [[Tyche]] ({{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7}}, meaning \"luck\" in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent: [[Fortuna]]), a [[tutelary deity]] of fortune and prosperity of [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek city cults]]. He is now generally referred to as \"Tycho\", as was common in Scandinavia in his time, rather than by his surname \"Brahe\" (a spurious appellative form of his name, ''Tycho de Brahe'', only appears much later).<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Jackson|2001}}, page 12.</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|\u0160olcov\u00e1|2005}}.</ref>}} 14 December 1546{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1601) was a Danish [[nobility|nobleman]], astronomer, and writer known for his accurate and comprehensive [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations. He was born in the then Danish peninsula of [[Scania]]. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[astrologer]], and [[alchemy|alchemist]]. He has been described as \"the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact [[empirical evidence|empirical facts]]\".<ref>[[Edwin Arthur Burtt]], ''[[wikiquote:The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science|The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science]]: A Historical and Critical Essay'' (1925).</ref> Most of his observations were more accurate than the best available observations at the time.\n\nAn heir to several of Denmark's principal noble families, Tycho received a comprehensive education. He took an interest in astronomy and in the creation of more accurate instruments of measurement. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the [[geometry|geometrical]] benefits of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] with the philosophical benefits of the [[Ptolemaic system]] into his own model of the universe, the [[Tychonic system]]. His system correctly saw the [[Moon]] as orbiting [[Earth]], and the planets as orbiting the Sun, but erroneously considered the Sun to be orbiting the Earth. Furthermore, he was the last of the major [[naked-eye]] astronomers, working without [[telescope]]s for his observations. In his ''De nova stella'' (''On the New Star'') of 1573, he refuted the [[Aristotelian physics#celestial unchanging|Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm]]. His precise measurements indicated that \"new stars\" (stellae [[nova]]e, now known as [[supernova]]e), in particular [[SN 1572|that of 1572]], lacked the [[parallax]] expected in sublunar phenomena and were therefore not tailless [[Comet#History of study|comets]] in the atmosphere as previously believed but were above the atmosphere and beyond the Moon. Using similar measurements, he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly immutable [[celestial spheres]].\n\n[[Frederick II of Denmark|King Frederick II]] granted Tycho an estate on the island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hven]] and the funding to build [[Uraniborg]], an early [[research institute]], where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later [[Stjerneborg]], underground, when he discovered that his instruments in Uraniborg were not sufficiently steady. On the island (where he behaved autocratically toward the residents) he founded manufactories, such as a [[paper mill]], to provide material for printing his results. After disagreements with the new Danish king, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], in 1597, Tycho went into exile. He was invited by the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] king and [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer. He built an observatory at [[Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou]]. There, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by [[Johannes Kepler]], who later used Tycho's astronomical data to develop his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|three laws of planetary motion]].\n\nTycho's body has been exhumed twice, in 1901 and 2010, to examine the circumstances of his death and to identify the material from which his artificial nose was made. The conclusion was that his death was likely caused by a burst bladder, and not by poisoning, as had been suggested, and that the artificial nose was more likely made of brass than silver or gold, as some had believed in his time.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Jacques de Gheyn Ii - Portrait of Tycho Brahe, astronomer (without a hat) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|1586 portrait of Tycho Brahe framed by the family shields of his noble ancestors, by [[Jacob de Gheyn II|Jacques de Gheyn]].]]\nTycho Brahe was born as heir to several of Denmark's most influential noble families and in addition to his immediate ancestry with the [[Brahe]] and the [[Bille (noble family)|Bille families]], he also counted the Rud, [[Trolle]], [[Ulfstand]], and [[Rosenkrantz (noble family)|Rosenkrantz]] families among his ancestors. Both of his grandfathers and all of his great grandfathers had served as members of the Danish king's [[Riksr\u00e5d|Privy Council]]. His paternal grandfather and namesake Thyge Brahe was the lord of [[Tosterup Castle]] in Scania and died in battle during the 1523 Siege of Malm\u00f6 during the Lutheran Reformation Wars. His maternal grandfather [[Claus Bille]], lord to [[Bohus Fortress|Bohus Castle]] and a second cousin of Swedish king [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]], participated in the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] on the side of the Danish king against the Swedish nobles. Tycho's father [[Otte Brahe]], a royal Privy Councilor (like his own father), married [[Beate Clausdatter Bille|Beate Bille]], who was herself a powerful figure at the Danish court holding several royal land titles. Both parents are buried under the floor of [[K\u00e5ger\u00f6d|K\u00e5ger\u00f6d Church]], four kilometres east of [[Knutstorp Castle|Knutstorp]].{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n===Early years===\nTycho was born at his family's ancestral seat of [[Knutstorp Castle]] (Danish: ''Knudstrup borg''; Swedish: ''Knutstorps borg''), about eight kilometres north of [[Sval\u00f6v Municipality|Sval\u00f6v]] in then Danish [[Scania]]. He was the oldest of 12 siblings, 8 of whom lived to adulthood. His twin brother died before being [[baptized]]. Tycho later wrote an ode in Latin to his dead twin,{{sfn|Wittendorff|1994|p=68}} which was printed in 1572 as his first published work. An [[epitaph]], originally from Knutstorp, but now on a plaque near the church door, shows the whole family, including Tycho as a boy.\n\nWhen he was only two years old Tycho was taken away to be raised by his uncle [[J\u00f8rgen Thygesen Brahe]] and his wife [[Inger Oxe]] (sister to [[Peder Oxe]], Steward of the Realm) who were childless. It is unclear why Otte Brahe reached this arrangement with his brother, but Tycho was the only one of his siblings not to be raised by his mother at Knutstorp. Instead, Tycho was raised at J\u00f8rgen Brahe's estate at Tosterup and at [[Tranek\u00e6r]] on the island of [[Langeland]], and later at N\u00e6sbyhoved Castle near [[Odense]], and later again at the Castle of [[Nyk\u00f8bing Falster|Nyk\u00f8bing]] on the island of [[Falster]]. Tycho later wrote that J\u00f8rgen Brahe \"raised me and generously provided for me during his life until my eighteenth year; he always treated me as his own son and made me his heir\".{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=40}}\n\nFrom ages 6 to 12, Tycho attended Latin school, probably in Nyk\u00f8bing. At age 12, on 19 April 1559, Tycho began studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. There, following his uncle's wishes, he studied law, but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in [[astronomy]]. At the University, [[Aristotle]] was a staple of scientific theory, and Tycho likely received a thorough training in [[Aristotelian physics]] and cosmology. He experienced the [[solar eclipse of August 21, 1560|solar eclipse of 21 August 1560]], and was greatly impressed by the fact that it had been predicted, although the prediction based on current observational data was a day off. He realized that more accurate observations would be the key to making more exact predictions. He purchased an [[ephemeris]] and books on astronomy, including [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]'s ''[[De sphaera mundi]]'', [[Petrus Apianus]]'s ''Cosmographia seu descriptio totius orbis'' and [[Regiomontanus]]'s ''De triangulis omnimodis''.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=40}}\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Thygesen Brahe, however, wanted Tycho to educate himself in order to become a civil servant, and sent him on a study tour of Europe in early 1562. 15-year old Tycho was given as mentor the 19-year-old [[Anders S\u00f8rensen Vedel]], whom he eventually talked into allowing the pursuit of astronomy during the tour.{{sfn|Bricka|1888|p=608}} Vedel and his pupil left Copenhagen in February 1562. On 24 March, they arrived in [[Leipzig]], where they matriculated at the Lutheran [[Leipzig University]].{{sfn|Dreyer|2004|p=16}} In 1563, he observed a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, and noticed that the Copernican and Ptolemaic tables used to predict the conjunction were inaccurate. This led him to realize that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable. He began maintaining detailed journals of all his astronomical observations. In this period, he combined the study of astronomy with [[astrology]], laying down horoscopes for different famous personalities.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=45}}\n\nWhen Tycho and Vedel returned from Leipzig in 1565, Denmark was at [[Northern Seven Years' War|war with Sweden]], and as vice-admiral of the Danish fleet, J\u00f8rgen Brahe had become a national hero for having participated in the sinking of the [[Swedish warship Mars|Swedish warship ''Mars'']] during the [[First battle of \u00d6land (1564)]]. Shortly after Tycho's arrival in Denmark, J\u00f8rgen Brahe was defeated in the [[Action of 4 June 1565]], and shortly afterwards died of a fever. Stories have it that he contracted pneumonia after a night of drinking with the Danish King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] when the king fell into the water in a Copenhagen canal and Brahe jumped in after him. Brahe's possessions passed on to his wife Inger Oxe, who considered Tycho with special fondness.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=46}}\n\n===Tycho's nose===\n[[File:Artificial nose, 17th-18th century. (9663809400).jpg|thumb|right|An artificial nose of the kind Tycho wore. This particular example did not belong to Tycho.]]\nIn 1566, Tycho left to study at the [[University of Rostock]]. Here, he studied with professors of medicine at the university's famous medical school and became interested in medical alchemy and botanical medicine.<ref>See [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/100028187 entry of Tycho Brahe] in [[Rostock Matrikelportal]].</ref> On 29 December 1566 at the age of 20, Tycho lost part of his nose in a sword [[duel]] with a fellow Danish nobleman, his third cousin [[Manderup Parsberg]]. The two had drunkenly quarreled over who was the superior mathematician at an engagement party at the home of Professor [[Lucas Bacmeister (theologian)|Lucas Bachmeister]] on 10\u00a0December.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Search for Tycho Brahe's Nose |last=Benecke |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Benecke |journal=[[Annals of Improbable Research]] |date=July\u2013August 2004 |page=6}}</ref> Coming nearly to quarrel again with his cousin on 29\u00a0December, they ended up resolving their feud with a duel in the dark. Though the two were later reconciled, the duel resulted in Tycho losing the bridge of his nose and gaining a broad scar across his forehead. He received the best possible care at the university and wore a prosthetic nose for the rest of his life. It was kept in place with [[wheatpaste|paste]] or glue and said to be made of silver and gold.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boerst |first=William J. |title=Tycho Brahe: Mapping the Heavens |year=2003 |publisher=Morgan Reynolds Publishing |isbn=978-1883846978 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781883846978/page/34 34\u201335] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781883846978/page/34}}</ref> In November 2012, Danish and Czech researchers reported that the prosthetic was actually made of [[brass]] after chemically analyzing a small bone sample from the nose from the body exhumed in 2010.<ref name=\"LS-20121116\">{{cite web |last=Gannon |first=Megan |title=Tycho Brahe Died from Pee, Not Poison |url=http://www.livescience.com/24835-astronomer-tycho-brahe-death.html |date=November 16, 2012 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=November 17, 2012 }}</ref> The prosthetics made of gold and silver were mostly worn for special occasions, rather than everyday wear.\n\n===Science and life on Uraniborg===\nIn April 1567, Tycho returned home from his travels, with a firm intention of becoming an astrologer. Although he had been expected to go into politics and the law, like most of his kinsmen, and although Denmark was still at war with Sweden, his family supported his decision to dedicate himself to the sciences. His father wanted him to take up law, but Tycho was allowed to travel to Rostock and then to [[Augsburg]] (where he built a great [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]), [[Basel]], and [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]. In 1568, he was appointed a [[canon (priest)|canon]] at the Cathedral of Roskilde, a largely honorary position that would allow him to focus on his studies. At the end of 1570, he was informed of his father's ill health, so he returned to [[Knutstorp Castle]], where his father died on 9 May 1571. The war was over, and the Danish lords soon returned to prosperity. Soon, another uncle, Steen Bille, helped him build an observatory and alchemical laboratory at [[Herrevad Abbey]].{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=8\u201314}} Tycho was acknowledged by King Frederick II who proposed to him that an observatory be built to better study the night sky. After accepting this proposal, the location for the Uraniborg's construction took place at a remote island called Hven in  the Sont near Copenhagen, which made a name for itself as the most promising observatory in Europe at the time. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/brahe.html|title=The Galileo Project {{!}} Science {{!}} Tycho Brahe|website=galileo.rice.edu|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\n====Marriage to Kirsten J\u00f8rgensdatter====\nTowards the end of 1571, Tycho fell in love with Kirsten, daughter of J\u00f8rgen Hansen, the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister in Knudstrup.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=45}} As she was a [[commoner]], Tycho never formally married her, since if he did he would lose his noble privileges. However, [[Courts of Denmark|Danish law]] permitted [[morganatic marriage]], which meant that a nobleman and a common woman could live together openly as husband and wife for three years, and their alliance then became a legally binding marriage. However, each would maintain their social status, and any children they had together would be considered commoners, with no rights to titles, landholdings, coat of arms, or even their father's noble name.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=12\u201314}} While King Frederick respected Tycho's choice of wife, himself having been unable to marry the woman he loved, many of Tycho's family members disagreed, and many churchmen would continue to hold the lack of a divinely sanctioned marriage against him. Kirsten J\u00f8rgensdatter gave birth to their first daughter, Kirstine (named after Tycho's late sister) on 12{{nbsp}}October 1573. Kirstine died from the plague in 1576, and Tycho wrote a heartfelt elegy for her tombstone.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}} In 1574, they moved to Copenhagen where their daughter Magdalene was born,{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=60}} later the family followed him into exile.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=207}} Kirsten and Tycho lived together for almost thirty years until Tycho's death.  Together, they had eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood.\n\n====The 1572 supernova====\n[[File:Tycho Cas SN1572.jpg|thumb|left|Star map of the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] showing the position of the [[SN 1572|supernova of 1572]] (the topmost star, labelled ''I''); from Tycho Brahe's ''De nova stella''.]]\nOn 11 November 1572, Tycho observed (from [[Herrevad Abbey]]) a very bright star, now numbered [[SN 1572]], which had unexpectedly appeared in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. Because it had been maintained since [[Ancient history|antiquity]] that the world beyond the Moon's orbit was eternally unchangeable (celestial immutability was a fundamental axiom of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] world-view), other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the terrestrial sphere below the Moon. However, Tycho observed that the object showed no daily [[Diurnal parallax|parallax]] against the background of the fixed stars. This implied that it was at least farther away than the Moon and those planets that do show such parallax. He also found that the object did not change its position relative to the fixed stars over several months, as all planets did in their periodic orbital motions, even the outer planets, for which no daily parallax was detectable. This suggested that it was not even a planet, but a fixed star in the stellar sphere beyond all the planets. In 1573, he published a small book ''De nova stella'',<ref>[http://www.texts.dnlb.dk/DeNovaStella/Index.html ''De nova et nullius \u00e6vi memoria prius visa stella'']. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224211014/http://www.texts.dnlb.dk/DeNovaStella/Index.html |date=2009-02-24 }} \u2013 Photocopy of the Latin print with a partial translation into Danish: \"''Om den nye og aldrig siden Verdens begyndelse i nogen tidsalders erindring f\u00f8r observerede stjerne&nbsp;...''\"</ref> thereby coining the term [[nova]] for a \"new\" star (we now classify this star as a [[supernova]] and know that it is 7500&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from Earth). This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession. Tycho was strongly critical of those who dismissed the implications of the astronomical appearance, writing in the preface to ''De nova stella'': \"''O crassa ingenia. O caecos coeli spectatores''\" (\"Oh thick wits. Oh blind watchers of the sky\"). The publication of his discovery made him a well-known name among scientists across Europe.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|pp=55\u201360}}\n\n====Lord of Hven====\n[[File:Uraniborgskiss 90.jpg|thumb|right|A hand-painted copper-plate engraving of Uraniborg from Blaeu's ''[[Atlas Maior]]'' (1662-5), based on a woodcut from Brahe's ''Astronomi\u00e6 instaurat\u00e6 mechanica'' (1598).]]\n\nTycho continued with his detailed observations, often assisted by his first assistant and student, his younger sister [[Sophia Brahe|Sophie Brahe]]. In 1574, Tycho published the observations made in 1572 from his first observatory at [[Herrevad Abbey]]. He then started lecturing on astronomy, but gave it up and left Denmark in spring 1575 to tour abroad. He first visited [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]]'s observatory at Kassel, then went on to Frankfurt, Basel and Venice, where he acted as an agent for the Danish king, contacting artisans and craftsmen whom the king wanted to work on his new palace at Elsinore. Upon his return, the King wished to repay Tycho's service by offering him a position worthy of his family; he offered him a choice of lordships of militarily and economically important estates, such as the castles of [[Hammershus]] or [[Helsingborg]]. But Tycho was reluctant to take up a position as a lord of the realm, preferring to focus on his science. He wrote to his friend Johannes Pratensis, \"I did not want to take possession of any of the castles our benevolent king so graciously offered me. I am displeased with society here, customary forms and the whole rubbish\".{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=8}} Tycho secretly began to plan to move to Basel, wishing to participate in the burgeoning academic and scientific life there. But the King heard of Tycho's plans, and desiring to keep the distinguished scientist, he offered Tycho the island of [[Hven]] in [[\u00d8resund]] and funding to set up an observatory.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=7\u20138, 25\u201327}}\n\n[[File:Tycho-Brahe-Mural-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|left|Tycho Brahe's large mural quadrant at Uraniborg]]\n\nUntil then, Hven had been property directly under the Crown, and the 50 families on the island considered themselves to be freeholding farmers, but with Tycho's appointment as Feudal Lord of Hven, this changed. Tycho took control of agricultural planning, requiring the peasants to cultivate twice as much as they had done before, and he also exacted [[corv\u00e9e]] labor from the peasants for the construction of his new castle.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=28\u201339}} The peasants complained about Tycho's excessive taxation and took him to court. The court established Tycho's right to levy taxes and labor, and the result was a contract detailing the mutual obligations of lord and peasants on the island.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=40\u201343}}\n\nTycho envisioned his castle [[Uraniborg]] as a temple dedicated to the [[muse]]s of arts and sciences, rather than as a military fortress; indeed, it was named after [[Urania]], the [[muse]] of astronomy. Construction began in 1576 (with a laboratory for his [[alchemy|alchemical]] experiments in the cellar). Uraniborg was inspired by the Venetian architect [[Andrea Palladio]], and was one of the first buildings in northern Europe to show influence from Italian renaissance architecture. When he realized that the towers of Uraniborg were not adequate as observatories because of the instruments' exposure to the elements and the movement of the building, he then constructed a second underground observatory at nearby [[Stjerneborg]] in 1581. The basement included an alchemical laboratory with 16 furnaces for conducting distillations and other chemical experiments.{{sfn|Shackelford|1993}} Unusually for the time, Tycho established Uraniborg as a research centre, where almost 100 students and artisans worked from 1576 to 1597.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=247}}<ref>{{cite web |last=West |first=Mary Lou |title=Physics Today August 2001 |url=http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-8/p47a.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050215193155/http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-8/p47a.html |archivedate=2005-02-15}}</ref> Uraniborg also contained a printing press and a paper mill, both among the first in Scandinavia, enabling Tycho to publish his own manuscripts, on locally made paper with his own [[watermark]]. He created a system of ponds and canals to run the wheels of the paper mill. Over the years he worked on Uraniborg, Tycho was assisted by a number of students and proteg\u00e9s, many of whom went on to their own careers in astronomy: among them were [[Christian S\u00f8rensen Longomontanus]], later one of the main proponents of the Tychonic model and Tycho's replacement as royal Danish astronomer; [[Peder Fleml\u00f8se]]; [[Elias Olsen Morsing]]; and [[Cort Aslakss\u00f8n]]. Tycho's instrument-maker [[Hans Crol]] also formed part of the scientific community on the island.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=142}}\n[[File:Brahe notebook.jpg|thumb|right|Brahe's notebook with his observations of the 1577 comet]]\n\nHe observed the [[Great Comet of 1577|great comet]] that was visible in the Northern sky from November 1577 to January 1578. Within Lutheranism, it was commonly believed that celestial objects like comets were powerful portents, announcing the coming apocalypse, and in addition to Tycho's observations several Danish amateur astronomers observed the object and published prophesies of impending doom. He was able to determine that the comet's distance to Earth was much greater than the distance of the Moon, so that the comet could not have originated in the \"earthly sphere\", confirming his prior anti-Aristotelian conclusions about the fixed nature of the sky beyond the Moon. He also realized that the comet's [[Comet tail|tail]] was always pointing away from the Sun. He calculated its diameter, mass, and the length of its tail, and speculated about the material it was made of. At this point, he had not yet broken with Copernican theory, and observing the comet inspired him to try to develop an alternative Copernican model in which the Earth was immobile.{{sfn|Christianson|1979}} The second half of his manuscript about the comet dealt with the astrological and apocalyptic aspects of the comet, and he rejected the prophesies of his competitors; instead, making his own predictions of dire political events in the near future.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2004}} Among his predictions was bloodshed in Moscow and the imminent fall of [[Ivan the Terrible]] by 1583.{{efn|Ivan the Terrible died a year later than predicted by Tycho Brahe.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Christianson|1979}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Tycho_Brahe%27s_Stjerneborg.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the above ground parts of Tycho Brahe's underground observatory \"Stjerneborg\".]]\nThe support that Tycho received from the Crown was substantial, amounting to 1% of the annual total revenue at one point in the 1580s.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=188}} Tycho often held large social gatherings in his castle. [[Pierre Gassendi]] wrote that Tycho also had a tame [[Moose|elk]] (moose) and that his mentor the [[Landgrave]] [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (Hesse-Cassel) asked whether there was an animal faster than a deer. Tycho replied that there was none, but he could send his tame elk.

At the beginning of each year, he had to present an Almanac to the court, predicting the influence of the stars on the political and economic prospects of the year. And at the birth of each prince, he prepared their horoscopes, predicting their fates. He also worked as a cartographer with his former tutor Anders S\u00f8rensen Vedel on mapping out all of the Danish realm.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=62}} An ally of the king and friendly with [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Queen Sophie]] (both his mother Beate Bille and adoptive mother Inger Oxe had been her court maids), he secured a promise from the King that ownership of Hven and Uraniborg would pass to his heirs.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=141}}\n\n====Publications, correspondence and scientific disputes====\n[[File:Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to the 1610<!--The date indicated in the Wikicommons file says \"1609\", but the cover of the book itself says \"1610\".--> edition of ''Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata'']]\nIn 1588, Tycho's royal benefactor died, and a volume of Tycho's great two-volume work ''Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata'' (''Introduction to the New Astronomy'') was published. The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations of 1572\u20133 involved much research to correct the stars' positions for refraction, precession, the motion of the Sun etc., and was not completed in Tycho's lifetime (it was published in Prague in 1602/03), but the second volume, titled ''De Mundi Aetherei Recentioribus Phaenomenis Liber Secundus'' (''Second Book About Recent Phenomena in the Celestial World'') and devoted to the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations, it included an account of Tycho's system of the world.{{sfn|Christianson|1979}} The third volume was intended to treat the comets of 1580 and following years in a similar manner, but it was never published, nor even written, though a great deal of material about the comet of 1585 was put together and first published in 1845 with the observations of this comet.<ref>[[John Louis Emil Dreyer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fqBCAAAAIAAJ& ''Tycho Brahe: a Picture of Scientific Life and Work in the Sixteenth Century''], A. & C.

Thus, his correspondence was crucial to his research. Often, correspondence was not just private communication between scholars, but also a way to disseminate results and arguments and to build progress and scientific consensus. Through correspondence, Tycho was involved in several personal disputes with critics of his theories. Prominent among them were [[John Craig (physician)|John Craig]], a Scottish physician who was a strong believer in the authority of the Aristotelian worldview, and [[Nicolaus Reimers|Nicolaus Reimers Baer]], known as Ursus, an astronomer at the Imperial court in Prague, whom Tycho accused of having plagiarized his cosmological model. Craig refused to accept Tycho's conclusion that the comet of 1577 had to be located within the aetherial sphere rather than within the atmosphere of Earth. Craig tried to contradict Tycho by using his own observations of the comet, and by questioning his methodology. Tycho published an ''apologia'' (a defense) of his conclusions, in which he provided additional arguments, as well as condemning Craig's ideas in strong language for being incompetent. Another dispute concerned the mathematician [[Paul Wittich]], who, after staying on Hven in 1580, taught Count Wilhelm of Kassel and his astronomer [[Christoph Rothmann]] to build copies of Tycho's instruments without permission from Tycho. In turn, Craig, who had studied with Wittich, accused Tycho of minimizing Wittich's role in developing some of the trigonometric methods used by Tycho. In his dealings with these disputes, Tycho made sure to leverage his support in the scientific community, by publishing and disseminating his own answers and arguments.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|pp=179\u201389}}\n\n===Exile and later years===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''Denmark what is my offense?

A regency council was appointed to rule for the young prince-elect until his coronation in 1596. The head of the council (Steward of the Realm) was [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], who disliked Tycho after a conflict between them, and hence Tycho's influence at the Danish court steadily declined. Feeling that his legacy on Hven was in peril, he approached the [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Dowager Queen Sophie]] and asked her to affirm in writing her late husband's promise to endow Hven to Tycho's heirs.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=141}} Nonetheless, he realized that the young king was more interested in war than in science, and was of no mind to keep his father's promise. King Christian IV followed a policy of curbing the power of the nobility by confiscating their estates to minimize their income bases, by accusing nobles of misusing their offices and of heresies against the Lutheran church. Tycho, who was known to sympathize with the [[Philippists]] (followers of [[Philip Melanchthon]]), was among the nobles who fell out of grace with the new king. The king's unfavorable disposition towards Tycho was likely also a result of efforts by several of his enemies at court to turn the king against him. Tycho's enemies included, in addition to Valkendorff, the king's doctor Peter Severinus, who also had personal gripes with Tycho, and several [[gnesio-Lutheran]] Bishops who suspected Tycho of heresy \u2014 a suspicion motivated by his known Philippist sympathies, his pursuits in medicine and alchemy (both of which he practiced without the church's approval) and his prohibiting the local priest on Hven to include the exorcism in the baptismal ritual. Among the accusations raised against Tycho were his failure to adequately maintain the royal chapel at Roskilde, and his harshness and exploitation of the Hven peasantry.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}}\n\nTycho became even more inclined to leave when a mob of commoners, possibly incited by his enemies at court, rioted in front of his house in Copenhagen. Tycho left Hven in 1597, bringing some of his instruments with him to Copenhagen, and entrusting others to a caretaker on the island. Shortly before leaving, he completed his star catalogue giving the positions of 1,000 stars.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}} After some unsuccessful attempts at influencing the king to let him return; including showcasing his instruments on the wall of the city, he finally acquiesced to exile, but he wrote his most famous poem ''Elegy to Dania'' in which he chided Denmark for not appreciating his genius.

Tycho built a new observatory in a castle in [[Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou]], 50&nbsp;km from Prague, and worked there for one year. The emperor then brought him back to Prague, where he stayed until his death. At the imperial court even Tycho's wife and children were treated like nobility, which they had never been at the Danish court.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=68}}\n\nTycho received financial support from several nobles in addition to the emperor, including Oldrich Desiderius Pruskowsky von Pruskow, to whom he dedicated his famous ''Mechanica''. In return for their support, Tycho's duties included preparing [[astrological chart]]s and predictions for his patrons at events such as births, [[weather forecasting]], and astrological interpretations of significant astronomical events, such as the [[SN 1572|supernova of 1572]] (sometimes called Tycho's supernova) and the [[Great Comet of 1577]].<ref>Adam Mosley and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science of the [[University of Cambridge]].

Kepler had previously spoken highly of Ursus, but now found himself in the problematic position of being employed by Tycho and having to defend his employer against Ursus' accusations, even though he disagreed with both of their planetary models. In 1600, he finished the tract ''Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum'' (defense of Tycho against Ursus).{{sfn|Jardine|2006}}{{sfn|Mosley|2007|p=28}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2002}} Kepler had great respect for Tycho's methods and the accuracy of his observations and considered him to be the new [[Hipparchus]], who would provide the foundation for a restoration of the science of astronomy.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=304}}\n\n===Illness, death, and investigations===\n[[File:Tycho Brahe Grave DSCN2900.jpg|thumb|Tycho Brahe's grave in Prague, new tomb stone from 1901]]\nTycho suddenly contracted a bladder or kidney ailment after attending a banquet in Prague, and died eleven days later, on 24 October 1601, at the age of 54.

Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a [[telescope]], soon to be turned skyward by [[Galileo Galilei]] and others. Given the limitations of the naked eye for making accurate observations, he devoted many of his efforts to improving the accuracy of the existing types of instrument \u2014 the [[sextant]] and the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. He designed larger versions of these instruments, which allowed him to achieve much higher accuracy. Because of the accuracy of his instruments, he quickly realized the influence of wind and the movement of buildings, and instead opted to mount his instruments underground directly on the bedrock.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=83}}\n\nTycho's observations of [[star|stellar]] and [[planet]]ary positions were noteworthy both for their accuracy and quantity.{{sfn|Swerdlow|1996|pp=207\u2013210}} With an accuracy approaching one arcminute, his celestial positions were much more accurate than those of any predecessor or contemporary \u2014 about five times as accurate as the observations of the contemporary astronomer [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm of Hesse]].{{sfn|H\u00f8g|2009}} {{harvcoltxt|Rawlins|1993|p=\u00a7B2}} asserts of Tycho's Star Catalog D, \"In it, Tycho achieved, on a mass scale, a precision far beyond that of earlier catalogers.

But, in fact, many of the stellar positions in his star catalogues were less accurate than that. The median errors for the stellar positions in his final published catalog were about 1.5', indicating that only half of the entries were more accurate than that, with an overall mean error in each coordinate of around 2'.{{sfn|Rawlins|1993|p=12}} Although the stellar observations as recorded in his observational logs were more accurate, varying from 32.3\" to 48.8\" for different instruments,{{sfn|Wesley|1978|pp=42\u201353, table 4.}} systematic errors of as much as 3' were introduced into some of the stellar positions Tycho published in his star catalog \u2014 due, for instance, to his application of an erroneous ancient value of parallax and his neglect of polestar refraction.{{sfn|Rawlins|1993|p=20, n. 70}} Incorrect transcription in the final published star catalogue, by scribes in Tycho's employ, was the source of even larger errors, sometimes by many degrees.{{efn|Victor Thoren<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Thoren|1989}}</ref> says: \"[the accuracy of the 777 star catalogue C] falls below the standards Tycho maintained for his other activities&nbsp;... the catalogue left the best qualified appraiser of it (Tycho's eminent biographer J. L. E. Dreyer) manifestly disappointed. Some 6% of its final 777 positions have errors in one or both co-ordinates that can only have arisen from 'handling' problems of one kind or another. And while the brightest stars were generally placed with the minute-of-arc accuracy Tycho expected to achieve in every aspect of his work, the fainter stars (for which the slits on his sights had to be widened, and the sharpness of their alignment reduced) were considerably less well located.\" (ii) M. Hoskin<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Hoskin|1999}}, p. 101</ref> concurs with Thoren's finding \"Yet although the places of the brightest of the non-reference stars [in the 777 star catalogue] are mostly correct to around the minute of arc that was his standard, the fainter stars are less accurately located, and there are many errors.\" (iii) The greatest max errors are given by Dennis Rawlins.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Rawlins|1993}}, p. 42</ref> They are in descending order a 238\u00b0 scribal error in the right ascension of star D723; a 36\u00b0 scribal error in the right ascension of D811; a 23\u00b0 latitude error in all 188 southern stars by virtue of a scribal error; a 20\u00b0 scribal error in longitude of D429; and a 13.5\u00b0 error in the latitude of D811.}}\n\nCelestial objects observed near the horizon and above appear with a greater [[altitude]] than the real one, due to atmospheric [[refraction]], and one of Tycho's most important innovations was that he worked out and published the very first tables for the systematic correction of this possible source of error. But, as advanced as they were, they attributed no refraction whatever above 45\u00b0 altitude for solar refraction, and none for starlight above 20\u00b0 altitude.{{sfn|Thoren|1989|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nTo perform the huge number of multiplications needed to produce much of his astronomical data, Tycho relied heavily on the then-new technique of ''[[prosthaphaeresis]]'', an algorithm for approximating products based on [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]] that predated logarithms.{{sfn|Thoren|1988}}\n\n===The Tychonic cosmological model===\n{{Main article|Tychonic system}}\n[[File:Tychonian system.svg|thumb|left|In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around the Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars.]]\n\nAlthough Tycho admired Copernicus and was the first to teach his theory in Denmark, he was unable to reconcile Copernican theory with the basic laws of [[Aristotelian physics]], that he considered to be foundational. He was also critical of the observational data that Copernicus built his theory on, which he correctly considered to have a high margin of error. Instead, Tycho proposed a \"geo-heliocentric\" system in which the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, while the other planets orbited the Sun. Tycho's system had many of the same observational and computational advantages that Copernicus' system had, and both systems also could accommodate the phases of Venus, although Galilei had yet to discover them. Tycho's system provided a safe position for astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models but were reluctant to accept the heliocentrism and the Earth's motion.{{sfn|Hetherington|Hetherington|2009|p=134}} It gained a considerable following after 1616 when Rome declared that the heliocentric model was contrary to both philosophy and Scripture, and could be discussed only as a computational convenience that had no connection to fact.{{sfn|Russell|1989}} Tycho's system also offered a major innovation: while both the purely [[geocentric model]] and the heliocentric model as set forth by Copernicus relied on the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits, Tycho eliminated the spheres entirely. Kepler, as well as other Copernican astronomers, tried to persuade Tycho to adopt the heliocentric model of the [[Solar System]], but he was not persuaded. According to Tycho, the idea of a rotating and revolving Earth would be \"in violation not only of all physical truth but also of the authority of Holy Scripture, which ought to be paramount.\"{{sfn|Repcheck|2008|p=187}}\n\nWith respect to physics, Tycho held that the Earth was just too sluggish and heavy to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens (whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending) were made of [[Aether (classical element)|\"Aether\" or \"Quintessence\"]]; this substance, not found on Earth, was light, strong, unchanging, and its natural state was circular motion. By contrast, the Earth (where objects seem to have motion only when moved) and things on it were composed of substances that were heavy and whose natural state was rest. Accordingly, Tycho said the Earth was a \"lazy\" body that was not readily moved.{{sfn|Blair|1990|pp=361\u2013362}}{{sfn|Moesgaard|1972|p=40}}{{sfn|Gingerich|1973|p=87}} Thus while Tycho acknowledged that the daily rising and setting of the Sun and stars could be explained by the Earth's rotation, as Copernicus had said, still <blockquote>such a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Blair|1990}}, page 361.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nWith respect to the stars, Tycho also believed that, if the Earth orbited the Sun annually, there should be an observable [[stellar parallax]] over any period of six months, during which the angular orientation of a given star would change thanks to Earth's changing position. (This parallax does exist, but is so small it was not detected until 1838, when [[Friedrich Bessel]] discovered a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of the star [[61 Cygni]].<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bessel.html Bessel biography]. [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 2008-09-28</ref>) The Copernican explanation for this lack of parallax was that the stars were such a great distance from Earth that Earth's orbit was almost insignificant by comparison. However, Tycho noted that this explanation introduced another problem: Stars as seen by the naked eye appear small, but of some size, with more prominent stars such as [[Vega]] appearing larger than lesser stars such as [[Polaris]], which in turn appear larger than many others. Tycho had determined that a typical star measured approximately a minute of arc in size, with more prominent ones being two or three times as large. In writing to [[Christoph Rothmann]], a Copernican astronomer, Tycho used basic geometry to show that, assuming a small parallax that just escaped detection, the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the Sun to Saturn. Moreover, the only way the stars could be so distant and still appear the sizes they do in the sky would be if even average stars were gigantic \u2014 at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the Sun. And, Tycho said, the more prominent stars would have to be even larger still. And what if the parallax was even smaller than anyone thought, so the stars were yet more distant? Then they would all have to be even larger still.{{sfn|Blair|1990|p=364}}{{sfn|Moesgaard|1972|p=51}} Tycho said<blockquote>Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Blair|1990}}, page 364.</ref></blockquote> Copernicans offered a religious response to Tycho's geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if He wanted.{{sfn|Moesgaard|1972|p=52}}{{sfn|Vermij|2007|pp=124\u2013125}} In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho's by saying: <blockquote>\"[W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from here anything of the absurd. These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand. Grant the vastness of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be as great as you like \u2014 these will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator. It reckons that the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his majesty. So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?\".{{sfn|Graney|2012|p=217}}</blockquote>\n\nReligion played a role in Tycho's geocentrism also \u2013 he cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest. He rarely used Biblical arguments alone (to him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth's motion) and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously.{{sfn|Blair|1990|pp=362\u2013364}}\n\nTycho's 1587 geo-heliocentric model differed from those of other geo-heliocentric astronomers, such as [[Paul Wittich]], [[Reimarus Ursus]], [[Helisaeus Roeslin]] and [[David Origanus]], in that the orbits of Mars and the Sun intersected. This was because Tycho had come to believe the distance of Mars from the Earth at opposition (that is, when Mars is on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun) was less than that of the Sun from the Earth. Tycho believed this because he came to believe Mars had a greater daily parallax than the Sun. But, in 1584, in a letter to a fellow astronomer, Brucaeus, he had claimed that Mars had been further than the Sun at the opposition of 1582, because he had observed that Mars had little or no daily parallax. He said he had therefore rejected Copernicus's model because it predicted Mars would be at only two-thirds the distance of the Sun.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dreyer|1890}}, p 178\u2013180</ref> But, he apparently later changed his mind to the opinion that Mars at opposition was indeed nearer the Earth than the Sun was, but apparently without any valid observational evidence in any discernible Martian parallax.<ref>{{citation |last1= Gingerich |last2= Westman |title= The Wittich Connection |year= 1988 |page= 171}}</ref> Such intersecting Martian and solar orbits meant that there could be no solid rotating celestial spheres, because they could not possibly interpenetrate. Arguably, this conclusion was independently supported by the conclusion that the comet of 1577 was superlunary, because it showed less daily parallax than the Moon and thus must pass through any celestial spheres in its transit.\n\n===Lunar theory===\nTycho's distinctive contributions to [[lunar theory]] include his discovery of the [[variation (astronomy)|variation]] of the Moon's longitude. This represents the largest inequality of longitude after the [[equation of the center]] and the [[evection]]. He also discovered librations in the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit, relative to the ecliptic (which is not a constant of about 5\u00b0 as had been believed before him, but fluctuates through a range of over a quarter of a degree), and accompanying oscillations in the longitude of the [[lunar node]]. These represent perturbations in the Moon's ecliptic latitude. Tycho's lunar theory doubled the number of distinct lunar inequalities, relative to those anciently known, and reduced the discrepancies of lunar theory to about a fifth of their previous amounts. It was published posthumously by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] in 1602, and Kepler's own derivative form appears in Kepler's ''Rudolphine Tables'' of 1627.{{sfn|Thoren|1967}}\n\n===Subsequent developments in astronomy ===\nKepler used Tycho's records of the motion of Mars to deduce [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]],{{sfn|Stephenson|1987|pp=22, 39, 51, 204}} enabling calculation of astronomical tables with unprecedented accuracy (the ''Rudolphine Tables''){{efn|According to Owen Gingerich<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Gingerich|1989}}, page 77</ref> and Christopher Linton,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Linton|2004}}, page 224</ref> these tables were some 30 times more accurate than other astronomical tables then available.}} and providing powerful support for a [[heliocentric]] model of the [[solar system]].{{sfn|Swerdlow|2004|p=96}}{{sfn|Stephenson|1987|pp=67\u201368}}\n[[File:Naboth Capella.JPG|thumb|[[Valentin Naboth]]'s drawing of [[Martianus Capella]]'s geo-heliocentric astronomical model (1573)]]\n\n[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s 1610 telescopic discovery that Venus shows a full set of phases refuted the pure geocentric Ptolemaic model. After that it seems 17th-century astronomy mostly converted to geo-heliocentric planetary models that could explain these phases just as well as the heliocentric model could, but without the latter's disadvantage of the failure to detect any annual [[stellar parallax]] that Tycho and others regarded as refuting it.{{sfn|Taton|Wilson|1989}} The three main geo-heliocentric models were the Tychonic, the Capellan with just Mercury and Venus orbiting the Sun such as favoured by [[Francis Bacon]], for example, and the extended Capellan model of [[Riccioli]] with Mars also orbiting the Sun whilst Saturn and Jupiter orbit the fixed Earth. But the Tychonic model was probably the most popular, albeit probably in what was known as 'the semi-Tychonic' version with a daily rotating Earth. This model was advocated by Tycho's ex-assistant and disciple [[Longomontanus]] in his 1622 ''Astronomia Danica'' that was the intended completion of Tycho's planetary model with his observational data, and which was regarded as the canonical statement of the complete Tychonic planetary system. Longomontanus' work was published in several editions and used by many subsequent astronomers, and through him the Tychonic system was adopted by astronomers as far away as China.{{sfn|Hashimoto|1987}}\n\n[[File:Libr0309.jpg|thumb|Johannes Kepler published the ''Rudolphine Tables'' containing a star catalog and planetary tables using Tycho's measurements.

Among pro-Tycho Jesuits, Ignace Pardies declared in 1691 that it was still the commonly accepted system, and Francesco Blanchinus reiterated that as late as 1728.{{sfn|Schofield|1989|p=41}} Persistence of the Tychonic system, especially in Catholic countries, has been attributed to its satisfaction of a need (relative to Catholic doctrine) for \"a safe synthesis of ancient and modern\". After 1670, even many Jesuit writers only thinly disguised their Copernicanism. But in Germany, the Netherlands, and England, the Tychonic system \"vanished from the literature much earlier\".{{sfn|Schofield|1989|p=43}}\n\n[[James Bradley]]'s discovery of [[stellar aberration]], published in 1729, eventually gave direct evidence excluding the possibility of all forms of geocentrism including Tycho's. Stellar aberration could only be satisfactorily explained on the basis that the Earth is in annual orbit around the Sun, with an orbital velocity that combines with the finite speed of the light coming from an observed star or planet, to affect the apparent direction of the body observed.{{sfn|Wilson|1989|p=205}}\n\n===Work in medicine, alchemy and astrology===\nTycho also worked in medicine and alchemy. He was strongly influenced by Paracelsus, who considered the human body to be directly influenced by celestial bodies. The paracelsian view of man as a microcosm, and astrology as the science tying together the celestial and bodily universes was also shared by Philip Melanchthon, and was precisely one of the points of contention between Melanchthon and Luther, and hence between the philippists and the gnesio-Lutherans.{{sfn|Christianson|1979}} For Tycho there was a close connection between empiricism and natural science on one hand and religion and astrology on the other.{{sfn|Alm\u00e1si|2013}} Using his large herbal garden at Uraniborg, Tycho produced several recipes for herbal medicines, using them to treat illnesses such as fever and plague.{{sfn|Figala|1972}} In his own time, Tycho was also famous for his contributions to medicine; his herbal medicines were in use as late as the 1900s.{{sfn|Kragh|2005|p=243}} The expression [[Tycho Brahe days]], in Scandinavian folklore, refers to a number of \"unlucky days\" that were featured in many almanacs beginning in the 1700s, but which have no direct connection to Tycho or his work.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=215}} Whether because he realized that astrology was not an empirical science or because he feared religious repercussions Tycho seems to have had a somewhat ambiguous relation to his own astrological work. For example, two of his more astrological treatises, one on weather predictions and an almanac, were published in the names of his assistants, in spite of the fact that he worked on them personally. Some scholars have argued that he lost faith in horoscope astrology over the course of his career,{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=215\u2013216}} and others that he simply changed his public communication on the topic as he realized that connections with astrology could influence the reception of his empirical astronomical work.{{sfn|Alm\u00e1si|2013}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Brahe kepler.jpg|thumb|Monument of Tycho Brahe and [[Johannes Kepler]] in [[Prague]]]]\n\n===Biographies===\nThe first biography of Tycho, which was also the first full-length biography of any scientist, was written by [[Pierre Gassendi]] in 1654.{{sfn|Kragh|2007|p=122}} In 1779, Tycho de Hoffmann wrote of Tycho's life in his history of the Brahe family. In 1913, Dreyer published Tycho's collected works, facilitating further research. Early modern scholarship on Tycho tended to see the shortcomings of his astronomical model, painting him as a mysticist recalcitrant in accepting the Copernican revolution, and valuing mostly his observations that allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of planetary movement. Especially in Danish scholarship, Tycho was depicted as a mediocre scholar and a traitor to the nation \u2014 perhaps because of the important role in Danish historiography of Christian IV as a warrior king.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}} In the second half of the 20th century, scholars began reevaluating is significance and studies by Kristian Peder Moesgaard, Owen Gingerich, Robert Westman, Victor E. Thoren, and John R. Christianson focused on his contributions to science, and demonstrated that while he admired Copernicus he was simply unable to reconcile his basic theory of physics with the Copernican view.{{sfn|Christianson|2002}}{{sfn|Christianson|1998}} Christianson's work showed the influence of Tycho's Uraniborg as a training center for scientists who after studying with Tycho went on to make contributions in various scientific fields.{{sfn|Kragh|2007}}\n\n===Scientific legacy===\nAlthough Tycho's planetary model was soon discredited, his astronomical observations were an essential contribution to the [[scientific revolution]]. The traditional view of Tycho is that he was primarily an empiricist who set new standards for precise and objective measurements.{{sfn|Kragh|2005|pages=220\u201322}} This appraisal originated in [[Pierre Gassendi]]'s 1654 biography, ''Tychonis Brahe, equitis Dani, astronomorum coryphaei, vita''. It was furthered by [[Johann Dreyer]]'s biography in 1890, which was long the most influential work on Tycho. According to historian of science Helge Kragh, this assessment grew out of Gassendi's opposition to [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Cartesianism]], and fails to account for the diversity of Tycho's activities.{{sfn|Kragh|2005|pages=220\u201322}}\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nTycho's discovery of the new star was the inspiration for [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"[[Al Aaraaf]]\".<ref name=\"Hallqvist2006\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.poedecoder.com/qrisse/bio/westpoint.php\n | title = Al Aaraaf and West Point\n | series = Qrisse's Edgar Allan Poe Pages\n | date = 7 February 2006\n | last1 = Hallqvist\n | first1 = Christoffer\n}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine published an article by Donald W.

The name Tycho comes from [[Tyche]] ({{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7}}, meaning \"luck\" in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent: [[Fortuna]]), a [[tutelary deity]] of fortune and prosperity of [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek city cults]]. He is now generally referred to as \"Tycho\", as was common in Scandinavia in his time, rather than by his surname \"Brahe\" (a spurious appellative form of his name, ''Tycho de Brahe'', only appears much later).<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Jackson|2001}}, page 12.</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|\u0160olcov\u00e1|2005}}.</ref>}} 14 December 1546{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1601) was a Danish [[nobility|nobleman]], astronomer, and writer known for his accurate and comprehensive [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations. He was born in the then Danish peninsula of [[Scania]]. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[astrologer]], and [[alchemy|alchemist]]. He has been described as \"the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact [[empirical evidence|empirical facts]]\".<ref>[[Edwin Arthur Burtt]], ''[[wikiquote:The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science|The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science]]: A Historical and Critical Essay'' (1925).</ref> Most of his observations were more accurate than the best available observations at the time.\n\nAn heir to several of Denmark's principal noble families, Tycho received a comprehensive education. He took an interest in astronomy and in the creation of more accurate instruments of measurement. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the [[geometry|geometrical]] benefits of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] with the philosophical benefits of the [[Ptolemaic system]] into his own model of the universe, the [[Tychonic system]]. His system correctly saw the [[Moon]] as orbiting [[Earth]], and the planets as orbiting the Sun, but erroneously considered the Sun to be orbiting the Earth. Furthermore, he was the last of the major [[naked-eye]] astronomers, working without [[telescope]]s for his observations. In his ''De nova stella'' (''On the New Star'') of 1573, he refuted the [[Aristotelian physics#celestial unchanging|Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm]]. His precise measurements indicated that \"new stars\" (stellae [[nova]]e, now known as [[supernova]]e), in particular [[SN 1572|that of 1572]], lacked the [[parallax]] expected in sublunar phenomena and were therefore not tailless [[Comet#History of study|comets]] in the atmosphere as previously believed but were above the atmosphere and beyond the Moon. Using similar measurements, he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly immutable [[celestial spheres]].\n\n[[Frederick II of Denmark|King Frederick II]] granted Tycho an estate on the island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hven]] and the funding to build [[Uraniborg]], an early [[research institute]], where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later [[Stjerneborg]], underground, when he discovered that his instruments in Uraniborg were not sufficiently steady. On the island (where he behaved autocratically toward the residents) he founded manufactories, such as a [[paper mill]], to provide material for printing his results. After disagreements with the new Danish king, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], in 1597, Tycho went into exile. He was invited by the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] king and [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer. He built an observatory at [[Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou]]. There, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by [[Johannes Kepler]], who later used Tycho's astronomical data to develop his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|three laws of planetary motion]].\n\nTycho's body has been exhumed twice, in 1901 and 2010, to examine the circumstances of his death and to identify the material from which his artificial nose was made. The conclusion was that his death was likely caused by a burst bladder, and not by poisoning, as had been suggested, and that the artificial nose was more likely made of brass than silver or gold, as some had believed in his time.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Jacques de Gheyn Ii - Portrait of Tycho Brahe, astronomer (without a hat) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|1586 portrait of Tycho Brahe framed by the family shields of his noble ancestors, by [[Jacob de Gheyn II|Jacques de Gheyn]].]]\nTycho Brahe was born as heir to several of Denmark's most influential noble families and in addition to his immediate ancestry with the [[Brahe]] and the [[Bille (noble family)|Bille families]], he also counted the Rud, [[Trolle]], [[Ulfstand]], and [[Rosenkrantz (noble family)|Rosenkrantz]] families among his ancestors. Both of his grandfathers and all of his great grandfathers had served as members of the Danish king's [[Riksr\u00e5d|Privy Council]]. His paternal grandfather and namesake Thyge Brahe was the lord of [[Tosterup Castle]] in Scania and died in battle during the 1523 Siege of Malm\u00f6 during the Lutheran Reformation Wars. His maternal grandfather [[Claus Bille]], lord to [[Bohus Fortress|Bohus Castle]] and a second cousin of Swedish king [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]], participated in the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] on the side of the Danish king against the Swedish nobles. Tycho's father [[Otte Brahe]], a royal Privy Councilor (like his own father), married [[Beate Clausdatter Bille|Beate Bille]], who was herself a powerful figure at the Danish court holding several royal land titles. Both parents are buried under the floor of [[K\u00e5ger\u00f6d|K\u00e5ger\u00f6d Church]], four kilometres east of [[Knutstorp Castle|Knutstorp]].{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n===Early years===\nTycho was born at his family's ancestral seat of [[Knutstorp Castle]] (Danish: ''Knudstrup borg''; Swedish: ''Knutstorps borg''), about eight kilometres north of [[Sval\u00f6v Municipality|Sval\u00f6v]] in then Danish [[Scania]]. He was the oldest of 12 siblings, 8 of whom lived to adulthood. His twin brother died before being [[baptized]]. Tycho later wrote an ode in Latin to his dead twin,{{sfn|Wittendorff|1994|p=68}} which was printed in 1572 as his first published work. An [[epitaph]], originally from Knutstorp, but now on a plaque near the church door, shows the whole family, including Tycho as a boy.\n\nWhen he was only two years old Tycho was taken away to be raised by his uncle [[J\u00f8rgen Thygesen Brahe]] and his wife [[Inger Oxe]] (sister to [[Peder Oxe]], Steward of the Realm) who were childless. It is unclear why Otte Brahe reached this arrangement with his brother, but Tycho was the only one of his siblings not to be raised by his mother at Knutstorp. Instead, Tycho was raised at J\u00f8rgen Brahe's estate at Tosterup and at [[Tranek\u00e6r]] on the island of [[Langeland]], and later at N\u00e6sbyhoved Castle near [[Odense]], and later again at the Castle of [[Nyk\u00f8bing Falster|Nyk\u00f8bing]] on the island of [[Falster]]. Tycho later wrote that J\u00f8rgen Brahe \"raised me and generously provided for me during his life until my eighteenth year; he always treated me as his own son and made me his heir\".{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=40}}\n\nFrom ages 6 to 12, Tycho attended Latin school, probably in Nyk\u00f8bing. At age 12, on 19 April 1559, Tycho began studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. There, following his uncle's wishes, he studied law, but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in [[astronomy]]. At the University, [[Aristotle]] was a staple of scientific theory, and Tycho likely received a thorough training in [[Aristotelian physics]] and cosmology. He experienced the [[solar eclipse of August 21, 1560|solar eclipse of 21 August 1560]], and was greatly impressed by the fact that it had been predicted, although the prediction based on current observational data was a day off. He realized that more accurate observations would be the key to making more exact predictions. He purchased an [[ephemeris]] and books on astronomy, including [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]'s ''[[De sphaera mundi]]'', [[Petrus Apianus]]'s ''Cosmographia seu descriptio totius orbis'' and [[Regiomontanus]]'s ''De triangulis omnimodis''.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=40}}\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Thygesen Brahe, however, wanted Tycho to educate himself in order to become a civil servant, and sent him on a study tour of Europe in early 1562. 15-year old Tycho was given as mentor the 19-year-old [[Anders S\u00f8rensen Vedel]], whom he eventually talked into allowing the pursuit of astronomy during the tour.{{sfn|Bricka|1888|p=608}} Vedel and his pupil left Copenhagen in February 1562. On 24 March, they arrived in [[Leipzig]], where they matriculated at the Lutheran [[Leipzig University]].{{sfn|Dreyer|2004|p=16}} In 1563, he observed a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, and noticed that the Copernican and Ptolemaic tables used to predict the conjunction were inaccurate. This led him to realize that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable. He began maintaining detailed journals of all his astronomical observations. In this period, he combined the study of astronomy with [[astrology]], laying down horoscopes for different famous personalities.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=45}}\n\nWhen Tycho and Vedel returned from Leipzig in 1565, Denmark was at [[Northern Seven Years' War|war with Sweden]], and as vice-admiral of the Danish fleet, J\u00f8rgen Brahe had become a national hero for having participated in the sinking of the [[Swedish warship Mars|Swedish warship ''Mars'']] during the [[First battle of \u00d6land (1564)]]. Shortly after Tycho's arrival in Denmark, J\u00f8rgen Brahe was defeated in the [[Action of 4 June 1565]], and shortly afterwards died of a fever. Stories have it that he contracted pneumonia after a night of drinking with the Danish King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] when the king fell into the water in a Copenhagen canal and Brahe jumped in after him. Brahe's possessions passed on to his wife Inger Oxe, who considered Tycho with special fondness.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=46}}\n\n===Tycho's nose===\n[[File:Artificial nose, 17th-18th century.

Although he had been expected to go into politics and the law, like most of his kinsmen, and although Denmark was still at war with Sweden, his family supported his decision to dedicate himself to the sciences. His father wanted him to take up law, but Tycho was allowed to travel to Rostock and then to [[Augsburg]] (where he built a great [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]), [[Basel]], and [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]. In 1568, he was appointed a [[canon (priest)|canon]] at the Cathedral of Roskilde, a largely honorary position that would allow him to focus on his studies. At the end of 1570, he was informed of his father's ill health, so he returned to [[Knutstorp Castle]], where his father died on 9 May 1571. The war was over, and the Danish lords soon returned to prosperity. Soon, another uncle, Steen Bille, helped him build an observatory and alchemical laboratory at [[Herrevad Abbey]].{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=8\u201314}} Tycho was acknowledged by King Frederick II who proposed to him that an observatory be built to better study the night sky. After accepting this proposal, the location for the Uraniborg's construction took place at a remote island called Hven in  the Sont near Copenhagen, which made a name for itself as the most promising observatory in Europe at the time. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/brahe.html|title=The Galileo Project {{!}} Science {{!}} Tycho Brahe|website=galileo.rice.edu|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\n====Marriage to Kirsten J\u00f8rgensdatter====\nTowards the end of 1571, Tycho fell in love with Kirsten, daughter of J\u00f8rgen Hansen, the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister in Knudstrup.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=45}} As she was a [[commoner]], Tycho never formally married her, since if he did he would lose his noble privileges. However, [[Courts of Denmark|Danish law]] permitted [[morganatic marriage]], which meant that a nobleman and a common woman could live together openly as husband and wife for three years, and their alliance then became a legally binding marriage. However, each would maintain their social status, and any children they had together would be considered commoners, with no rights to titles, landholdings, coat of arms, or even their father's noble name.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=12\u201314}} While King Frederick respected Tycho's choice of wife, himself having been unable to marry the woman he loved, many of Tycho's family members disagreed, and many churchmen would continue to hold the lack of a divinely sanctioned marriage against him. Kirsten J\u00f8rgensdatter gave birth to their first daughter, Kirstine (named after Tycho's late sister) on 12{{nbsp}}October 1573. Kirstine died from the plague in 1576, and Tycho wrote a heartfelt elegy for her tombstone.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}} In 1574, they moved to Copenhagen where their daughter Magdalene was born,{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=60}} later the family followed him into exile.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=207}} Kirsten and Tycho lived together for almost thirty years until Tycho's death.  Together, they had eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood.\n\n====The 1572 supernova====\n[[File:Tycho Cas SN1572.jpg|thumb|left|Star map of the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] showing the position of the [[SN 1572|supernova of 1572]] (the topmost star, labelled ''I''); from Tycho Brahe's ''De nova stella''.]]\nOn 11 November 1572, Tycho observed (from [[Herrevad Abbey]]) a very bright star, now numbered [[SN 1572]], which had unexpectedly appeared in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. Because it had been maintained since [[Ancient history|antiquity]] that the world beyond the Moon's orbit was eternally unchangeable (celestial immutability was a fundamental axiom of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] world-view), other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the terrestrial sphere below the Moon. However, Tycho observed that the object showed no daily [[Diurnal parallax|parallax]] against the background of the fixed stars. This implied that it was at least farther away than the Moon and those planets that do show such parallax. He also found that the object did not change its position relative to the fixed stars over several months, as all planets did in their periodic orbital motions, even the outer planets, for which no daily parallax was detectable. This suggested that it was not even a planet, but a fixed star in the stellar sphere beyond all the planets. In 1573, he published a small book ''De nova stella'',<ref>[http://www.texts.dnlb.dk/DeNovaStella/Index.html ''De nova et nullius \u00e6vi memoria prius visa stella'']. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224211014/http://www.texts.dnlb.dk/DeNovaStella/Index.html |date=2009-02-24 }} \u2013 Photocopy of the Latin print with a partial translation into Danish: \"''Om den nye og aldrig siden Verdens begyndelse i nogen tidsalders erindring f\u00f8r observerede stjerne&nbsp;...''\"</ref> thereby coining the term [[nova]] for a \"new\" star (we now classify this star as a [[supernova]] and know that it is 7500&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from Earth). This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession. Tycho was strongly critical of those who dismissed the implications of the astronomical appearance, writing in the preface to ''De nova stella'': \"''O crassa ingenia. O caecos coeli spectatores''\" (\"Oh thick wits. Oh blind watchers of the sky\"). The publication of his discovery made him a well-known name among scientists across Europe.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pages=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|pp=55\u201360}}\n\n====Lord of Hven====\n[[File:Uraniborgskiss 90.jpg|thumb|right|A hand-painted copper-plate engraving of Uraniborg from Blaeu's ''[[Atlas Maior]]'' (1662-5), based on a woodcut from Brahe's ''Astronomi\u00e6 instaurat\u00e6 mechanica'' (1598).]]\n\nTycho continued with his detailed observations, often assisted by his first assistant and student, his younger sister [[Sophia Brahe|Sophie Brahe]]. In 1574, Tycho published the observations made in 1572 from his first observatory at [[Herrevad Abbey]]. He then started lecturing on astronomy, but gave it up and left Denmark in spring 1575 to tour abroad. He first visited [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]]'s observatory at Kassel, then went on to Frankfurt, Basel and Venice, where he acted as an agent for the Danish king, contacting artisans and craftsmen whom the king wanted to work on his new palace at Elsinore. Upon his return, the King wished to repay Tycho's service by offering him a position worthy of his family; he offered him a choice of lordships of militarily and economically important estates, such as the castles of [[Hammershus]] or [[Helsingborg]]. But Tycho was reluctant to take up a position as a lord of the realm, preferring to focus on his science. He wrote to his friend Johannes Pratensis, \"I did not want to take possession of any of the castles our benevolent king so graciously offered me. I am displeased with society here, customary forms and the whole rubbish\".{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=8}} Tycho secretly began to plan to move to Basel, wishing to participate in the burgeoning academic and scientific life there. But the King heard of Tycho's plans, and desiring to keep the distinguished scientist, he offered Tycho the island of [[Hven]] in [[\u00d8resund]] and funding to set up an observatory.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=7\u20138, 25\u201327}}\n\n[[File:Tycho-Brahe-Mural-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|left|Tycho Brahe's large mural quadrant at Uraniborg]]\n\nUntil then, Hven had been property directly under the Crown, and the 50 families on the island considered themselves to be freeholding farmers, but with Tycho's appointment as Feudal Lord of Hven, this changed. Tycho took control of agricultural planning, requiring the peasants to cultivate twice as much as they had done before, and he also exacted [[corv\u00e9e]] labor from the peasants for the construction of his new castle.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=28\u201339}} The peasants complained about Tycho's excessive taxation and took him to court. The court established Tycho's right to levy taxes and labor, and the result was a contract detailing the mutual obligations of lord and peasants on the island.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=40\u201343}}\n\nTycho envisioned his castle [[Uraniborg]] as a temple dedicated to the [[muse]]s of arts and sciences, rather than as a military fortress; indeed, it was named after [[Urania]], the [[muse]] of astronomy. Construction began in 1576 (with a laboratory for his [[alchemy|alchemical]] experiments in the cellar). Uraniborg was inspired by the Venetian architect [[Andrea Palladio]], and was one of the first buildings in northern Europe to show influence from Italian renaissance architecture. When he realized that the towers of Uraniborg were not adequate as observatories because of the instruments' exposure to the elements and the movement of the building, he then constructed a second underground observatory at nearby [[Stjerneborg]] in 1581. The basement included an alchemical laboratory with 16 furnaces for conducting distillations and other chemical experiments.{{sfn|Shackelford|1993}} Unusually for the time, Tycho established Uraniborg as a research centre, where almost 100 students and artisans worked from 1576 to 1597.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=247}}<ref>{{cite web |last=West |first=Mary Lou |title=Physics Today August 2001 |url=http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-8/p47a.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050215193155/http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-8/p47a.html |archivedate=2005-02-15}}</ref> Uraniborg also contained a printing press and a paper mill, both among the first in Scandinavia, enabling Tycho to publish his own manuscripts, on locally made paper with his own [[watermark]]. He created a system of ponds and canals to run the wheels of the paper mill. Over the years he worked on Uraniborg, Tycho was assisted by a number of students and proteg\u00e9s, many of whom went on to their own careers in astronomy: among them were [[Christian S\u00f8rensen Longomontanus]], later one of the main proponents of the Tychonic model and Tycho's replacement as royal Danish astronomer; [[Peder Fleml\u00f8se]]; [[Elias Olsen Morsing]]; and [[Cort Aslakss\u00f8n]]. Tycho's instrument-maker [[Hans Crol]] also formed part of the scientific community on the island.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=142}}\n[[File:Brahe notebook.jpg|thumb|right|Brahe's notebook with his observations of the 1577 comet]]\n\nHe observed the [[Great Comet of 1577|great comet]] that was visible in the Northern sky from November 1577 to January 1578. Within Lutheranism, it was commonly believed that celestial objects like comets were powerful portents, announcing the coming apocalypse, and in addition to Tycho's observations several Danish amateur astronomers observed the object and published prophesies of impending doom. He was able to determine that the comet's distance to Earth was much greater than the distance of the Moon, so that the comet could not have originated in the \"earthly sphere\", confirming his prior anti-Aristotelian conclusions about the fixed nature of the sky beyond the Moon. He also realized that the comet's [[Comet tail|tail]] was always pointing away from the Sun. He calculated its diameter, mass, and the length of its tail, and speculated about the material it was made of. At this point, he had not yet broken with Copernican theory, and observing the comet inspired him to try to develop an alternative Copernican model in which the Earth was immobile.{{sfn|Christianson|1979}} The second half of his manuscript about the comet dealt with the astrological and apocalyptic aspects of the comet, and he rejected the prophesies of his competitors; instead, making his own predictions of dire political events in the near future.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2004}} Among his predictions was bloodshed in Moscow and the imminent fall of [[Ivan the Terrible]] by 1583.{{efn|Ivan the Terrible died a year later than predicted by Tycho Brahe.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Christianson|1979}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Tycho_Brahe%27s_Stjerneborg.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the above ground parts of Tycho Brahe's underground observatory \"Stjerneborg\".]]\nThe support that Tycho received from the Crown was substantial, amounting to 1% of the annual total revenue at one point in the 1580s.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=188}} Tycho often held large social gatherings in his castle. [[Pierre Gassendi]] wrote that Tycho also had a tame [[Moose|elk]] (moose) and that his mentor the [[Landgrave]] [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (Hesse-Cassel) asked whether there was an animal faster than a deer. Tycho replied that there was none, but he could send his tame elk. When Wilhelm replied he would accept one in exchange for a horse, Tycho replied with the sad news that the elk had just died on a visit to entertain a nobleman at [[Landskrona]]. Apparently, during dinner, the elk had drunk a lot of beer, fallen down the stairs, and died.<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Dreyer |first=J. L.

At the beginning of each year, he had to present an Almanac to the court, predicting the influence of the stars on the political and economic prospects of the year. And at the birth of each prince, he prepared their horoscopes, predicting their fates. He also worked as a cartographer with his former tutor Anders S\u00f8rensen Vedel on mapping out all of the Danish realm.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=62}} An ally of the king and friendly with [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Queen Sophie]] (both his mother Beate Bille and adoptive mother Inger Oxe had been her court maids), he secured a promise from the King that ownership of Hven and Uraniborg would pass to his heirs.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=141}}\n\n====Publications, correspondence and scientific disputes====\n[[File:Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to the 1610<!--The date indicated in the Wikicommons file says \"1609\", but the cover of the book itself says \"1610\".--> edition of ''Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata'']]\nIn 1588, Tycho's royal benefactor died, and a volume of Tycho's great two-volume work ''Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata'' (''Introduction to the New Astronomy'') was published. The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations of 1572\u20133 involved much research to correct the stars' positions for refraction, precession, the motion of the Sun etc., and was not completed in Tycho's lifetime (it was published in Prague in 1602/03), but the second volume, titled ''De Mundi Aetherei Recentioribus Phaenomenis Liber Secundus'' (''Second Book About Recent Phenomena in the Celestial World'') and devoted to the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations, it included an account of Tycho's system of the world.{{sfn|Christianson|1979}} The third volume was intended to treat the comets of 1580 and following years in a similar manner, but it was never published, nor even written, though a great deal of material about the comet of 1585 was put together and first published in 1845 with the observations of this comet.<ref>[[John Louis Emil Dreyer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fqBCAAAAIAAJ& ''Tycho Brahe: a Picture of Scientific Life and Work in the Sixteenth Century''], A. & C.

Thus, his correspondence was crucial to his research. Often, correspondence was not just private communication between scholars, but also a way to disseminate results and arguments and to build progress and scientific consensus. Through correspondence, Tycho was involved in several personal disputes with critics of his theories. Prominent among them were [[John Craig (physician)|John Craig]], a Scottish physician who was a strong believer in the authority of the Aristotelian worldview, and [[Nicolaus Reimers|Nicolaus Reimers Baer]], known as Ursus, an astronomer at the Imperial court in Prague, whom Tycho accused of having plagiarized his cosmological model. Craig refused to accept Tycho's conclusion that the comet of 1577 had to be located within the aetherial sphere rather than within the atmosphere of Earth. Craig tried to contradict Tycho by using his own observations of the comet, and by questioning his methodology. Tycho published an ''apologia'' (a defense) of his conclusions, in which he provided additional arguments, as well as condemning Craig's ideas in strong language for being incompetent. Another dispute concerned the mathematician [[Paul Wittich]], who, after staying on Hven in 1580, taught Count Wilhelm of Kassel and his astronomer [[Christoph Rothmann]] to build copies of Tycho's instruments without permission from Tycho. In turn, Craig, who had studied with Wittich, accused Tycho of minimizing Wittich's role in developing some of the trigonometric methods used by Tycho. In his dealings with these disputes, Tycho made sure to leverage his support in the scientific community, by publishing and disseminating his own answers and arguments.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|pp=179\u201389}}\n\n===Exile and later years===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''Denmark what is my offense?

A regency council was appointed to rule for the young prince-elect until his coronation in 1596. The head of the council (Steward of the Realm) was [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], who disliked Tycho after a conflict between them, and hence Tycho's influence at the Danish court steadily declined. Feeling that his legacy on Hven was in peril, he approached the [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Dowager Queen Sophie]] and asked her to affirm in writing her late husband's promise to endow Hven to Tycho's heirs.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=141}} Nonetheless, he realized that the young king was more interested in war than in science, and was of no mind to keep his father's promise. King Christian IV followed a policy of curbing the power of the nobility by confiscating their estates to minimize their income bases, by accusing nobles of misusing their offices and of heresies against the Lutheran church. Tycho, who was known to sympathize with the [[Philippists]] (followers of [[Philip Melanchthon]]), was among the nobles who fell out of grace with the new king. The king's unfavorable disposition towards Tycho was likely also a result of efforts by several of his enemies at court to turn the king against him. Tycho's enemies included, in addition to Valkendorff, the king's doctor Peter Severinus, who also had personal gripes with Tycho, and several [[gnesio-Lutheran]] Bishops who suspected Tycho of heresy \u2014 a suspicion motivated by his known Philippist sympathies, his pursuits in medicine and alchemy (both of which he practiced without the church's approval) and his prohibiting the local priest on Hven to include the exorcism in the baptismal ritual. Among the accusations raised against Tycho were his failure to adequately maintain the royal chapel at Roskilde, and his harshness and exploitation of the Hven peasantry.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}}\n\nTycho became even more inclined to leave when a mob of commoners, possibly incited by his enemies at court, rioted in front of his house in Copenhagen. Tycho left Hven in 1597, bringing some of his instruments with him to Copenhagen, and entrusting others to a caretaker on the island. Shortly before leaving, he completed his star catalogue giving the positions of 1,000 stars.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}} After some unsuccessful attempts at influencing the king to let him return; including showcasing his instruments on the wall of the city, he finally acquiesced to exile, but he wrote his most famous poem ''Elegy to Dania'' in which he chided Denmark for not appreciating his genius. The instruments he had used in [[Uraniborg]] and [[Stjerneborg]] were depicted and described in detail in his book ''Astronomiae instauratae mechanica'' or ''Instruments for the restoration of astronomy'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/HST/Brahe/brahe-introduction.htm#book |title=Astronomi\u00e6 instaurat\u00e6 mechanica by Tycho Brahe: Introduction |first=Ronald |last=Brashear |work=Special Collections Department |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries |date=May 1999 |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> first published in 1598.

The emperor then brought him back to Prague, where he stayed until his death. At the imperial court even Tycho's wife and children were treated like nobility, which they had never been at the Danish court.{{sfn|H\u00e5kansson|2006|p=68}}\n\nTycho received financial support from several nobles in addition to the emperor, including Oldrich Desiderius Pruskowsky von Pruskow, to whom he dedicated his famous ''Mechanica''. In return for their support, Tycho's duties included preparing [[astrological chart]]s and predictions for his patrons at events such as births, [[weather forecasting]], and astrological interpretations of significant astronomical events, such as the [[SN 1572|supernova of 1572]] (sometimes called Tycho's supernova) and the [[Great Comet of 1577]].<ref>Adam Mosley and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science of the [[University of Cambridge]].

Kepler had previously spoken highly of Ursus, but now found himself in the problematic position of being employed by Tycho and having to defend his employer against Ursus' accusations, even though he disagreed with both of their planetary models. In 1600, he finished the tract ''Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum'' (defense of Tycho against Ursus).{{sfn|Jardine|2006}}{{sfn|Mosley|2007|p=28}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2002}} Kepler had great respect for Tycho's methods and the accuracy of his observations and considered him to be the new [[Hipparchus]], who would provide the foundation for a restoration of the science of astronomy.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|p=304}}\n\n===Illness, death, and investigations===\n[[File:Tycho Brahe Grave DSCN2900.jpg|thumb|Tycho Brahe's grave in Prague, new tomb stone from 1901]]\nTycho suddenly contracted a bladder or kidney ailment after attending a banquet in Prague, and died eleven days later, on 24 October 1601, at the age of 54. It is also said that Tycho had been suffering from an illness which he had attempted to take care of himself with his alchemy skills, but failed and rather contributed to his death.

Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a [[telescope]], soon to be turned skyward by [[Galileo Galilei]] and others. Given the limitations of the naked eye for making accurate observations, he devoted many of his efforts to improving the accuracy of the existing types of instrument \u2014 the [[sextant]] and the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. He designed larger versions of these instruments, which allowed him to achieve much higher accuracy. Because of the accuracy of his instruments, he quickly realized the influence of wind and the movement of buildings, and instead opted to mount his instruments underground directly on the bedrock.{{sfn|Christianson|2000|pp=83}}\n\nTycho's observations of [[star|stellar]] and [[planet]]ary positions were noteworthy both for their accuracy and quantity.{{sfn|Swerdlow|1996|pp=207\u2013210}} With an accuracy approaching one arcminute, his celestial positions were much more accurate than those of any predecessor or contemporary \u2014 about five times as accurate as the observations of the contemporary astronomer [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm of Hesse]].{{sfn|H\u00f8g|2009}} {{harvcoltxt|Rawlins|1993|p=\u00a7B2}} asserts of Tycho's Star Catalog D, \"In it, Tycho achieved, on a mass scale, a precision far beyond that of earlier catalogers.

But, in fact, many of the stellar positions in his star catalogues were less accurate than that. The median errors for the stellar positions in his final published catalog were about 1.5', indicating that only half of the entries were more accurate than that, with an overall mean error in each coordinate of around 2'.{{sfn|Rawlins|1993|p=12}} Although the stellar observations as recorded in his observational logs were more accurate, varying from 32.3\" to 48.8\" for different instruments,{{sfn|Wesley|1978|pp=42\u201353, table 4.}} systematic errors of as much as 3' were introduced into some of the stellar positions Tycho published in his star catalog \u2014 due, for instance, to his application of an erroneous ancient value of parallax and his neglect of polestar refraction.{{sfn|Rawlins|1993|p=20, n. 70}} Incorrect transcription in the final published star catalogue, by scribes in Tycho's employ, was the source of even larger errors, sometimes by many degrees.{{efn|Victor Thoren<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Thoren|1989}}</ref> says: \"[the accuracy of the 777 star catalogue C] falls below the standards Tycho maintained for his other activities&nbsp;... the catalogue left the best qualified appraiser of it (Tycho's eminent biographer J. L. E. Dreyer) manifestly disappointed. Some 6% of its final 777 positions have errors in one or both co-ordinates that can only have arisen from 'handling' problems of one kind or another. And while the brightest stars were generally placed with the minute-of-arc accuracy Tycho expected to achieve in every aspect of his work, the fainter stars (for which the slits on his sights had to be widened, and the sharpness of their alignment reduced) were considerably less well located.\" (ii) M. Hoskin<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Hoskin|1999}}, p. 101</ref> concurs with Thoren's finding \"Yet although the places of the brightest of the non-reference stars [in the 777 star catalogue] are mostly correct to around the minute of arc that was his standard, the fainter stars are less accurately located, and there are many errors.\" (iii) The greatest max errors are given by Dennis Rawlins.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Rawlins|1993}}, p. 42</ref> They are in descending order a 238\u00b0 scribal error in the right ascension of star D723; a 36\u00b0 scribal error in the right ascension of D811; a 23\u00b0 latitude error in all 188 southern stars by virtue of a scribal error; a 20\u00b0 scribal error in longitude of D429; and a 13.5\u00b0 error in the latitude of D811.}}\n\nCelestial objects observed near the horizon and above appear with a greater [[altitude]] than the real one, due to atmospheric [[refraction]], and one of Tycho's most important innovations was that he worked out and published the very first tables for the systematic correction of this possible source of error. But, as advanced as they were, they attributed no refraction whatever above 45\u00b0 altitude for solar refraction, and none for starlight above 20\u00b0 altitude.{{sfn|Thoren|1989|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nTo perform the huge number of multiplications needed to produce much of his astronomical data, Tycho relied heavily on the then-new technique of ''[[prosthaphaeresis]]'', an algorithm for approximating products based on [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]] that predated logarithms.{{sfn|Thoren|1988}}\n\n===The Tychonic cosmological model===\n{{Main article|Tychonic system}}\n[[File:Tychonian system.svg|thumb|left|In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around the Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars.]]\n\nAlthough Tycho admired Copernicus and was the first to teach his theory in Denmark, he was unable to reconcile Copernican theory with the basic laws of [[Aristotelian physics]], that he considered to be foundational. He was also critical of the observational data that Copernicus built his theory on, which he correctly considered to have a high margin of error. Instead, Tycho proposed a \"geo-heliocentric\" system in which the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, while the other planets orbited the Sun. Tycho's system had many of the same observational and computational advantages that Copernicus' system had, and both systems also could accommodate the phases of Venus, although Galilei had yet to discover them. Tycho's system provided a safe position for astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models but were reluctant to accept the heliocentrism and the Earth's motion.{{sfn|Hetherington|Hetherington|2009|p=134}} It gained a considerable following after 1616 when Rome declared that the heliocentric model was contrary to both philosophy and Scripture, and could be discussed only as a computational convenience that had no connection to fact.{{sfn|Russell|1989}} Tycho's system also offered a major innovation: while both the purely [[geocentric model]] and the heliocentric model as set forth by Copernicus relied on the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits, Tycho eliminated the spheres entirely. Kepler, as well as other Copernican astronomers, tried to persuade Tycho to adopt the heliocentric model of the [[Solar System]], but he was not persuaded. According to Tycho, the idea of a rotating and revolving Earth would be \"in violation not only of all physical truth but also of the authority of Holy Scripture, which ought to be paramount.\"{{sfn|Repcheck|2008|p=187}}\n\nWith respect to physics, Tycho held that the Earth was just too sluggish and heavy to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens (whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending) were made of [[Aether (classical element)|\"Aether\" or \"Quintessence\"]]; this substance, not found on Earth, was light, strong, unchanging, and its natural state was circular motion. By contrast, the Earth (where objects seem to have motion only when moved) and things on it were composed of substances that were heavy and whose natural state was rest. Accordingly, Tycho said the Earth was a \"lazy\" body that was not readily moved.{{sfn|Blair|1990|pp=361\u2013362}}{{sfn|Moesgaard|1972|p=40}}{{sfn|Gingerich|1973|p=87}} Thus while Tycho acknowledged that the daily rising and setting of the Sun and stars could be explained by the Earth's rotation, as Copernicus had said, still <blockquote>such a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Blair|1990}}, page 361.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nWith respect to the stars, Tycho also believed that, if the Earth orbited the Sun annually, there should be an observable [[stellar parallax]] over any period of six months, during which the angular orientation of a given star would change thanks to Earth's changing position. (This parallax does exist, but is so small it was not detected until 1838, when [[Friedrich Bessel]] discovered a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of the star [[61 Cygni]].<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bessel.html Bessel biography]. [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 2008-09-28</ref>) The Copernican explanation for this lack of parallax was that the stars were such a great distance from Earth that Earth's orbit was almost insignificant by comparison. However, Tycho noted that this explanation introduced another problem: Stars as seen by the naked eye appear small, but of some size, with more prominent stars such as [[Vega]] appearing larger than lesser stars such as [[Polaris]], which in turn appear larger than many others. Tycho had determined that a typical star measured approximately a minute of arc in size, with more prominent ones being two or three times as large. In writing to [[Christoph Rothmann]], a Copernican astronomer, Tycho used basic geometry to show that, assuming a small parallax that just escaped detection, the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the Sun to Saturn. Moreover, the only way the stars could be so distant and still appear the sizes they do in the sky would be if even average stars were gigantic \u2014 at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the Sun. And, Tycho said, the more prominent stars would have to be even larger still. And what if the parallax was even smaller than anyone thought, so the stars were yet more distant? Then they would all have to be even larger still.{{sfn|Blair|1990|p=364}}{{sfn|Moesgaard|1972|p=51}} Tycho said<blockquote>Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Blair|1990}}, page 364.</ref></blockquote> Copernicans offered a religious response to Tycho's geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if He wanted.{{sfn|Moesgaard|1972|p=52}}{{sfn|Vermij|2007|pp=124\u2013125}} In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho's by saying: <blockquote>\"[W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from here anything of the absurd. These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand. Grant the vastness of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be as great as you like \u2014 these will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator. It reckons that the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his majesty. So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?\".{{sfn|Graney|2012|p=217}}</blockquote>\n\nReligion played a role in Tycho's geocentrism also \u2013 he cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest. He rarely used Biblical arguments alone (to him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth's motion) and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously.{{sfn|Blair|1990|pp=362\u2013364}}\n\nTycho's 1587 geo-heliocentric model differed from those of other geo-heliocentric astronomers, such as [[Paul Wittich]], [[Reimarus Ursus]], [[Helisaeus Roeslin]] and [[David Origanus]], in that the orbits of Mars and the Sun intersected. This was because Tycho had come to believe the distance of Mars from the Earth at opposition (that is, when Mars is on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun) was less than that of the Sun from the Earth. Tycho believed this because he came to believe Mars had a greater daily parallax than the Sun. But, in 1584, in a letter to a fellow astronomer, Brucaeus, he had claimed that Mars had been further than the Sun at the opposition of 1582, because he had observed that Mars had little or no daily parallax. He said he had therefore rejected Copernicus's model because it predicted Mars would be at only two-thirds the distance of the Sun.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dreyer|1890}}, p 178\u2013180</ref> But, he apparently later changed his mind to the opinion that Mars at opposition was indeed nearer the Earth than the Sun was, but apparently without any valid observational evidence in any discernible Martian parallax.<ref>{{citation |last1= Gingerich |last2= Westman |title= The Wittich Connection |year= 1988 |page= 171}}</ref> Such intersecting Martian and solar orbits meant that there could be no solid rotating celestial spheres, because they could not possibly interpenetrate. Arguably, this conclusion was independently supported by the conclusion that the comet of 1577 was superlunary, because it showed less daily parallax than the Moon and thus must pass through any celestial spheres in its transit.\n\n===Lunar theory===\nTycho's distinctive contributions to [[lunar theory]] include his discovery of the [[variation (astronomy)|variation]] of the Moon's longitude. This represents the largest inequality of longitude after the [[equation of the center]] and the [[evection]]. He also discovered librations in the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit, relative to the ecliptic (which is not a constant of about 5\u00b0 as had been believed before him, but fluctuates through a range of over a quarter of a degree), and accompanying oscillations in the longitude of the [[lunar node]]. These represent perturbations in the Moon's ecliptic latitude. Tycho's lunar theory doubled the number of distinct lunar inequalities, relative to those anciently known, and reduced the discrepancies of lunar theory to about a fifth of their previous amounts. It was published posthumously by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] in 1602, and Kepler's own derivative form appears in Kepler's ''Rudolphine Tables'' of 1627.{{sfn|Thoren|1967}}\n\n===Subsequent developments in astronomy ===\nKepler used Tycho's records of the motion of Mars to deduce [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]],{{sfn|Stephenson|1987|pp=22, 39, 51, 204}} enabling calculation of astronomical tables with unprecedented accuracy (the ''Rudolphine Tables''){{efn|According to Owen Gingerich<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Gingerich|1989}}, page 77</ref> and Christopher Linton,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Linton|2004}}, page 224</ref> these tables were some 30 times more accurate than other astronomical tables then available.}} and providing powerful support for a [[heliocentric]] model of the [[solar system]].{{sfn|Swerdlow|2004|p=96}}{{sfn|Stephenson|1987|pp=67\u201368}}\n[[File:Naboth Capella.JPG|thumb|[[Valentin Naboth]]'s drawing of [[Martianus Capella]]'s geo-heliocentric astronomical model (1573)]]\n\n[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s 1610 telescopic discovery that Venus shows a full set of phases refuted the pure geocentric Ptolemaic model. After that it seems 17th-century astronomy mostly converted to geo-heliocentric planetary models that could explain these phases just as well as the heliocentric model could, but without the latter's disadvantage of the failure to detect any annual [[stellar parallax]] that Tycho and others regarded as refuting it.{{sfn|Taton|Wilson|1989}} The three main geo-heliocentric models were the Tychonic, the Capellan with just Mercury and Venus orbiting the Sun such as favoured by [[Francis Bacon]], for example, and the extended Capellan model of [[Riccioli]] with Mars also orbiting the Sun whilst Saturn and Jupiter orbit the fixed Earth. But the Tychonic model was probably the most popular, albeit probably in what was known as 'the semi-Tychonic' version with a daily rotating Earth. This model was advocated by Tycho's ex-assistant and disciple [[Longomontanus]] in his 1622 ''Astronomia Danica'' that was the intended completion of Tycho's planetary model with his observational data, and which was regarded as the canonical statement of the complete Tychonic planetary system. Longomontanus' work was published in several editions and used by many subsequent astronomers, and through him the Tychonic system was adopted by astronomers as far away as China.{{sfn|Hashimoto|1987}}\n\n[[File:Libr0309.jpg|thumb|Johannes Kepler published the ''Rudolphine Tables'' containing a star catalog and planetary tables using Tycho's measurements.

Among pro-Tycho Jesuits, Ignace Pardies declared in 1691 that it was still the commonly accepted system, and Francesco Blanchinus reiterated that as late as 1728.{{sfn|Schofield|1989|p=41}} Persistence of the Tychonic system, especially in Catholic countries, has been attributed to its satisfaction of a need (relative to Catholic doctrine) for \"a safe synthesis of ancient and modern\". After 1670, even many Jesuit writers only thinly disguised their Copernicanism. But in Germany, the Netherlands, and England, the Tychonic system \"vanished from the literature much earlier\".{{sfn|Schofield|1989|p=43}}\n\n[[James Bradley]]'s discovery of [[stellar aberration]], published in 1729, eventually gave direct evidence excluding the possibility of all forms of geocentrism including Tycho's. Stellar aberration could only be satisfactorily explained on the basis that the Earth is in annual orbit around the Sun, with an orbital velocity that combines with the finite speed of the light coming from an observed star or planet, to affect the apparent direction of the body observed.{{sfn|Wilson|1989|p=205}}\n\n===Work in medicine, alchemy and astrology===\nTycho also worked in medicine and alchemy. He was strongly influenced by Paracelsus, who considered the human body to be directly influenced by celestial bodies. The paracelsian view of man as a microcosm, and astrology as the science tying together the celestial and bodily universes was also shared by Philip Melanchthon, and was precisely one of the points of contention between Melanchthon and Luther, and hence between the philippists and the gnesio-Lutherans.{{sfn|Christianson|1979}} For Tycho there was a close connection between empiricism and natural science on one hand and religion and astrology on the other.{{sfn|Alm\u00e1si|2013}} Using his large herbal garden at Uraniborg, Tycho produced several recipes for herbal medicines, using them to treat illnesses such as fever and plague.{{sfn|Figala|1972}} In his own time, Tycho was also famous for his contributions to medicine; his herbal medicines were in use as late as the 1900s.{{sfn|Kragh|2005|p=243}} The expression [[Tycho Brahe days]], in Scandinavian folklore, refers to a number of \"unlucky days\" that were featured in many almanacs beginning in the 1700s, but which have no direct connection to Tycho or his work.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=215}} Whether because he realized that astrology was not an empirical science or because he feared religious repercussions Tycho seems to have had a somewhat ambiguous relation to his own astrological work. For example, two of his more astrological treatises, one on weather predictions and an almanac, were published in the names of his assistants, in spite of the fact that he worked on them personally. Some scholars have argued that he lost faith in horoscope astrology over the course of his career,{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=215\u2013216}} and others that he simply changed his public communication on the topic as he realized that connections with astrology could influence the reception of his empirical astronomical work.{{sfn|Alm\u00e1si|2013}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Brahe kepler.jpg|thumb|Monument of Tycho Brahe and [[Johannes Kepler]] in [[Prague]]]]\n\n===Biographies===\nThe first biography of Tycho, which was also the first full-length biography of any scientist, was written by [[Pierre Gassendi]] in 1654.{{sfn|Kragh|2007|p=122}} In 1779, Tycho de Hoffmann wrote of Tycho's life in his history of the Brahe family. In 1913, Dreyer published Tycho's collected works, facilitating further research. Early modern scholarship on Tycho tended to see the shortcomings of his astronomical model, painting him as a mysticist recalcitrant in accepting the Copernican revolution, and valuing mostly his observations that allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of planetary movement. Especially in Danish scholarship, Tycho was depicted as a mediocre scholar and a traitor to the nation \u2014 perhaps because of the important role in Danish historiography of Christian IV as a warrior king.{{sfn|Bj\u00f6rklund|1992}} In the second half of the 20th century, scholars began reevaluating is significance and studies by Kristian Peder Moesgaard, Owen Gingerich, Robert Westman, Victor E. Thoren, and John R. Christianson focused on his contributions to science, and demonstrated that while he admired Copernicus he was simply unable to reconcile his basic theory of physics with the Copernican view.{{sfn|Christianson|2002}}{{sfn|Christianson|1998}} Christianson's work showed the influence of Tycho's Uraniborg as a training center for scientists who after studying with Tycho went on to make contributions in various scientific fields.{{sfn|Kragh|2007}}\n\n===Scientific legacy===\nAlthough Tycho's planetary model was soon discredited, his astronomical observations were an essential contribution to the [[scientific revolution]]. The traditional view of Tycho is that he was primarily an empiricist who set new standards for precise and objective measurements.{{sfn|Kragh|2005|pages=220\u201322}} This appraisal originated in [[Pierre Gassendi]]'s 1654 biography, ''Tychonis Brahe, equitis Dani, astronomorum coryphaei, vita''. It was furthered by [[Johann Dreyer]]'s biography in 1890, which was long the most influential work on Tycho. According to historian of science Helge Kragh, this assessment grew out of Gassendi's opposition to [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Cartesianism]], and fails to account for the diversity of Tycho's activities.{{sfn|Kragh|2005|pages=220\u201322}}\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nTycho's discovery of the new star was the inspiration for [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"[[Al Aaraaf]]\".<ref name=\"Hallqvist2006\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.poedecoder.com/qrisse/bio/westpoint.php\n | title = Al Aaraaf and West Point\n | series = Qrisse's Edgar Allan Poe Pages\n | date = 7 February 2006\n | last1 = Hallqvist\n | first1 = Christoffer\n}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine published an article by Donald W. Olson, Marilynn S. Olson and Russell L. Doescher arguing, in part, that Tycho's supernova was also the same \"star that's westward from the pole\" in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]''.{{sfn|Olson|Olson|Doescher|1998}}\n\nTycho is directly referenced in Sarah Williams' poem The Old Astronomer: \"Reach me down my Tycho Brah\u00e9,\u2014I would know him when we meet\". Though, the poem's oft quoted line comes later: \"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; / I have loved the stars too truly to be fearful of the night.\" [[Alfred Noyes]] also wrote a long biographical poem in honor of Brahe.\n\nThe lunar crater [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]] is named in his honour,<ref>Kenneth R.
