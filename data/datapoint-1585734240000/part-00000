The \"glossy\" production of films such as ''[[Sinasamba Kita]]'', ''[[Palimos ng Pag-ibig (film)|Palimos ng Pag-ibig]]'', ''[[Saan Darating Ang Umaga?]]'', ''[[Kung Mahawi Man Ang Ulap]]'' and ''[[Paano Ba Ang Mangarap?]]'' garnered critical and commercial acclaims. Viva Films also made a documentary film on the Puerto Rican boy group Menudo on their visit to the Philippines in 1985.\n\nViva launched then-supporting actor [[Phillip Salvador]] as an action star in the movie ''Boy Negro''.  It was also instrumental in introducing to the public [[Robin Padilla]] (''Bad Boy'' and ''Anak ni Baby Ama'') and [[Raymart Santiago]] (''Noel Juico: Batang Kriminal'') as new action heroes.  Meanwhile, veteran action stars [[Eddie Garcia]], [[Rudy Fernandez (actor)|Rudy Fernandez]], [[Bong Revilla Jr.]] and [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] also made movies for Viva.\n\nViva also made \"glossy\" comedy films like ''[[Working Girls (2010 film)|Working Girls]]'' and ''Sa Totoo Lang'' which featured serious actors and actresses as main characters instead of comedians.  The company also gambled on new comedians as the '80s decade was about to end. Comedy flicks such as ''[[Puto]]'', ''Jack en Jill'', ''Humanap ka ng Panget'' and ''I Love You Three Times a Day'' launched the respective careers of [[Herbert Bautista]], [[Andrew E]]. and [[Jimmy Santos]]. In the 1990s, Viva launched the careers of Dennis Padilla and Janno Gibbs as solo comedians while reviving the film careers of veteran comedians Redford White (''Neber 2 Geder''), Chiquito (''Pinagbiyak na Bunga'') and Joey de Leon (''Hibangers'').\n\nViva also made a comeback movie with Vic Sotto for the movie ''Basta Ikaw, Naninigig Pa!'' with sexy actress Rosanna Roces, Valentin, Val Sotto, Nova Villa & Yoyong Martirez in 1999.\n\nViva was also known as home to quality youth-oriented films, starting with the 1984 breakthrough flick, ''[[Bagets]]''. The movie was top billed by [[William Martinez (actor)|William Martinez]] and launched the careers of then unknowns [[J.C. Bonnin]], [[Herbert Bautista]], [[Raymond Lauchengco]] and [[Aga Muhlach]].  With its box-office success, the company produced a sequel ''[[Bagets]] 2'' with Ramon Christopher, [[Jon Hernandez]] and [[Francis Magalona]] joining the original cast, the success of the two ''Bagets'' film made it the flagship movie of VIVA films & it set the trend for youth-oriented movies in the 80's which other film companies copied, but they never matched nor equaled the success brought about by thehe two ''Bagets'' films.\n\nIn 1989, Viva introduced its second batch of young stars via the youth-oriented comedy ''Estudyante Blues''. It introduced to the public young stars & ''That's Entertainment'' mainstays such as [[Vina Morales]], [[Gelli de Belen]], [[Keempee de Leon]], [[Raymart Santiago]] and [[Dingdong Avanzado]].  The movie was also a resounding success, despite the fact that ''Estudyante Blues'' became an earlier hit via the Philippine music airwaves as a single sung by [[Freddie Aguilar]].\n\nViva later on entered into television production by partnering with [[GMA Network]]. Their first venture together was the sitcom ''[[Ober Da Bakod]]'' in 1992 with then rising young talents [[Donita Rose]], [[Gelli de Belen]], and [[Janno Gibbs]] and [[Anjo Yllana]] as main stars, followed by the soap opera ''[[Villa Quintana]]'' in 1994 with [[Donna Cruz]] and [[Keempee de Leon]] as lead stars. However, it was the 1995 youth-oriented series ''[[TGIS]]'' that gave Viva its biggest success as a television producer. Headlined by [[Angelu de Leon]], it gave birth the careers of [[Bobby Andrews]], Michael Flores, [[Onemig Bondoc]], Red Sternberg, [[Raven Villanueva]] and [[Ciara Sotto]].  The success of the TV series was later translated to the big screen, when the ''TGIS'' group became box-office stars via the movies ''Takot Ka Ba sa Dilim?'' and ''TGIS the Movie'' (co-produced by GMA). This was followed by the Viva Teen Barkadas headed by [[Dingdong Dantes]], [[Anne Curtis]], [[Sunshine Dizon]], Kim Delos Santos, [[Antoinette Taus]], [[Polo Ravales]], Dino Guevarra, Chubi del Rosario.\n\nViva Films made a comeback by co-producing with new players [[GMA Films]] and [[Star Cinema]] while producing its own films. Among the movies that the company co-produced or solely produced were ''[[Till I Met You]]'' (with [[GMA Films]]),  ''[[Wag Kang Lilingon]]'' (with [[Star Cinema]]), ''[[Ang Cute Ng Ina Mo|Ang Cute ng Ina Mo]]'' (with [[Star Cinema]]), ''[[Paano Kita Iibigin]]'' (with [[Star Cinema]]), ''[[Ouija (2007 film)|Ouija]]'' (with [[GMA Films]]), ''[[Apat Dapat, Dapat Apat|Apat Dapat Dapat Apat: Friends 4 Lyf and Death]]'' (with On-Q 28 Productions), ''Ikaw Pa Rin: Bongga Ka Boy'', ''[[When Love Begins]]'' (with [[Star Cinema]]), ''[[A Very Special Love]]'' (with [[Star Cinema]]), recently in 2009, ''Status: Single'' (with On-Q 28 Productions), ''[[You Changed My Life]]'' (with [[Star Cinema]]), and ''[[Patient X (film)|Patient X]]'' (with [[GMA Films]] and RGUTZ Productions), and on 2010, [[Babe, I Love You]] (with Star Cinema), ''[[Working Girls (2010 film)|Working Girls]]'' (with GMA Films and Unitel Pictures), ''[[Hating Kapatid]]'', ''[[In Your Eyes (2010 film)|In Your Eyes]]'' (with GMA Films), and ''[[Petrang Kabayo]]''.

The movie block, titled ''Viva Box Office Hits'', showed early movies of Sharon Cuneta and Gabby Concepcion and other early releases by the company, In 1988, \"Viva Box Office Hits\" was one of the Viva shows that transferred to ABS-CBN (along with \"The Sharon Cuneta Show\") after its original home IBC-13 was sequestered by the Aquino administration.  Despite \"Viva Box Office\"'s cancellation in 1989, succeeding movies produced by Viva Films and its subsidiaries continued to air on ABS-CBN through the network's movie blocks \"Tagalog Movie Greats\" and \"Star Cinema Presents\" until 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Viva switched networks by partnering with [[GMA Network|GMA-7]] where their latest movie releases starting in 1991 onwards were shown every Thursday nights. The movie block was renamed ''Viva Sinerama''.  The said partnership initially caused controversy after former media partner ABS-CBN filed an injunction to block the partnership as the network launched their own motion picture company [[Star Cinema]] a year later. The said injunction affected the airing of the 1991 box-office hit \"Maging Sino ka Man\" which was supposed to be Viva's maiden offering on \"Viva Sinerama\".  After the court decided in favor of the Viva-GMA partnership, the said movie finally aired after six months.  It was also during the GMA era where Viva aired another movie block on Monday nights called ''MVP (Monday Viva Presentations)'' in 1994, primarily to compete with ABS-CBN's then top-rating movie block ''Regal Presents''.\n\nDuring the new millennium, Viva diversified its movie library where it was aired randomly on [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]] (via Viva TV primetime block) and [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC-5 (now TV5)]] (via the Viva Box Office movie block).\n\nFrom free TV, Viva was able to tie up with [[Hong Kong]]-based Star TV (now [[Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific]], a division of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International]]) to create an all-Filipino international movie channel on May 6, 1996, called [[Viva Cinema]]. Viva Cinema aired over 300 movies coming from the Viva library, including latest releases.  It also aired behind-the-scenes outtakes and refreshing entertainment shows. The partnership between Viva and Star TV ended on July 31, 2003 when Viva created its own movie channel, PBO ([[Pinoy Box Office]]) and entrusted the entire Viva movie library to [[ABS-CBN]] by allowing it to air over. [[Viva Prime Channel]] air mostly action and Drama movies at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. only every other week of the month. Viva Cinema return on February 2009 along with the launch of Philippine DTH's [[Cignal Digital TV]] of the same month. Aside from Viva entrusted the entire Viva library to ABS-CBN co-productions of Viva and Star Cinema are also aired exclusively via ABS-CBN's movie block ''Kapamilya Blockbusters'' and [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]]'s movie blocks ''Movie Action Zone'' and ''Lunch Blockbuster'', and via Viva Cinema, [[Viva Prime Channel]], and PBO. While co-productions of Viva and GMA Films are exclusively aired via [[GMA Network|GMA's]] movie blocks ''Kapuso Movie Festival'' and/or ''Kapuso Movie Night'', [[GMA News TV]]'s movie block ''Takilya Blockbuster'', and via Viva Cinema, Viva Prime Channel, and PBO.\n\nIn 2015, Viva partnered with TV5 to provide entertainment content.  This transpired after the TV network dissolved its entertainment department to make room for blocktimers and content providers.  It is said that Viva will be the biggest content contributor for the network. However, its partnership with TV5 terminated between July and August 2016 as former [[Gilas Pilipinas]] and PBA head coach, Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes takes over as President and CEO of TV5.\n\n==P1.1-billion IPO==\nOn January 2008, Viva chairman Vic del Rosario announced that Viva Communications expected to raise P1.1 billion through approval of the [[initial public offering]] (IPO) by the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]], on listing date of March 5. It planned to sell up P 92.8 million new shares and P 49.9 million secondary shares at P 12.93 / share (offer is 35% of the company's issued and outstanding [[capital stock]]). It appointed [[Banco de Oro]] (BDO) Capital and Investment Corporation as lead [[underwriter]] and Abacus Capital and Investments Corporation as co-lead underwriter. Viva's net income was P 121 million for January to October 2007, double its 2006 earnings and projects net profit of P 330 million this year.<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080122-114041/Viva-Films-plans-P11-billion-IPO Inquirer.net, Viva Films plans P1.1-billion IPO]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sine Novela]] \u2013 movies of Viva Films remade by [[GMA Network]] for afternoon drama in television\n* [[Babangon Ako't Dudurugin Kita]] \u2013 a non-[[Sine Novela]] created by [[Gilda Olvidado]] and Viva Films remade by [[GMA Network]] for prime-time drama in GMA Telebabad.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0046157/ List of Viva Films Movies at IMDB.Com]\n\n{{Viva Communications}}\n{{Philippine production companies and film studios}}\n\n[[Category:Viva Films| ]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Media companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1981]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1981]]\n[[Category:Philippine film studios]]\n[[Category:1981 establishments in the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n{{lead too short|date=April 2019}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name     = Viva Films\n| type     = [[Subsidiary]] of [[Viva Entertainment]]\n| logo     = Viva Films.jpg\n| logo_size = 155px\n| owner            = \n| parent           = [[Viva Entertainment]]\n| foundation       = [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]] ({{Start date and age|1981|11|11}})\n| location_city    = [[Quezon City]]\n| location_country = [[Philippines]]\n| area_served      = Worldwide\n| key_people       = Vicente G. del Rosario III (Chairman of the Board and CEO)<br />Veronique del Rosario-Corpus\n| industry         = [[Motion picture]]s\n| products         = Motion pictures\n}}\n'''Viva Films''' is a Filipino film production company founded on November 11, 1981 by Vicente del Rosario, Jr. It is owned by [[Viva Entertainment]].\n\n==History==\nVeering away from the Sharon Cuneta-Gabby Concepcion tandem, Viva became home of quality dramatic films.

The movie block, titled ''Viva Box Office Hits'', showed early movies of Sharon Cuneta and Gabby Concepcion and other early releases by the company, In 1988, \"Viva Box Office Hits\" was one of the Viva shows that transferred to ABS-CBN (along with \"The Sharon Cuneta Show\") after its original home IBC-13 was sequestered by the Aquino administration.  Despite \"Viva Box Office\"'s cancellation in 1989, succeeding movies produced by Viva Films and its subsidiaries continued to air on ABS-CBN through the network's movie blocks \"Tagalog Movie Greats\" and \"Star Cinema Presents\" until 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Viva switched networks by partnering with [[GMA Network|GMA-7]] where their latest movie releases starting in 1991 onwards were shown every Thursday nights. The movie block was renamed ''Viva Sinerama''.  The said partnership initially caused controversy after former media partner ABS-CBN filed an injunction to block the partnership as the network launched their own motion picture company [[Star Cinema]] a year later. The said injunction affected the airing of the 1991 box-office hit \"Maging Sino ka Man\" which was supposed to be Viva's maiden offering on \"Viva Sinerama\".  After the court decided in favor of the Viva-GMA partnership, the said movie finally aired after six months.  It was also during the GMA era where Viva aired another movie block on Monday nights called ''MVP (Monday Viva Presentations)'' in 1994, primarily to compete with ABS-CBN's then top-rating movie block ''Regal Presents''.\n\nDuring the new millennium, Viva diversified its movie library where it was aired randomly on [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]] (via Viva TV primetime block) and [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC-5 (now TV5)]] (via the Viva Box Office movie block).\n\nFrom free TV, Viva was able to tie up with [[STAR TV (Asia)|Star TV]] and [[Fox International Channels Philippines]] to create an all-Filipino international movie channel on May 6, 1996, called [[Viva Cinema]]. Viva Cinema aired over 300 movies coming from the Viva library, including latest releases.  It also aired behind-the-scenes outtakes and refreshing entertainment shows. The partnership between Viva and Star TV ended on July 31, 2003 when Viva created its own movie channel, PBO ([[Pinoy Box Office]]) and entrusted the entire Viva movie library to [[ABS-CBN]] by allowing it to air over. [[Viva Prime Channel]] air mostly action and Drama movies at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. only every other week of the month. Viva Cinema return on February 2009 along with the launch of Philippine DTH's [[Cignal Digital TV]] of the same month. Aside from Viva entrusted the entire Viva library to ABS-CBN co-productions of Viva and Star Cinema are also aired exclusively via ABS-CBN's movie block ''Kapamilya Blockbusters'' and [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]]'s movie blocks ''Movie Action Zone'' and ''Lunch Blockbuster'', and via Viva Cinema, [[Viva Prime Channel]], and PBO. While co-productions of Viva and GMA Films are exclusively aired via [[GMA Network|GMA's]] movie blocks ''Kapuso Movie Festival'' and/or ''Kapuso Movie Night'', [[GMA News TV]]'s movie block ''Takilya Blockbuster'', and via Viva Cinema, Viva Prime Channel, and PBO.\n\nIn 2015, Viva partnered with TV5 to provide entertainment content.  This transpired after the TV network dissolved its entertainment department to make room for blocktimers and content providers.  It is said that Viva will be the biggest content contributor for the network. However, its partnership with TV5 terminated between July and August 2016 as former [[Gilas Pilipinas]] and PBA head coach, Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes takes over as President and CEO of TV5.\n\n==P1.1-billion IPO==\nOn January 2008, Viva chairman Vic del Rosario announced that Viva Communications expected to raise P1.1 billion through approval of the [[initial public offering]] (IPO) by the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]], on listing date of March 5. It planned to sell up P 92.8 million new shares and P 49.9 million secondary shares at P 12.93 / share (offer is 35% of the company's issued and outstanding [[capital stock]]). It appointed [[Banco de Oro]] (BDO) Capital and Investment Corporation as lead [[underwriter]] and Abacus Capital and Investments Corporation as co-lead underwriter.
