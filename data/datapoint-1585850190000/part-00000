The DC17, DC22, and DC23 use the improved \"Root Cyclone & Core Separator\", also called \"Radix Cyclone\", \"Intermediary Cyclone\", or \"Level 3 Root Cyclone Technology\".\n\nMost of the current range use \"2 Tier Radial cyclones\", consisting of two cascaded levels of [[cyclonic separator]]s to remove dirt and dust without requiring a bag or filter.\n\n== Vacuum cleaners ==\n\n=== Model versions ===\nAll versions are identified by a name such as \"DC14\". Some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities, implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied. Suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model.\n* All Floors, Multi Floor, Wood+Wool: suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets.\n* Allergy: suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens.\n* Animal: so as to pick up animal hairs better than a general-purpose model, and filter out fine particles. These machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair, human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery, cars, and confined areas.\n* Motorhead: cylinder or handheld model with direct-drive motorised brush head.\n* Full Gear: same features as \"Animal\" with more attachments.\n\n==== Special Edition models ====\nOther suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores, e.g. \"Comet Exclusive\" and \"Overdrive\" (Comet) or \"Blitz it\" (Currys).\n\nSome are limited editions:\n\n===== \"Drawing\" limited editions =====\nThese machines feature a different range of tools to the usual \"Multifloor\" and \"Animal\" versions and also appear in different colours. The Drawing later became exclusive to the British [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis Department Store]]s.\n\n===== \"De Stijl\" limited editions =====\nSome of the early Dyson models (DC01, DC02, DC04) were available in a special limited edition \"[[De Stijl]]\" colour scheme, in homage to the Dutch design movement of the same name. All these are coloured a combination of purple, red and yellow.\n\n===== \"Dyson Antarctic Solo\" limited editions =====\nIn 1996, 100,000 recolored DC01 and DC02 models were produced as part of a fund-raising effort for [[Ranulph Fiennes|Ranulph Fiennes's]] solo expedition to the Antarctic. For these models, the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones, and on the DC02 Antarctic Solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver.<ref>Dyson, J.

The vacuum features an updated root cyclone and a redesigned brush roll with more power than the DC41 and a better edge cleaning system. Some variants (like the Animal model) include the Tangle-Free Turbine Tool. Dyson has undergone a name change to their models, and this appears to be the same base design as the new UP13 model marketed as the \"Dyson Ball Allergy\".

The powerhead has 3 levels of suction attained by a slider switch which opens and closes various valves and gates on the powerhead. It is rated at 700W and 80db, in compliance with the EU regulations 2017 for mains powered vacuum cleaners. The Light Ball also has a longer reach cable than the DC40 and differing tools with the \"quick release\" red button system.\n|-\n|Ball 2 \n|''no image''\n|2017\n|Models designated \"2\" incorporate updates and improvements on the original model.

Powered by the Dyson digital motor V6. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 rotations per minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful. The Dyson brand, as well as various reviews, claim that the V6 can have up to a 20-minute run time.<ref name=\"dyson.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dyson.com.au/vacuum-cleaners/handstick/dyson-v6/absolute.aspx|title=Dyson V6 Absolute Handstick Vacuum Cleaner|website=www.dyson.com.au|accessdate=2015-08-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Which Vac\">{{cite web|url=https://whichvac.com/best-cordless-vacuums/dyson/v6-review/#section-6|title=Dyson V6 Vacuum Cleaner|website=whichvac.com|accessdate=2017-05-21}}</ref> The Dyson V6 comes in many different models with varying tools and accessories, including the Dyson Fluffy hard floor roller motorised head, and its top of the range model, the V6 Absolute comes with full HEPA filtration and a 50W main powerhead, giving 150% more brushbar power than the standard 20W powerhead found on lower models. Some versions of the V6, such as the Animal Extra and the Total Clean come with a 35W main powerhead with 75% more brushbar power than the standard head. The V6 develops 28 Airwatts of suction in its extended runtime mode, and 100 Airwatts of suction in its MAX mode, but runtime on a full charge in MAX mode is limited to 6 minutes. Runtime on a full charge using extended run time mode is 20 minutes with the non motorised tools attached, and 15 \u2013 17 minutes with the motorised heads attached. The V6 has been an immensely successful machine for Dyson, but did have issues such as a short runtime, a small dust cup capacity and less than easy dust cup removal, which were all addressed with the next generation of cordless models, the V8 and V7 ranges, which are due to replace the V6.\n|-\n|V8\n|2016\n|The Dyson V8 is an upgraded version of the V6 with better battery life (up to 40 mins without the brush heads),<ref name=\"homecleanexpert.com\">{{cite web|url=https://homecleanexpert.com/best-cordless-vacuum-for-hardwood-floors/#dysonV8|title=Cordless Vacuum Reviews|website=Home Clean Expert|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> a larger dust cup capacity, modifications to the debris emptying process (Called the \"Hygienic dirt ejection system\"), and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor HEPA filter. The V8 produces 22 Air watts of suction on normal (extended runtime) power (28 on the V6) and 115 airwatts in MAX mode (100 on the V6). Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors, which are a 50W main motorised powerhead with nylon and carbon fibre filaments for carpet use and hard floor dusting, a 20W \"Fluffy\" soft roller head for hard floor cleaning, and a 20W mini motorised head, with nylon bristles. Runtimes of the V8 in extended run time mode are 40 minutes with non motorised tools attached, 30 minutes with the fluffy head or mini motorised head attached, and 25 minutes with the main 50W powerhead attached. In MAX mode, the run times are approximately 7 minutes regardless of what tools are fitted. The V8 has full HEPA filtration provided by a removable and washable HEPA exhaust filter located on the back of the motor housing. The HEPA filter system was carried over from the V6 Absolute. The V8 also has a washable pre-motor filter so theoretically no filter replacements should be necessary during the life of the machine. The battery on the V8 is replaceable if necessary.\n|-\n|V7\n|2017\n|Based off the design and overall look of the Dyson V8, the V7, which was launched in 2017, uses a similar digital motor and accessories. However, being a less expensive model to purchase, it has some differences to the higher priced V8. The battery can only run the V7 for up to 30 minutes on a full charge, whereas the V8 can run for up to 40 minutes. The V7 is equipped with a 35W main motorised powerhead, compared to one with 50W on the V8, and also some models of V7 come with a 20W mini electric turbo tool of a slightly differing design to that of the V8. As it has a physically smaller battery than the V8, the V7 weighs less than the V8. In terms of performance, the V7 produces 21 Airwatts of suction on \"extended run time\" mode, compared to 22 on the V8 and 28 on the V6, and it produces 100 Airwatts (as on the V6) on Max mode, compared to 115 airwatts on the V8. Most models of V7 do not come equipped with a HEPA removable exhaust filter. Like the V8, the V7 incorporates the hygienic dirt ejection system, and the quick release \"red button\" tools system, and it also has the same, larger dust cup capacity of the V8. It also, like the V8, runs for up to 7 minutes, when put in Max mode.\n|-\n|V8 Carbon Fiber\n|\n|2017\n|The Dyson V8 Carbon Fiber is an upgrade version of V8 with a much more powerful motor. The V8 Carbon Fiber produces 155 AW (115 AW on the original V8) in MAX mode. The battery can also run 40 minutes (same as original V8) in the normal mode.\n|-\n|V10\n|\n|2018\n|The Dyson V10, launched in March 2018, is an upgrade version of previous V8 with a much more powerful motor (V8: 108,000 rpm / V10: 125,000 rpm). It has a much larger bin capacity, \"point and shoot\" hygienic bin emptying system, and a single \"all in one\" washable filter consisting of both the pre-motor and post motor filter. It has 3 motor speeds compared to 2 for the V6, V7 and V8.\n\nThere are two distinct models of the V10 with differing motors, filter assemblies and bin sizes. The V10 with larger bin gives 15.8 airwatts on low speed, the medium speed gives 33 airwatts, and the maximum speed gives 151 airwatts of suction. Run times are extended up to 60 minutes for speed setting 1 (15.8 Airwatts) with no motorised floorhead attached. The machine will run for 5 minutes in MAX speed (151 Airwatts) setting, 20 minutes in the second speed  (33 Airwatts) setting with the motorised large powerhead, and 30 minutes in the lowest speed (15.8 Airwatts) setting, with the motorised large powerhead fitted. A smaller version of the V10 with a V8 sized bin was released with a different motor with a maximum airwattage of 130 and smaller combined filter assembly. Like the V8, it has a wall mounting unit which it can be charged in, and charge time from empty is 3.5 hours. It comes with the same type of large motorised  powerheads as the V8, consisting of the direct drive motorhead, and the \"fluffy\" hard floor motorised head. Prior to its release, Dyson stopped developing new models of corded vacuums,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phelan|first1=David|title=Dyson Cyclone V10 Cordless Vacuum Is 'The Future', Dyson Stops Developing Corded Cleaners|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2018/03/06/dyson-declares-end-of-corded-vacuum-cleaners-says-new-powerful-cordless-is-the-future/#519e5a8a1138|website=Forbes}}</ref> this was also mentioned on Dyson's official website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dyson Cyclone V10|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308133345/https://www.dyson.com/sticks/dyson-cyclone-v10-overview.html|website=Dyson|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|V11\n|\n|2019\n|The Dyson V11 was released on the 27 March 2019. The Dyson V11 lineup includes the V11 Animal, Torque Drive, Absolute and Outsize models. Its head automatically adjusts to the floor type. The Torque Drive, Absolute, and Outsize models have Lcd screens that show the battery level. The operation time limits stay the same as of the former V10. The V11s run from $650-$1,300. The V11 Outsize is the strongest version, it has about the same bin size of their uprights. The V11 Outsize also has 2 click-in removable batteries that total up to 120 minutes of run time on eco mode with a non-motorized tool.\n\n|}\n\n==== Other ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model name\n!Image\n!Launch year\n!Description\n|-\n|360 Eye\n|[[File:Dyson 360 Eye (2017-07-29).jpg|frameless|194.983x194.983px]]\n|2014\n|The Dyson 360 Eye, a floor cleaning robot, uses a 360\u00b0 panoramic vision sensor and IR distance sensors to map a room and navigate, enabling it to perform a systematic cleaning pattern that covers the accessible floor area only once. Based off the DC06, the 360 Eye was launched in 2014, Dyson's initial entry into this market segment also features cyclonic dust separation, a Dyson digital motor V2 for high power suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brush-bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app.<ref name=\"360Eye\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|website=Dyson|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=2015-03-26|url-status=dead|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>\n|-\n|360 Heurist\n|\n|2019\n|The 360 Heurist is the upgraded version of the 360 Eye.

It was the first to use \"Dual Cyclone\" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.\n|-\n|DC01\n|''no image''\n|1993\n|The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, May 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented \"Dual Cyclone\" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.\nThe DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of \"brush control\" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration \u2013 standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The [[suction power]] of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.\n|-\n|DC03\n|''no image''\n|1997\n|The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9&nbsp;kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of [[HEPA]] filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball\n|-\n|DC04\n|''no image''\n|1998\n|The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushroll bar introduced on the DC03.\n|-\n|DC07\n|[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|frameless|261x261px]]\n|2001\n|The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a  cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.\nThe DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9&nbsp;kg.\nThe DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations. During the DC07 production run, in 2002, Dyson switched all manufacturing of its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new factory in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC14\n|''no image''\n|2004\n|The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. {{As of|2012|1}} listed as \"End of Line\" on Dyson Web site.\n|-\n|DC15\n|[[File:Dyson DC15.jpg|frameless|159x159px]]\n|2005\n|The DC15, known as ''The Ball'' was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal, and is loosely based on the DC14. It was the first vacuum to use a ball instead of existing static wheels, so as to make it more possible to steer and maneuver the cleaner around obstacles and corners, in conjunction with a [[universal joint]] mechanism on the cleaner head, by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the \"Ball\" system originated from the [[Ballbarrow]], James Dyson's first invention.\nThe DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the \"ball\".\n\nDue to its high launch price, its weight ({{Convert|8.6|kg|lb}}), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.\n|-\n|DC17\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allbrands.com/images/products_spec/L_17932_DC17animal.jpg|title=Level 3 Root Cyclone}}</ref> This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.\nThe second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with [[Europe]]an carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for [[North America]] with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.\n\nThe third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and [[titanium]] as the main colour for the entire machine.<ref>[http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17 Official DC17 page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201104533/http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17|date=February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem.

The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.\nThe ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu Official DC18 Page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034703/http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu|date=March 11, 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n|DC24\n|''no image''\n|2008\n|A small version of the DC25.

It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner.\u21b5Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely.

It was replaced by the DC41 in 2011. Like the DC15, it featured a suction motor located inside the ball, and separate brushroll motor which could be switched on and off independently of the suction motor, for using the vacuum cleaner on hard floors. It featured a post motor filter also inside the ball.\n|-\n|DC27\n|''no image''\n|''12 May 2009''\n|The DC27 is an update on the DC14.

Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red).\nThe DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model  more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.\nThe DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14.

The DC40 vacuum is Dyson's counterpart to the previously released DC41 Animal. The DC40 has Multifloor and Animal editions that utilise the Dyson ball technology. In 2015, following the introduction of the 2014 EU regulations, the DC40 was slightly modified to its powerhead and motor, whereby the motor was re-rated 700W, and the powerhead gained much more aggressive agitation and had the carpet guard strips removed. The DC40 (ERP) was replaced in 2017 by the Dyson Light Ball.\n|-\n|DC41\n|''no image''\n|2011\n|The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology. In 2015, the DC41 was updated to become the DC41 MK2, in which it was made compliant with the new 2014 EU directives for mains powered vacuum cleaners, and its motor changed to a 700W rated motor, and its powerhead was revised to take into account its lower powered suction motor. The DC41 MK2 was later renamed simply the \"Dyson Ball\", but is still known as DC41 MK2 in certain retail stores.\n|-\n|DC42\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC43\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC50\n|''no image''\n|2012\n|The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4&nbsp;kg (11.9&nbsp;lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47. In Canada it is called the DC51.

Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.\n\nThe DC02 was available in several special editions:\n*The [[De Stijl]] was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.\n*The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.\n*The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating [[Ranulph Fiennes|Sir Ranulph Fiennes's]] solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.\n*The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.\n|-\n|DC05\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a \"powernozzle\", a floor nozzle with a motorized brushroll bar for improved performance on carpets.\n|-\n|DC08\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new \"Animal\" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal from carpets and furnishings \u2013 they also came equipped with Hepa post-motor filters.\nNone of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output could drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.\n\nLower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better-suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose.\nThe DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19. Early in the production run of the DC08, in 2002, Dyson switched production of all its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new production facility in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC08T\n|''no image''\n|2003\n|Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'. Wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine. Launched in 2003\n|-\n|DC11\n|''no image''\n|2003\n|The DC11 was the first Dyson cylinder cleaner with Telescope wrap. Launched around 2003.\nIt had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.\n|-\n|DC12\n|''no image''\n|2005\n|Small cylinder machine released in Japan.

It weighs just 5.6&nbsp;kg and has an impressive 160 AirWatts suction power.\n|-\n|DC29\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|In [[Australia]] the DC29 is a cylinder model, an improved version of DC19. Very similar to DC19T2, the main differences being colour and tooling and non-HEPA machine. A HEPA filter is now included in 2012 'Multi-Floor' white models. In Canada, the DC29 is actually an upright model similar to the DC25.

Some versions of the V6, such as the Animal Extra and the Total Clean come with a 35W main powerhead with 75% more brushbar power than the standard head. The V6 develops 28 Airwatts of suction in its extended runtime mode, and 100 Airwatts of suction in its MAX mode, but runtime on a full charge in MAX mode is limited to 6 minutes. Runtime on a full charge using extended run time mode is 20 minutes with the non motorised tools attached, and 15 \u2013 17 minutes with the motorised heads attached. The V6 has been an immensely successful machine for Dyson, but did have issues such as a short runtime, a small dust cup capacity and less than easy dust cup removal, which were all addressed with the next generation of cordless models, the V8 and V7 ranges, which are due to replace the V6.\n|-\n|V8\n|2016\n|The Dyson V8 is an upgraded version of the V6 with better battery life (up to 40 mins without the brush heads),<ref name=\"homecleanexpert.com\">{{cite web|url=https://homecleanexpert.com/best-cordless-vacuum-for-hardwood-floors/#dysonV8|title=Cordless Vacuum Reviews|website=Home Clean Expert|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> a larger dust cup capacity, modifications to the debris emptying process (Called the \"Hygienic dirt ejection system\"), and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor HEPA filter. The V8 produces 22 Air watts of suction on normal (extended runtime) power (28 on the V6) and 115 airwatts in MAX mode (100 on the V6). Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors, which are a 50W main motorised powerhead with nylon and carbon fibre filaments for carpet use and hard floor dusting, a 20W \"Fluffy\" soft roller head for hard floor cleaning, and a 20W mini motorised head, with nylon bristles. Runtimes of the V8 in extended run time mode are 40 minutes with non motorised tools attached, 30 minutes with the fluffy head or mini motorised head attached, and 25 minutes with the main 50W powerhead attached. In MAX mode, the run times are approximately 7 minutes regardless of what tools are fitted. The V8 has full HEPA filtration provided by a removable and washable HEPA exhaust filter located on the back of the motor housing. The HEPA filter system was carried over from the V6 Absolute. The V8 also has a washable pre-motor filter so theoretically no filter replacements should be necessary during the life of the machine. The battery on the V8 is replaceable if necessary.\n|-\n|V7\n|2017\n|Based off the design and overall look of the Dyson V8, the V7, which was launched in 2017, uses a similar digital motor and accessories. However, being a less expensive model to purchase, it has some differences to the higher priced V8. The battery can only run the V7 for up to 30 minutes on a full charge, whereas the V8 can run for up to 40 minutes. The V7 is equipped with a 35W main motorised powerhead, compared to one with 50W on the V8, and also some models of V7 come with a 20W mini electric turbo tool of a slightly differing design to that of the V8. As it has a physically smaller battery than the V8, the V7 weighs less than the V8. In terms of performance, the V7 produces 21 Airwatts of suction on \"extended run time\" mode, compared to 22 on the V8 and 28 on the V6, and it produces 100 Airwatts (as on the V6) on Max mode, compared to 115 airwatts on the V8. Most models of V7 do not come equipped with a HEPA removable exhaust filter. Like the V8, the V7 incorporates the hygienic dirt ejection system, and the quick release \"red button\" tools system, and it also has the same, larger dust cup capacity of the V8. It also, like the V8, runs for up to 7 minutes, when put in Max mode.\n|-\n|V8 Carbon Fiber\n|\n|2017\n|The Dyson V8 Carbon Fiber is an upgrade version of V8 with a much more powerful motor. The V8 Carbon Fiber produces 155 AW (115 AW on the original V8) in MAX mode. The battery can also run 40 minutes (same as original V8) in the normal mode.\n|-\n|V10\n|\n|2018\n|The Dyson V10, launched in March 2018, is an upgrade version of previous V8 with a much more powerful motor (V8: 108,000 rpm / V10: 125,000 rpm). It has a much larger bin capacity, \"point and shoot\" hygienic bin emptying system, and a single \"all in one\" washable filter consisting of both the pre-motor and post motor filter. It has 3 motor speeds compared to 2 for the V6, V7 and V8.\n\nThere are two distinct models of the V10 with differing motors, filter assemblies and bin sizes. The V10 with larger bin gives 15.8 airwatts on low speed, the medium speed gives 33 airwatts, and the maximum speed gives 151 airwatts of suction. Run times are extended up to 60 minutes for speed setting 1 (15.8 Airwatts) with no motorised floorhead attached. The machine will run for 5 minutes in MAX speed (151 Airwatts) setting, 20 minutes in the second speed  (33 Airwatts) setting with the motorised large powerhead, and 30 minutes in the lowest speed (15.8 Airwatts) setting, with the motorised large powerhead fitted. A smaller version of the V10 with a V8 sized bin was released with a different motor with a maximum airwattage of 130 and smaller combined filter assembly. Like the V8, it has a wall mounting unit which it can be charged in, and charge time from empty is 3.5 hours. It comes with the same type of large motorised  powerheads as the V8, consisting of the direct drive motorhead, and the \"fluffy\" hard floor motorised head.

It was the first to use \"Dual Cyclone\" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.\n|-\n|DC01\n|''no image''\n|1993\n|The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, May 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented \"Dual Cyclone\" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.\nThe DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of \"brush control\" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration \u2013 standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The [[suction power]] of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.\n|-\n|DC03\n|''no image''\n|1997\n|The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9&nbsp;kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of [[HEPA]] filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball\n|-\n|DC04\n|''no image''\n|1998\n|The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushroll bar introduced on the DC03.\n|-\n|DC07\n|[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|frameless|261x261px]]\n|2001\n|The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a  cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.\nThe DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9&nbsp;kg.\nThe DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations. During the DC07 production run, in 2002, Dyson switched all manufacturing of its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new factory in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC14\n|''no image''\n|2004\n|The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. {{As of|2012|1}} listed as \"End of Line\" on Dyson Web site.\n|-\n|DC15\n|[[File:Dyson DC15.jpg|frameless|159x159px]]\n|2005\n|The DC15, known as ''The Ball'' was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal, and is loosely based on the DC14. It was the first vacuum to use a ball instead of existing static wheels, so as to make it more possible to steer and maneuver the cleaner around obstacles and corners, in conjunction with a [[universal joint]] mechanism on the cleaner head, by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the \"Ball\" system originated from the [[Ballbarrow]], James Dyson's first invention.\nThe DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the \"ball\".\n\nDue to its high launch price, its weight ({{Convert|8.6|kg|lb}}), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.\n|-\n|DC17\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allbrands.com/images/products_spec/L_17932_DC17animal.jpg|title=Level 3 Root Cyclone}}</ref> This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.\nThe second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with [[Europe]]an carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for [[North America]] with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.\n\nThe third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and [[titanium]] as the main colour for the entire machine.<ref>[http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17 Official DC17 page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201104533/http://www.dyson.com/store/productmodel.asp?model=DC17|date=February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n|-\n|DC18\n|''no image''\n|2006\n|The {{Convert|6.6|kg|lb}} Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.\nThe ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu Official DC18 Page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034703/http://www.dyson.co.uk/range/range_overview.asp?model=DC18&sinavtype=menu|date=March 11, 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n|DC24\n|''no image''\n|2008\n|A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 [[airwatt]]s of suction power. It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner.\u21b5Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely. Was superseded by the DC50 in November 2012\n|-\n|DC25\n|\"no image\"\n|2008\n|The DC25 was the replacement for the DC18, and was a scaled down, smaller version of the DC15 ball, and a larger version of the DC24. It was replaced by the DC41 in 2011. Like the DC15, it featured a suction motor located inside the ball, and separate brushroll motor which could be switched on and off independently of the suction motor, for using the vacuum cleaner on hard floors. It featured a post motor filter also inside the ball.\n|-\n|DC27\n|''no image''\n|''12 May 2009''\n|The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and \"root-cyclone\" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.<ref>[http://www.dyson.co.uk/Vacuumcleaners/Uprights/DC27/DC27-All-Floors.aspx Shop online for Dyson vacuum cleaners, fans, heaters, accessories and spare parts | Dyson Shop<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n|DC28\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar (\"Dyson Airmuscle\") controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.\n|-\n|DC33\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red).\nThe DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model  more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.\nThe DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14.  This unit has been discontinued as of July 2013. No replacement model has been announced.\n\nIn mainland Europe, the DC33c is a cylinder machine known as the \"Allergy Musclehead\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://manchestervacs.co.uk/DysonForum/index.php?topic=1280.0|title=When is a DC33 not a DC33?

The DC40 vacuum is Dyson's counterpart to the previously released DC41 Animal. The DC40 has Multifloor and Animal editions that utilise the Dyson ball technology. In 2015, following the introduction of the 2014 EU regulations, the DC40 was slightly modified to its powerhead and motor, whereby the motor was re-rated 700W, and the powerhead gained much more aggressive agitation and had the carpet guard strips removed. The DC40 (ERP) was replaced in 2017 by the Dyson Light Ball.\n|-\n|DC41\n|''no image''\n|2011\n|The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology. In 2015, the DC41 was updated to become the DC41 MK2, in which it was made compliant with the new 2014 EU directives for mains powered vacuum cleaners, and its motor changed to a 700W rated motor, and its powerhead was revised to take into account its lower powered suction motor. The DC41 MK2 was later renamed simply the \"Dyson Ball\", but is still known as DC41 MK2 in certain retail stores.\n|-\n|DC42\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC43\n|''no image''\n|''unknown''\n|A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.\n|-\n|DC50\n|''no image''\n|2012\n|The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4&nbsp;kg (11.9&nbsp;lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47. In Canada it is called the DC51.

Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.\n\nThe DC02 was available in several special editions:\n*The [[De Stijl]] was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.\n*The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.\n*The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating [[Ranulph Fiennes|Sir Ranulph Fiennes's]] solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.\n*The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.\n|-\n|DC05\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a \"powernozzle\", a floor nozzle with a motorized brushroll bar for improved performance on carpets.\n|-\n|DC08\n|''no image''\n|2002\n|The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new \"Animal\" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings \u2013 they also came equipped with Hepa post motor filters.\nNone of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.\n\nLower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose.\nThe DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19. Early in the production run of the DC08, in 2002, Dyson switched production of all its vacuum cleaners from Malmesbury, UK to a new production facility in Malaysia.\n|-\n|DC08T\n|''no image''\n|2003\n|Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'.

Launched around 2003.\nIt had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.\n|-\n|DC12\n|''no image''\n|2005\n|Small cylinder machine released in Japan.

In March 2014, the second-generation models of the Air Multiplier were acoustically re-engineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors, by improved airflow and a [[Helmholtz resonator]] to cancel a 10&nbsp;kHz whine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-04/16/dyson-fans/viewgallery/ytAqLTaKcCfPc|title=How Dyson made its bladeless fan 75 per cent quieter|last1=Stinson|first1=Liz}}</ref>\n\nSince the original release, Dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans (some with [[HEPA]] filters) based on its Air Multiplier design.
