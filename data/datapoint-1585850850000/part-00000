Similar to a migraine, sensitivity to light ([[photophobia]]) or noise ([[phonophobia]]) may occur during a CH.

CH attacks often awaken individuals from sleep.  Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks typically striking at a precise time of day each morning or night. The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement, or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body's \"biological clock\" and [[circadian rhythm]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0317167100001694 |pmid=11858532 |title=Cluster Headache: Evidence for a Disorder of Circadian Rhythm and Hypothalamic Function |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201340 |year=2014 |last1=Pringsheim |first1=Tamara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.2003.03055.x |pmid=12603650 |title=Clinical, Anatomical, and Physiologic Relationship Between Sleep and Headache |journal=Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=282\u201392 |year=2003 |last1=Dodick |first1=David W. |last2=Eross |first2=Eric J. |last3=Parish |first3=James M. }}</ref> In episodic cluster headache, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same time each day for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free period lasting weeks, months, or years.

His original paper describes the severity of the headaches as being able to take normal men and force them to attempt or complete suicide; his 1939 paper said:<blockquote>\"Our patients were disabled by the disorder and suffered from bouts of pain from two to twenty times a week. They had found no relief from the usual methods of treatment. Their pain was so severe that several of them had to be constantly watched for fear of suicide.

The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement, or dysfunction of the hypothalamus.
