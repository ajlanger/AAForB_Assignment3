He also encounters his ex-girlfriend Meena ([[Mala Sinha]]) from college and finds out that she has married a big publisher, Mr. Ghosh ([[Rehman (actor)|Rehman]]) for financial security. Ghosh hires him as a servant to find out more about him and Meena. A dead beggar to whom Vijay gave his coat and whom he tries to save unsuccessfully from the path of a running train is mistaken for Vijay. Gulabo goes to Ghosh and gets his poems published. Ghosh does so feeling he can exploit the poems and make a killing. The poems are very successful. However, Vijay is alive and in the hospital after the train mishap.\n\nGhosh and Shyam, Vijay's close friend, refuse to recognise him and he is committed to a mental asylum since he insists that he is Vijay and is thought to be mad. Vijay's brothers too are bought off by Ghosh not to recognise him and a memorial is held for the dead poet. Vijay, with the help of his friend Abdul Sattar ([[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]]) escapes from the mental asylum and reaches the memorial service, where he denounces this corrupt and materialistic world.

Abrar wanted the protagonist to accept and compromise with the prevailing material social reality; Guru Dutt insisted otherwise.\n* The song \"Sar jo tera chakraye\",  composed by S.D Burman, was based on a tune from the British Movie ''Harry Black'', which was later released in India as ''Harry Black and The Tiger''. S. D. Burman was initially not happy in copying a western tune, \"but later changed it so well that when the producer of ''Harry Black and the Tiger'' visited India, he heard the song and not only failed to recognize the tune, but commended Dada on it.\n(Source: \u2018Ten Years with Guru Dutt \u2013 Abrar Alvi\u2019s Journey\u2019 an authorised biography by Sathya Saran, Pages 71 and 72)\n\n* ''Pyaasa'' was to be made with actresses [[Nargis Dutt]] and [[Madhubala]] in the roles [[Mala Sinha]] and [[Waheeda Rehman]] played eventually.

Guru Dutt himself played and movie went on to become one of the most commercially successful movies of the year.\n* The popular song \"Hum Aapki Aankhon Mein\" was added to the movie on behest of distributors to bring some relief in rather pessimistic film. It was never planned in the original cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upperstall.com/films/pyaasa.html |title=Pyaasa |publisher=Upperstall.Com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>\n* After a slow opening, ''Pyaasa'' went on to be a major commercial success of the year. This gave Guru Dutt the confidence to make a repeat on a grand scale. However, ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'' went on to be a commercial disaster. The movie picked up a cult following the world over in the 1980s, long after Guru Dutt died.\n* Waheeda Rahman's role in ''Pyaasa'' was based on a real life character. [[Abrar Alvi]] and his friends were visiting Bombay and they decided to visit the red light area. Alvi got talking to a girl who called herself Gulabo. According to Alvi \"As I left, she thanked me in a broken voice, saying that it was the first time that she had been treated with respect, in a place where she heard only abuses.

Every frame was at a different angle and there was no stability. After several clean-ups, they managed to retrieve the actual content from the original camera negative, but it lacked clarity and depth. 45 restoration experts worked for almost 4 months on over 2 lakh (200,000) frames. The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35&nbsp;mm optical soundtrack.

Burman]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Geeta Dutt]] and [[Mohammed Rafi]] to produce one of the most lyrical [[Hindi]] musicals. ''Pyaasa'' marked the last collaboration of the long-lasting team of composer Burman and lyricist Ludhianvi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upperstall.com/films/pyaasa.html |title=Pyaasa |publisher=Upperstall.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref> Music expert Rajesh Subramanian reveals that Guru Dutt wanted Rafi to sing \"Jaane Woh Kaise Log\". But Burman had decided to record it in Hemant Kumar's voice. A major argument took place between the director, composer, writer Abrar Alvi and Geeta Dutt. Finally Dutt, who remained unconvinced, had to give in to the pressure.\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1 = Aaj Sajan Mohe Ang Lagalo | extra1 = [[Geeta Dutt]] | lyrics1 = | length1 = 04:56\n| title2 = Ham Aapki Aankhon Me | extra2 = Geeta Dutt, [[Mohammad Rafi]] | lyrics2 = | length2 = 05:42\n| title3 = Jaane Kya Tune Kahi | extra3 = Geeta Dutt | lyrics3 = | length3 = 04:10\n| title4 = Jaane Woh Kaise Log | extra4 = [[Hemant Kumar]] | lyrics4 = | length4 = 04:49\n| title5 = Sar Jo Tera Chakraye | extra5 = Mohammad Rafi | lyrics5 = | length5 = 04:33\n| title6 = Ye Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaye | extra6 = Mohammad Rafi | lyrics6 = | length6 = 05:08\n| title7 = Ye Hanste Huye Phool | extra7 = Mohammad Rafi | lyrics7 = | length7 = 07:50\n| title8 = Jinhen Naaz Hai Hind Par | extra8 = Mohammad Rafi | lyrics8 = | length8 = 06:06\n| title9 = Tang Aa Chuke Hain Kashm-e-Kashe Zindagi Se | extra9 = Mohammad Rafi | lyrics9 = | length9 = 04:23\n| title10 = Yeh Kooche Yeh Neelam Ghar Dilkashi Ke | extra10 = [[Mohammed Rafi]] | lyrics10 = | length10 = 03:11 \n}}\n\nIn 2004, as part of a ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' feature \"celebrating the relationship between cinema and music\", ''Pyaasa'' was named by [[Olivier Assayas]] as one of his favourites, going so far as to say that it was \"possibly one of the most remarkable transpositions of poetry on screen\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/filmmusic/favourites.php|title=The Best Music in Film|last=|first=|date=September 2004|website=British Film Institute|publisher=[[Sight & Sound]]|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The film then and now==\n* There was a debate between writer [[Abrar Alvi]] and [[Guru Dutt]] on film's ending. Abrar wanted the protagonist to accept and compromise with the prevailing material social reality; Guru Dutt insisted otherwise.\n* The song \"Sar jo tera chakraye\",  composed by S.D Burman, was based on a tune from the British Movie ''Harry Black'', which was later released in India as ''Harry Black and The Tiger''. S. D. Burman was initially not happy in copying a western tune, \"but later changed it so well that when the producer of ''Harry Black and the Tiger'' visited India, he heard the song and not only failed to recognize the tune, but commended Dada on it.\n(Source: \u2018Ten Years with Guru Dutt \u2013 Abrar Alvi\u2019s Journey\u2019 an authorised biography by Sathya Saran, Pages 71 and 72)\n\n* ''Pyaasa'' was to be made with actresses [[Nargis Dutt]] and [[Madhubala]] in the roles [[Mala Sinha]] and [[Waheeda Rehman]] played eventually. But the two actresses couldn't decide which role they wanted to play and Guru Dutt eventually opted for two then new actresses, Mala and Waheeda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/jun/23dinesh.htm |title=Pyaasa: Guru Dutt's masterpiece |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Guru Dutt]] wanted [[Dilip Kumar]] to play the leading role in the movie, which the tragedy king declined. Guru Dutt himself played and movie went on to become one of the most commercially successful movies of the year.\n* The popular song \"Hum Aapki Aankhon Mein\" was added to the movie on behest of distributors to bring some relief in rather pessimistic film. It was never planned in the original cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upperstall.com/films/pyaasa.html |title=Pyaasa |publisher=Upperstall.Com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>\n* After a slow opening, ''Pyaasa'' went on to be a major commercial success of the year. This gave Guru Dutt the confidence to make a repeat on a grand scale. However, ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'' went on to be a commercial disaster. The movie picked up a cult following the world over in the 1980s, long after Guru Dutt died.\n* Waheeda Rahman's role in ''Pyaasa'' was based on a real life character. [[Abrar Alvi]] and his friends were visiting Bombay and they decided to visit the red light area. Alvi got talking to a girl who called herself Gulabo. According to Alvi \"As I left, she thanked me in a broken voice, saying that it was the first time that she had been treated with respect, in a place where she heard only abuses. I used her exact words in the film.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.3to6.com/final_retro/legend.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128000147/http://www.3to6.com/final_retro/legend.htm |archive-date=28 January 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Guru Dutt and his movies, including ''Pyaasa'', have a large cult following in France and Germany.

As per the report, the original camera negative had come to them from the archives completely melted, with parts damaged or lost. Their biggest challenge was the flickering. Every frame was at a different angle and there was no stability. After several clean-ups, they managed to retrieve the actual content from the original camera negative, but it lacked clarity and depth. 45 restoration experts worked for almost 4 months on over 2 lakh (200,000) frames. The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35&nbsp;mm optical soundtrack. The company sent it to the [[72nd Venice International Film Festival]] held in 2015, where it competed with 20 other films and was selected to be screened as part of the Venice Classics section along with 11 other films from all over the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Pyaasa-goes-to-Venice/articleshow/48675601.cms |title=PYAASA GOES TO VENICE |newspaper=Mumbai Mirror |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Related films==\n* The theme of the film is similar to [[Kishore Sahu]]'s 1943 film ''[[Raja (1943 film)|Raja]]''.<ref name=\"Kavyamela\">[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/08/17/stories/2009081750630400.htm \"Kavyamela 1965\"].
