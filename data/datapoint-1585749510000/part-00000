When the placenta does not develop fully, the [[umbilical cord]] which transfers oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood to the placenta, cannot transfer enough oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, which will not be able to fully grow and develop. These conditions can result in heavy bleeding during delivery that can endanger mother and baby, although cesarean delivery can prevent most deaths.<ref name=\"varvadas\">{{cite journal |last1=Vardavas |first1=Constantine I. |last2=Chatzi |first2=Leda |last3=Patelarou |first3=Evridiki |last4=Plana |first4=Estel |last5=Sarri |first5=Katerina |last6=Kafatos |first6=Anthony |last7=Koutis |first7=Antonis D. |last8=Kogevinas |first8=Manolis |title=Smoking and smoking cessation during early pregnancy and its effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal growth |journal=European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=169 |issue=6 |pages=741\u20138 |year=2010 |pmid=19953266 |doi=10.1007/s00431-009-1107-9 }}</ref>\n\n====Pregnancy-induced hypertension====\nThere is limited evidence that smoking reduces the incidence of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Jun |last2=Zeisler |first2=Jonathan |last3=Hatch |first3=Maureen C. |last4=Berkowitz |first4=Gertrud |title=Epidemiology of Pregnancy-induced Hypertension |journal=Epidemiologic Reviews |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218\u201332 |year=1997 |pmid=9494784 |url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9494784 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a017954}}</ref> but not when the pregnancy is with more than one baby (i.e. it has no effect on twins etc.).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krotz |first1=Stephan |last2=Fajardo |first2=Javier |last3=Ghandi |first3=Sanjay |last4=Patel |first4=Ashlesha |last5=Keith |first5=Louis G. |title=Hypertensive Disease in Twin Pregnancies: A Review |journal=Twin Research |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=8\u201314 |year=2002 |pmid=11893276 |doi=10.1375/1369052022848 }}</ref>\n\n====Tic disorders====\nOther effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy include an increased risk for [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic disorder]]s. There is a link between chronic tic disorders, which include Tourette syndrome and other disorders like ADHD and OCD. According to a study published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, there is an especially high risk for children to be born with a chronic tic disorder if their mother is a heavy smoker. Heavy smoking can be defined as ten or more cigarettes each day. With this heavy smoking, researchers have found that there is an increase in risk as high as 66% for the child to have a chronic tic disorder. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also associated with psychiatric disorders such as ADHD. Concerning the increase risk for Tourette syndrome, there is an increased risk when two or more psychiatric disorders are also existent as maternal smoking leads to a higher chance of having a psychiatric disorder. \nE.

In 2004, 11.9% of babies born to smokers had low birthweight as compared to only 7.2% of babies born to nonsmokers.  More specifically, infants born to smokers weigh on average 200&nbsp;grams less than infants born to women who do not smoke.<ref name=\"CDC\">{{cite web |title=2004 Surgeon General's Report|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2004/pdfs/chapter5.pdf|website=Chapter 5 Reproductive Effects|publisher=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe nicotine in cigarette smoke constricts the blood vessels in the placenta and carbon monoxide, which is poisonous, enters the baby's bloodstream, replacing some of the valuable oxygen molecules carried by hemoglobin in the red blood cells. Moreover, because the fetus cannot breathe the smoke out, it has to wait for the placenta to clear it. These effects account for the fact that, on average, babies born to smoking mothers are usually born too early and have low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds), making it more likely the baby will become sick or die.\n<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Engebretson\n |first       = Joan\n |date        = 2013\n |title       = Materinity Nursing Care\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |location    = Canada\n |publisher   = Nelson Education, Ltd.\n |page        = 417\n |isbn        = 978-1-111-54311-2\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161029174838/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |archive-date = 29 October 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nPremature and low birth weight babies face an increased risk of serious health problems as newborns have chronic lifelong disabilities such as [[cerebral palsy]] (a set of motor conditions causing physical disabilities), [[mental retardation]] and learning problems.\n\n====Sudden infant death syndrome====\n[[Sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant that is unexplainable by the infant's history.  The death also remains unexplainable upon autopsy. Infants exposed to smoke, both during pregnancy and after birth, are found to be more at risk of SIDS due to the increased levels of nicotine often found in SIDS cases. Infants exposed to smoke during pregnancy are up to three times more likely to die of SIDS that children born to non-smoking mothers. {{Quantify|The likelihood goes from what to what?|date=January 2014}}<ref name=\"Bajanowski\">{{cite journal |last1=Bajanowski |first1=T. |last2=Brinkmann |first2=B. |last3=Mitchell |first3=E.

Recently the U.S. Public Health Service reported that if all pregnant women in the United States stopped smoking, there would be an estimated 11% reduction in stillbirths and a 5% reduction in newborn deaths.<ref name=\"CDC\"/>\n\n====Future obesity====\nA recent study has proposed that maternal smoking during pregnancy can lead to future teenage [[obesity]].  While no significant differences could be found between young teenagers with smoking mothers as compared to young teenagers with nonsmoking mothers, older teenagers with smoking mothers were found to have on average 26% more [[body fat]] and 33% more abdominal fat than similar aged teenagers with non-smoking mothers.  This increase in body fat may result from the effects of smoking during pregnancy, which is thought to impact fetal genetic programming in relation to obesity.  While the exact mechanism for this difference is currently unknown, studies conducted on animals have indicated that nicotine may affect brain functions that deal with eating impulses and energy metabolism.  These differences appear to have a significant effect on the maintenance of a healthy, normal weight.  As a result of this alteration to brain function, teenage obesity can in turn lead to a variety of health problems including [[diabetes]] (a condition in which the affected individual's blood glucose level is too high and the body is unable to regulate it), [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), and [[cardiovascular disease]] (any affliction related to the heart but most commonly the thickening of arteries due to excess fat build-up).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |title       = Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Childhood Obesity\n |access-date = 6 November 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104204414/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |archive-date = 4 November 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n====Future smoking habits====\nStudies indicate that smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of offspring beginning to smoke at an early age.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Quitting during pregnancy===\nQuitting smoking at any point during pregnancy is more beneficial than continuing to smoke throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy, especially if it is done within the [[first trimester]] (within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). A recent study suggests, however, that women who smoke anytime during the first trimester put their fetus at a higher risk for birth defects, particularly [[congenital heart defects]] (structural defects in the heart of an infant that can hinder blood flow) than women who have never smoked.  That risk only continues to increase the longer into the pregnancy a woman smokes, as well as the larger number of cigarettes she is smoking. This continued increase in risk throughout pregnancy means that it can still be beneficial for a pregnant woman to quit smoking for the remainder of her [[gestation period]].<ref name=\"varvadas\"/>\n\nThere are many resources to help pregnant women quit smoking such as counseling and drug therapies.  For non-pregnant smokers, an often-recommended aid to quitting smoking is through the use of [[nicotine replacement therapy]] in the form of patches, gum, inhalers, lozenges, sprays or sublingual tablets (tablets which you place under the tongue).  However, it is important to note that the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is questionable for pregnant women as these treatments still deliver nicotine to the child.  For some pregnant smokers, NRT might still be the most beneficial and helpful solution to quit smoking.  It is important that smokers talk to doctor to determine the best course of action on an individual basis.<ref name=\"march\">March, Penny D., and Carita Caple. \"Smoking Cessation and Pregnancy.\" Ed.

There is a link between chronic tic disorders, which include Tourette syndrome and other disorders like ADHD and OCD. According to a study published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, there is an especially high risk for children to be born with a chronic tic disorder if their mother is a heavy smoker. Heavy smoking can be defined as ten or more cigarettes each day. With this heavy smoking, researchers have found that there is an increase in risk as high as 66% for the child to have a chronic tic disorder. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also associated with psychiatric disorders such as ADHD. Concerning the increase risk for Tourette syndrome, there is an increased risk when two or more psychiatric disorders are also existent as maternal smoking leads to a higher chance of having a psychiatric disorder. \nE.

Moreover, because the fetus cannot breathe the smoke out, it has to wait for the placenta to clear it. These effects account for the fact that, on average, babies born to smoking mothers are usually born too early and have low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds), making it more likely the baby will become sick or die.\n<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Engebretson\n |first       = Joan\n |date        = 2013\n |title       = Materinity Nursing Care\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |location    = Canada\n |publisher   = Nelson Education, Ltd.\n |page        = 417\n |isbn        = 978-1-111-54311-2\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161029174838/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |archive-date = 29 October 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nPremature and low birth weight babies face an increased risk of serious health problems as newborns have chronic lifelong disabilities such as [[cerebral palsy]] (a set of motor conditions causing physical disabilities), [[mental retardation]] and learning problems.\n\n====Sudden infant death syndrome====\n[[Sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant that is unexplainable by the infant's history.

While no significant differences could be found between young teenagers with smoking mothers as compared to young teenagers with nonsmoking mothers, older teenagers with smoking mothers were found to have on average 26% more [[body fat]] and 33% more abdominal fat than similar aged teenagers with non-smoking mothers.  This increase in body fat may result from the effects of smoking during pregnancy, which is thought to impact fetal genetic programming in relation to obesity.  While the exact mechanism for this difference is currently unknown, studies conducted on animals have indicated that nicotine may affect brain functions that deal with eating impulses and energy metabolism.  These differences appear to have a significant effect on the maintenance of a healthy, normal weight.  As a result of this alteration to brain function, teenage obesity can in turn lead to a variety of health problems including [[diabetes]] (a condition in which the affected individual's blood glucose level is too high and the body is unable to regulate it), [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), and [[cardiovascular disease]] (any affliction related to the heart but most commonly the thickening of arteries due to excess fat build-up).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |title       = Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Childhood Obesity\n |access-date = 6 November 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104204414/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |archive-date = 4 November 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n====Future smoking habits====\nStudies indicate that smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of offspring beginning to smoke at an early age.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Quitting during pregnancy===\nQuitting smoking at any point during pregnancy is more beneficial than continuing to smoke throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy, especially if it is done within the [[first trimester]] (within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). A recent study suggests, however, that women who smoke anytime during the first trimester put their fetus at a higher risk for birth defects, particularly [[congenital heart defects]] (structural defects in the heart of an infant that can hinder blood flow) than women who have never smoked.  That risk only continues to increase the longer into the pregnancy a woman smokes, as well as the larger number of cigarettes she is smoking. This continued increase in risk throughout pregnancy means that it can still be beneficial for a pregnant woman to quit smoking for the remainder of her [[gestation period]].<ref name=\"varvadas\"/>\n\nThere are many resources to help pregnant women quit smoking such as counseling and drug therapies.  For non-pregnant smokers, an often-recommended aid to quitting smoking is through the use of [[nicotine replacement therapy]] in the form of patches, gum, inhalers, lozenges, sprays or sublingual tablets (tablets which you place under the tongue).  However, it is important to note that the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is questionable for pregnant women as these treatments still deliver nicotine to the child.  For some pregnant smokers, NRT might still be the most beneficial and helpful solution to quit smoking.  It is important that smokers talk to doctor to determine the best course of action on an individual basis.<ref name=\"march\">March, Penny D., and Carita Caple. \"Smoking Cessation and Pregnancy.\" Ed.

There is evidence that breastfeeding offers protection against many [[infectious diseases]], especially diarrhea. Even in babies exposed to the harmful effects of nicotine through breast milk, the likelihood of acute respiratory illness is significantly diminished when compared to infants whose mothers smoked but were formula fed.<ref name=\"menella\">{{cite journal |last1=Mennella |first1=J.
