Named for [[Edward Blyth]], the species has also been known as ''Alcedo grandis'' and as the great blue kingfisher. Between {{convert|22|and|23|cm|in|frac=8}} long, the kingfisher has deep rufous underparts with a blackish blue breast patch, and brilliant cobalt blue or azure upperparts, tinged with purple. The wings are a dark blackish green, with blue speckles and tips to some of the feathers. The bill of the male is entirely black, while the female has a dark red lower mandible. The species is distinguished from the similar [[blue-eared kingfisher]] (''Alcedo meninting'') and [[common kingfisher]] (''Alcedo atthis'') by its greater size, heavy black bill, and dark [[Lore (anatomy)|lores]].\n\nThe species breeds between the months of March and June. It builds nests at the end of tunnels dug in the banks of streams or ravines. Four to six eggs are laid, with both sexes incubating. A shy bird, it frequents small waterways, feeding on fish and insects caught by diving from a shrub close to the water. It is found along streams in evergreen forest and adjacent open country between {{convert|200|and|1200|m|sigfig=2}}, mainly between {{convert|400|and|1000|m|sigfig=2}}. The species ranges from Nepal through India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Even within its preferred habitat the density of the species is low, and the population, though not thoroughly surveyed, is believed to be small, and declining further. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] classifies it as \"near threatened\".\n\n==Taxonomy==\nBlyth's kingfisher was [[Species description|described]] by the English zoologist [[Edward Blyth]] in 1845 and given the [[binomial name]] ''Alcedo grandis''.<ref>{{ cite journal | last=Blyth | first=Edward | author-link=Edward Blyth | year=1845 | title=Notices and descriptions of various new or little known species of birds | journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=173\u2013212 [190] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/40131961 }}</ref> Unfortunately, this name was preoccupied as it had already been introduced for another species by the German naturalist [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] in his ''Systema naturae'' of 1788.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Gmelin | first=Johann Friedrich | author-link=Johann Friedrich Gmelin| year=1788 | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae : secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis | edition=13th | volume=Volume 1, Part 1 | language=Latin | place=Lipsiae [Leipzig] | publisher=Georg.

In China, the species is estimated to have fewer than 100 breeding pairs.<ref name=IUCN/> The species occurs at a low density even within a favorable habitat. The habitats it favors are being degraded and fragmented by human activity. Other potential threats to the species include water pollution in the rivers it inhabits and anthropogenic disturbance such as deforestation.<ref name=IUCN/> No specific conservation actions are known to have been taken to protect the species. Due to the presence of human disturbance, its population is thought to be in slow decline. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] categorizes the species as \"near threatened\"; it has previously classified the species as \"vulnerable.\"<ref name=IUCN/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alcedo hercules|Blyth's Kingfisher}}\n{{Wikispecies|Alcedo hercules|Blyth's Kingfisher}}\n* [http://orientalbirdimages.org/search.php?Bird_ID=413 Oriental Bird Images: ''Blyth's Kingfisher'']  Selected images\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q832565}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:kingfisher, Blyth's}}\n[[Category:Alcedo|Blyth's kingfisher]]\n[[Category:Birds of Hainan]]\n[[Category:Birds of Northeast India]]\n[[Category:Birds of Southeast Asia]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1917|Blyth's kingfisher]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toLores(link changed toLore (anatomy)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blyth%27s_kingfisher"}
