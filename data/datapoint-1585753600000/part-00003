From the classical perspective however, Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria, like Arabia and Mesopotamia, was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and [[Western Europe]]an usage, and also in the [[Syriac literature]] of some of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian churches]], from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christian Arab]]ic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in [[Muslim]] Arabic usage.}}</ref> After [[World War I]], the name 'Syria' was applied to the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]], and the contemporaneous but short-lived [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main|Name of Syria}}\n\n===Syria===\nThe oldest attestation of the name 'Syria' is from the 8th century BC in a bilingual inscription in [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].

Sometime between 330 and 350 (likely c. 341), the province of ''[[Euphratensis]]'' was created out of the territory of Syria Coele and the former realm of Commagene, with [[Hierapolis]] as its capital.<ref>{{cite book | first = Alexander (Ed.) | last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=748}}</ref>\n\nAfter c. 415 Syria Coele was further subdivided into Syria I, with the capital remaining at [[Antioch]], and Syria II or Salutaris, with capital at [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]] on the [[Orontes River]].

The kingdom claimed the entire region of Syria whilst exercising control over only the inland region known as OETA East. This led to the acceleration of the declaration of the French [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] and British [[Mandate for Palestine]] at the 19\u201326 April 1920 [[San Remo conference]], and subsequently the [[Franco-Syrian War]], in July 1920, in which French armies [[Battle of Maysalun|defeated]] the newly proclaimed kingdom and [[Siege of Damascus (1920)|captured]] Damascus, aborting the Arab state.<ref>[[Itamar Rabinovich]], Symposium: The Greater-Syria Plan and the Palestine Problem in The Jerusalem Cathedra (1982), p. 262.</ref> \n\nThereafter, the French general [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], in breach of the conditions of the mandate, subdivided the [[French Mandate of Syria]] into six states. They were the states of [[State of Damascus|Damascus]] (1920), [[State of Aleppo|Aleppo]] (1920), [[Alawite State]] (1920), [[Jabal al-Druze (state)|Jabal Druze]] (1921), the autonomous [[State of Hatay|Sanjak of Alexandretta]] (1921) (modern-day [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] in Turkey), and [[Greater Lebanon]] (1920) which later became the modern country of [[Lebanon]].\n\n===In pan-Syrian nationalism===\n{{See also|Ba'athism|Fertile Crescent Plan|Kingdom of Syria}}\n[[File:Greater_Syria_Map.png|thumb|[[Antoun Saadeh]]'s [[Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party|SSNP]] map of a \"Natural Syria\", based on the [[Name of Syria|etymological connection between the name \"Syria\" and \"Assyria\"]]]]\nThe boundaries of the region have changed throughout history, and were last defined in modern times by the proclamation of the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Syria and subsequent definition by French and British mandatory agreement. The area was passed to French and British Mandates following [[World War I]] and divided into [[Greater Lebanon]], various Syrian-mandate states, [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]]. The Syrian-mandate states were gradually unified as the [[State of Syria (1924\u201330)|State of Syria]] and finally became the independent [[Syria]] in 1946.

In the [[19th century]] the name Syria was revived in its modern Arabic form to denote the whole of [[Bilad al-Sham]], either as ''Suriyah'' or the modern form ''Suriyya'', which eventually replaced the Arabic name of Bilad al-Sham.<ref name=\"Salibi2003\">{{cite book |author=Kamal S.

From the classical perspective however, Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria, like Arabia and Mesopotamia, was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and [[Western Europe]]an usage, and also in the [[Syriac literature]] of some of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian churches]], from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christian Arab]]ic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in [[Muslim]] Arabic usage.}}</ref> After [[World War I]], the name 'Syria' was applied to the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]], and the contemporaneous but short-lived [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main|Name of Syria}}\n\n===Syria===\nThe oldest attestation of the name 'Syria' is from the 8th century BC in a bilingual inscription in [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].

The kingdom claimed the entire region of Syria whilst exercising control over only the inland region known as OETA East. This led to the acceleration of the declaration of the French [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] and British [[Mandate for Palestine]] at the 19\u201326 April 1920 [[San Remo conference]], and subsequently the [[Franco-Syrian War]], in July 1920, in which French armies [[Battle of Maysalun|defeated]] the newly proclaimed kingdom and [[Siege of Damascus (1920)|captured]] Damascus, aborting the Arab state.<ref>[[Itamar Rabinovich]], Symposium: The Greater-Syria Plan and the Palestine Problem in The Jerusalem Cathedra (1982), p. 262.</ref> \n\nThereafter, the French general [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], in breach of the conditions of the mandate, subdivided the [[French Mandate of Syria]] into six states.
