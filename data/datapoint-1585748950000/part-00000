K. McDougall''', was an [[Australia]]n politician, poet and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] activist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcDougall was born at [[Learmonth, Victoria]] to farmer Donald McDougall and Margaret, n\u00e9e Keith. He attended [[Rossbridge]] Common School but left school at the age of 13 to assist on the family farm. His education continued informally, however, and began to develop an interest in politics, having rejected the [[Presbyterian]] ministry.\n\n==Politics==\n\nMcDougall joined the [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] branch of the Political Labor Council in 1903, becoming president in 1904. He stood twice for [[Shire of Ararat|Ararat Shire]] Council, succeeding in 1904. In [[1906 Australian federal election|1906]] he was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] for the seat of [[Division of Wannon|Wannon]] after a successful campaign targeting the anti-union leanings of the [[Anti-Socialist Party|Anti-Socialist]] sitting member, [[Arthur Robinson (Australian politician)|Arthur Robinson]]. He rarely spoke in [[Australian Parliament|Parliament]], but did considerable work for his constituency. McDougall also became associated with [[King O'Malley]] and his group of Labor members. McDougall was defeated in Wannon in [[1913 Australian federal election|1913]], largely due to a general swing against Labor and a redistribution, and returned to his farm, running unsuccessfully for [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] in 1914 and [[Division of Grampians|Grampians]] in 1915 and 1917.\n\n==Later life==\n\nMcDougall was a prolific contributor to Labor press, denouncing [[capitalism]] as well as those Labor members of whom he disapproved, including [[Andrew Fisher]], [[Chris Watson]], [[Ted Theodore]], [[James Scullin]], [[Billy Hughes]] and [[Joseph Lyons]]. Many of these contributions were submitted in verse; five books of McDougall's verse were published, including ''The trend of the ages''<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article145796284 |title=A Labor singer. |newspaper=[[The Australian Worker]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=25 July 1923 |access-date=29 February 2020 |page=7 |via=Trove }} </ref> and ''Grass and gossamer, and other verses'' (1930).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article249967189 |title=Grass and gossamer |newspaper=Labor Call |location=Victoria, Australia |date=31 July 1930 |access-date=29 February 2020 |page=11 |via=Trove }} </ref>\n\nMcDougall's poem ''The White Man's Burden'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129500099 |title=Opinions of Mr M'DOUGALL on the war. |newspaper=Stawell News and Pleasant Creek Chronicle |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 February 1915 |access-date=29 February 2020 |page=3 |via=Trove }} </ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article180815761 |title=Tar and feathers. |newspaper=[[Glen Innes Examiner]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 December 1919 |access-date=29 February 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }} </ref> which denounced [[war]], was used by the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] in the [[1919 Australian federal election|1919 election]] as evidence of Labor's contempt for servicemen.
