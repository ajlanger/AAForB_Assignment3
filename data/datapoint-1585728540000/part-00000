This, and another [[antifolate]] drug, [[methotrexate]] used by Dr. Farber, were discovered and supplied by Dr. [[Yellapragada Subbarow]], Director, Research at Lederle Co. at Pearl River, NY.\n* 1954: Farber and his colleagues achieve the first remissions of [[Wilms' tumor]], a common form of childhood cancer, and boost cure rates from 40 percent to 85 percent.\n* 1976: Researchers at the Sidney Farber Cancer Center (now Dana-Farber) develop a new treatment for [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] that produces the first complete remissions of the disease in up to half of all patients.\n* 1978: Institute investigators develop combination chemotherapy for soft-tissue [[sarcoma]]s resulting in a 50-percent response rate.\n* 1980: Dana-Farber president [[Baruj Benacerraf]] receives the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of the [[major histocompatibility complex]], which enables the immune system to recognize [[antigens]].\n* 1982: Dana-Farber researchers develop and apply the [[CA-125]] blood test for [[ovarian cancer]]. They also are among the first to suspect a relationship between the retrovirus that causes [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1|human T-cell leukemia]] (HTLV-1) and that which causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] ([[Subtypes of HIV|HIV-1]]).\n* 1991: Dana-Farber investigators help introduce the use of naturally occurring [[growth hormone]]s following high-dose chemotherapy, making [[bone marrow transplantation]] safer and more effective.\n* 1993: Dana-Farber investigators discover the gene that increases the risk for a common type of [[colon cancer]]. The [[DNA mismatch repair|''MSH2'']] gene and later the [[DNA mismatch repair|''MLH1'']] gene (also by DFCI investigators) are linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ([[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer|HNPCC]]).\n* 1996: Institute researchers dramatically advance the understanding of how HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, replicates and infects healthy cells. ''Science'' magazine heralds this discovery as its \"Breakthrough of the Year\".\n* 1998: A drug called [[imatinib]] (Gleevec), the early work for which was done at Dana-Farber, achieves striking success in many patients with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]].\n* 1999: Working with colleagues at other hospitals, Dana-Farber scientists begin the first human studies of [[endostatin]], one of a new generation of compounds that arrest or shrink tumors by shutting off their blood supply.\n* 2002: Dana-Farber researchers find that Gleevec, a targeted therapy that achieved striking success against chronic myelogenous leukemia, can shrink and even eliminate tumors in some patients with a rare and otherwise incurable digestive-tract cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\n* 2003: Scientists at Dana-Farber and the [[Whitehead Institute]] find a gene \"signature\" in several types of tumors that suggests they are likely to spread to other parts of the body, potentially leading to tests for determining whether tumors have the potential to metastasize.\n* 2005: Dana-Farber scientists report that the drug [[gefitinib]] (Iressa) produces dramatic benefits in [[non-small cell lung cancer]] patients who carry an abnormal version of a key protein, a potentially life-saving discovery for tens of thousands of patients around the world every year.\n* 2019: Dana-Farber physician and researcher [[William Kaelin Jr.]] receives the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for \"discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\n== Patient care ==\nDana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) is a collaboration between Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] to care for adults with cancer.
