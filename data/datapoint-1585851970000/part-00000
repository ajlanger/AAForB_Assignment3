Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \"the community had been denied registration as a religion\" and that \"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also. Most human rights and religious freedom activists have seen this denial of registration to the Ahmadi community as an exception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=874|title=Bulgaria: Ahmadis barred \"because it is against the religions that people follow here\"|publisher=Forum18.org|accessdate=2016-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193647/http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=874|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\n{{main|Ahmadiyya in Egypt}}\nThere has been a recent rise of persecution of Ahmadis in Egypt.

Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \"the community had been denied registration as a religion\" and that \"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also.
