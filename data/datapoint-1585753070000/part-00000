Believing Raquel and the Shadow Cabinet agents have kidnapped former ''[[Justice League International]]'' member [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] (Dr. Light II), Batman immediately attempts to strike Rocket with a [[batarang]], which she easily deflects with her powers. After berating Batman and informing him that Kimiyo is unharmed, Rocket accompanies the Shadow Cabinet Agents and JLA members to the [[Justice League Satellite]], where they aid Icon, [[Hawkman]], and the rest of the Shadow Cabinet and JLA members in a battle with the [[Shadow Thief]].
