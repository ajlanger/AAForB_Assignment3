Lofoten is known for a distinctive scenery with dramatic mountains and peaks, open sea and sheltered [[bay]]s, beaches and untouched lands. Its capital and largest town, [[Leknes|Leknes]], lies approximately 169 km inside the [[Arctic Circle]], or approximately 2,420 km away from the [[North Pole]], thus making Lofoten one of the world's northernmost populated regions. Though lying within the Arctic Circle, the [[archipelago]] experiences one of the world's largest elevated temperature anomalies relative to its [[Polar region|high]] [[latitude]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Lofoten'' ({{lang-non|L\u00f3f\u00f3t}}) was the original name of the island [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8ya]]. The first element is ''l\u00f3'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"[[lynx]]\") and the last element is derived from Norse ''f\u00f3tr'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"foot\"), as the shape of the island must have been compared with that of a lynx's foot. (The old name of the neighbouring island [[Flakstad\u00f8ya]] was ''Vargf\u00f3t'', \"[[wolf]]'s foot\", from ''vargr'' \"wolf\". See also [[Ofoten]].)\n\n== History ==\n[[File:(Raftsund, Lofoten, Digermulen, Norway) (LOC) (3175025812).jpg|thumb|\"Raftsund, Lofoten, Digermulen, Norway\", c. 1890\u20131900.]]\n\"There is evidence of human settlement extending back at least 11,000 years in Lofoten, and the earliest archaeological sites ... are only about 5,500 years old, at the transition from the early to [[late Stone Age]].\" [[Iron Age]] agriculture, livestock, and significant human habitation can be traced back to {{nowrap|c. 250 BC.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert M. |last=D'Anjou |first2=Raymond S. |last2=Bradley |first3=Nicholas L. |last3=Balascio |first4=David B. |last4=Finkelstein |title=Climate impacts on human settlement and agricultural activities in northern Norway revealed through sediment biogeochemistry |journal=PNAS |volume=109 |issue=50 |pages=20332\u201320337 |year=2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1212730109 }}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Lofoten Svolvear F\u00e4hrhafen Ausfahrt.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Svolv\u00e6r in Lofoten, Norway.

It existed in the early [[Viking Age]], maybe earlier, and was located on the southern coast on eastern Lofoten, near today's village [[Kabelv\u00e5g]] in [[V\u00e5gan]] municipality. However, the [[Lofotr Viking Museum]] with the reconstructed 83-metre-long [[Mead hall|longhouse]] (the largest known) is located near Borg on [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]], which has many archeological finds from the Iron Age and Viking Age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/norway15moneng.htm|title=Norway \u2013 Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y \u2013 Vendalsjord|author=|date=|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have for more than 1,000 years been the centre of great [[cod]] [[fisheries]], especially in winter, when the cod migrates south from the [[Barents Sea]] and gathers in Lofoten to [[spawn (biology)|spawn]]. [[Bergen]] in southwestern Norway was for a long time the hub for further export south to different parts of Europe, particularly so when trade was controlled by the [[Hanseatic League]]. In the lowland areas, particularly Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y, agriculture plays a significant role, as it has done since the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nLofotr was originally the name of the island of Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y only. Later it became the name of the chain of islands. The chain of islands with its pointed peaks looks like a lynx foot from the mainland. In Norwegian, it is always a singular. Another name one might come across, is \"Lofotveggen\" or the Lofoten wall. The archipelago looks like a closed wall when seen from elevated points around [[Bod\u00f8]] or when arriving from the sea, some {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} long, and {{convert|800|-|1,000|m|abbr=off}} high.\n\nIn March 1941 the islands were raided by [[British Commandos]] during [[Operation Claymore]], and in a subsequent [[Operation Anklet|diversionary attack]] to support the [[Operation Archery|Vaagso raid]] in December.\n\nAs of 2017, the islands attract one million tourists a year.<ref name=\"vecono\" >{{cite news|title=Why Norway may leave $65bn worth of oil in the ground|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/08/economist-explains-12|work=[[The Economist]]|author=M.F.|date=29 Aug 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Map-of-Lofoten-and-Vesteraalen.svg|thumb|Lofoten and [[Vester\u00e5len]].]]\nLofoten is located at the [[68th parallel north|68th]] and [[69th parallel north|69th parallels north]] of the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[North Norway]]. It is known for its natural environment within Norway. Lofoten encompasses the municipalities of [[V\u00e5gan]], [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]], [[Flakstad]], [[Moskenes]], [[V\u00e6r\u00f8y]], and [[R\u00f8st]].

The total land area amounts to {{convert|1,227|km2|abbr=off}}, and the population totals 24,500.\nMany will argue that Hinn\u00f8ya, the northern part of [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] and several hundred smaller islands, skerries and rocks to the east of [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] are also part of the Lofoten complex. Historically, the territorial definition of Lofoten has changed significantly. Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago lies the vast, open [[Vestfjorden]], and to the north is [[Vester\u00e5len]]. The principal towns in Lofoten are [[Leknes]] in Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y and [[Svolv\u00e6r]] in V\u00e5gan. The main islands are joined to each other and the mainland by road bridges.

Lofoten is known for a distinctive scenery with dramatic mountains and peaks, open sea and sheltered [[bay]]s, beaches and untouched lands. Its capital and largest town, [[Leknes|Leknes]], lies approximately 169 km inside the [[Arctic Circle]], or approximately 2,420 km away from the [[North Pole]], thus making Lofoten one of the world's northernmost populated regions. Though lying within the Arctic Circle, the [[archipelago]] experiences one of the world's largest elevated temperature anomalies relative to its [[Polar region|high]] [[latitude]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Lofoten'' ({{lang-non|L\u00f3f\u00f3t}}) was the original name of the island [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8ya]]. The first element is ''l\u00f3'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"[[lynx]]\") and the last element is derived from Norse ''f\u00f3tr'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"foot\"), as the shape of the island must have been compared with that of a lynx's foot. (The old name of the neighbouring island [[Flakstad\u00f8ya]] was ''Vargf\u00f3t'', \"[[wolf]]'s foot\", from ''vargr'' \"wolf\".

However, the [[Lofotr Viking Museum]] with the reconstructed 83-metre-long [[Mead hall|longhouse]] (the largest known) is located near Borg on [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]], which has many archeological finds from the Iron Age and Viking Age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/norway15moneng.htm|title=Norway \u2013 Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y \u2013 Vendalsjord|author=|date=|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have for more than 1,000 years been the centre of great [[cod]] [[fisheries]], especially in winter, when the cod migrates south from the [[Barents Sea]] and gathers in Lofoten to [[spawn (biology)|spawn]]. [[Bergen]] in southwestern Norway was for a long time the hub for further export south to different parts of Europe, particularly so when trade was controlled by the [[Hanseatic League]]. In the lowland areas, particularly Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y, agriculture plays a significant role, as it has done since the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nLofotr was originally the name of the island of Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y only. Later it became the name of the chain of islands. The chain of islands with its pointed peaks looks like a lynx foot from the mainland. In Norwegian, it is always a singular. Another name one might come across, is \"Lofotveggen\" or the Lofoten wall. The archipelago looks like a closed wall when seen from elevated points around [[Bod\u00f8]] or when arriving from the sea, some {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} long, and {{convert|800|-|1,000|m|abbr=off}} high.\n\nIn March 1941 the islands were raided by [[British Commandos]] during [[Operation Claymore]], and in a subsequent [[Operation Anklet|diversionary attack]] to support the [[Operation Archery|Vaagso raid]] in December.\n\nAs of 2017, the islands attract one million tourists a year.<ref name=\"vecono\" >{{cite news|title=Why Norway may leave $65bn worth of oil in the ground|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/08/economist-explains-12|work=[[The Economist]]|author=M.F.|date=29 Aug 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Map-of-Lofoten-and-Vesteraalen.svg|thumb|Lofoten and [[Vester\u00e5len]].]]\nLofoten is located at the [[68th parallel north|68th]] and [[69th parallel north|69th parallels north]] of the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[North Norway]]. It is known for its natural environment within Norway. Lofoten encompasses the municipalities of [[V\u00e5gan]], [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]], [[Flakstad]], [[Moskenes]], [[V\u00e6r\u00f8y]], and [[R\u00f8st]].

The total land area amounts to {{convert|1,227|km2|abbr=off}}, and the population totals 24,500.\nMany will argue that Hinn\u00f8ya, the northern part of [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] and several hundred smaller islands, skerries and rocks to the east of [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] are also part of the Lofoten complex. Historically, the territorial definition of Lofoten has changed significantly. Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago lies the vast, open [[Vestfjorden]], and to the north is [[Vester\u00e5len]]. The principal towns in Lofoten are [[Leknes]] in Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y and [[Svolv\u00e6r]] in V\u00e5gan. The main islands are joined to each other and the mainland by road bridges.

It has 24&nbsp;hours of daylight in the summer and has Alpine-style ridges, summits and [[glacier]]s, but at a height of less than {{convert|1,200|m|abbr=off}}. The main centre for rock climbing is [[Henningsv\u00e6r]] on Austv\u00e5g\u00f8ya.\n\nThe main areas for mountaineering and climbing are on [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] and [[Moskenes\u00f8ya]]. Moskenes\u00f8ya features remote and serious mountaineering whereas [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] is very popular area for rock climbing. For more information, see the walking guide by Dyer and the rock climbing guidebook by Craggs and Enevold (see references).\n\n=== Football ===\nLofoten has one of the world's most unique football pitches. The pitch rests on a rocky islet which has no actual seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amusingplanet.com/2017/05/this-football-stadium-in-henningsvr.html}}</ref> An image of Lofoten featuring the uniquely situated football pitch has been used as the start up screen image for Microsoft Windows.\n\n=== Surfing ===\n[[Unstad]] is one of its better known locations for surfing. Every September surfers from around the world visit to compete in the Lofoten Masters.<ref name=NRK>{{cite web|title=Ekstremsurferne Inntar Lofoten|url=http://www.nrk.no/nordland/ekstremsurferne-inntar-lofoten-1.8268111|website=nrk.no|publisher=Opphavsrett NRK}}</ref>\n\n=== Cycling ===\n[[File:Nusfjord.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Nusfjord]].]]\nThere is a well marked cycling route that goes from [[\u00c5, Moskenes|\u00c5]] in the south and continues past [[Fiskeb\u00f8l]] in the north. The route is part public road, part cycle-path with the option to bypass all of the tunnels by either cycle-path (tunnels through mountains) or boat. Traffic is generally light, although in July there may be a lot of [[campervan]]s. Some of the more remote sections are on gravel roads. There is a dedicated cycling ferry which sails between [[Ballstad]] and [[Nusfjord]], allowing cyclists to avoid the long, steep [[Nappstraum]] tunnel. The route hugs the coastline for most of its length where it is generally flat. As it turns inland through the mountain passes there are a couple of {{convert|300|-|400|m|ft|lk=out|adj=on|abbr=off}} climbs.\n\nThe [[Lofoten Insomnia Cycling Race]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lofoteninsomnia.no|title=Zalaris Lofoten Insomnia|author=|date=|publisher=}}</ref> takes place every year around midsummer, possible in the midnight sun, but certainly in 24-hour daylight, along the whole Lofoten archipelago.\n\nThe [[Arctic Race of Norway]], the world\u2019s northernmost professional stage race on road bike which takes place every year in Northern Norway, crossed the Lofoten islands during its first edition in August 2013.

Late August near [[Eggum]], [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]].]]\nThe European road [[European route E10|E10]] connects the larger islands of Lofoten with bridges and undersea tunnels. The E10 road also connects Lofoten to the mainland of Norway through the [[Lofast]] road connection, which was officially opened on 1 December 2007.
