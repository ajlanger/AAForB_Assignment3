It is located {{convert|212|km}} north-east of [[Ushuaia]] the capital of the province.

R\u00edo Grande was founded on July 11, 1921, when the central government issued a decree recognising this locality as the \"Agricultural Colony of R\u00edo Grande\".\n\nIn the beginning, the land was subdivided among a few families, owning large estates until the [[agrarian reform]] of 1925. Cattle raising became one of the most important economic activities in the area.\n\nTo promote industrial development, Tierra del Fuego is excluded from VAT and federal income tax. As a result, several manufacturing companies, particularly those involving electronic products, have opened factories in this city. The population grew as a result of the television set production and assembly plants which opened in the 1980s, notably by [[ITT Inc.|ITT]]. One of the most rapidly growing sectors is the production of [[laptop]]s and [[netbook]]s. These products were totally imported until 2006 but by 2010, and due to initiatives under the Kirchner administrations, 42% of the Argentine market for these goods was supplied by firms established in R\u00edo Grande and [[Vicente L\u00f3pez, Buenos Aires|Vicente L\u00f3pez]].
