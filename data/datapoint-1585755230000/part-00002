A teacher fresh out of training. He was allocated Class 5C, the most unruly form in the \nschool, at the beginning of term. At first relations were frosty between Bernard and Class 5C, but gradually Bernard gained the respect \nof his class and the rest of the staff. As the series progressed, he is shown to be a caring and very fair teacher and would always defend \nhis form, regardless of how much evidence is put towards them.\n\nIn the movie, he met air stewardess Penny Wheeler. After misinterpreting a 'few white lies' made by a pupil accidentally left behind, Penny   \nbegan to take shine to Bernard. After a period of dating, Bernard attempted to propose to Penny but she already said yes before he could complete his sentence and they got engaged and later married.\n\nShortly after Bernard got married, a new term started and was allocated Class 4C but it was not quite the same as 5C. He later resigned and left.\n\n'''Mr Norman Potter''' (Portrayed by [[Deryck Guyler]]). The pedantic and officious school caretaker. He claimed to have been a Desert Rat and constantly complains about the unruly behaviour of Hedge's class 5C. He is fiercely loyal (to the point of sycophancy) to the headmaster but a thorn in the side of the rest of the staff. His various comeuppances provide much of the ongoing humour of the sitcom.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of films based on British sitcoms]]\n* [[Welcome Back, Kotter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{British Comedy Guide|tv|please_sir|Please Sir!''

A teacher fresh out of training. He was allocated Class 5C, the most unruly form in the \nschool, at the beginning of term. At first relations were frosty between Bernard and Class 5C, but gradually Bernard gained the respect \nof his class and the rest of the staff. As the series progressed, he is shown to be a caring and very fair teacher and would always defend \nhis form, regardless of how much evidence is put towards them.\n\nIn the movie, he met air stewardess Penny Wheeler. After misinterpreting a 'few white lies' made by a pupil accidentally left behind, Penny   \nbegan to take shine to Bernard. After a period of dating, Bernard attempted to propose to Penny but she already said yes before he could complete his sentence and they got engaged and later married.\n\nShortly after Bernard got married, a new term started and was allocated Class 4C but it was not quite the same as 5C. He later resigned and left.\n\n'''Mr Norman Potter''' (Portrayed by [[Deryck Guyler]]). The pedantic and officious school caretaker. He claimed to have been a Desert Rat and constantly complains about the unruly behaviour of Hedge's class 5C. He is fiercely loyal (to the point of sycophancy) to the headmaster but a thorn in the side of the rest of the staff. His various comeuppances provide much of the ongoing humour of the sitcom.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of films based on British sitcoms]]\n* [[Welcome Back, Kotter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{British Comedy Guide|tv|please_sir|Please Sir!''
