The term has its origin in the [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|[[\u015bi\u1e63ya]]}}'', meaning \"disciple, learner\" or ''{{IAST|\u015bik\u1e63a}}'', meaning \"instruction\".\n\n==Historical importance to [[Sikh]] religion==\n*'''[[Bhai Mardana]]''' (1459-1534) was Guru Nanak Dev's companion on all of his Udasis (travels) and he played kirtan.\n*'''[[Bebe Nanaki]]''' (1464-1518) is known as the first Sikh. She was the elder sister of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder and first Guru (teacher) of Sikhism. Bebe Nanaki was the first to realize her brother's spiritual eminence.\n* '''[[Sri Chand]]''' ( \u0a38\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a40 \u0a1a\u0a70\u0a26 )(1494\u20131629)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/personalities/baba%20srichand/babasrichand.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> was the first son of [[Guru Nanak]], raised by his sister. Sri Chand was a renounciate [[yogi]]. After his father left Sri Chand stayed in [[Dera Baba Nanak]] and maintained Guru Nanak's temple. He established the [[Udasi]] order who travelled far and wide to spread the Word of Nanak.\n* '''[[Mata Khivi]]''' ( \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a16\u0a40\u0a35\u0a40 ) (1506\u20131582) is the only woman mentioned in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib. She was the wife of Guru Angad, and established the langar system, a free kitchen where all people were served as equals. Only the best possible ingredients were used, and everyone was treated with utmost courtesy. Her hospitality has been emulated over the centuries and has become the first cultural identity of the Sikhs. She helped her husband to establish the infant Sikh community on a stronger footing, and is described as good natured, efficient, and beautiful.\n* '''[[Baba Buddha]]''' (6 October 1506 \u2013 8 September 1631) was one of the earliest disciples of Guru Nanak. He lived an exemplary life and was called on to perform the ceremony passing the guruship on to five gurus, up to Guru Hargobind.  Baba Buddha trained the sixth Guru in martial arts as a young man to prepare him for the challenges of the guruship.\n* '''[[Bhai Gurdas]]''' ( \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a38 ) (1551\u20131637) is one of the most eminent literary personalities in the history of the [[Sikh]] [[religion]]. He was a scholar, poet and the [[scribe]] of the [[Adi Granth]]. He was an able [[missionary]] and an accomplished [[theologian]]. Being well versed in Indian religious thought, he was able to elaborate profoundly the tenets of [[Sikhism]].\n* '''[[Mata Gujri]]''' (1624\u20131705) joined the ninth Guru in his long meditation at [[Baba Bakala]] before he assumed the guruship.  She gave birth to and raised the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh.  Mata Gujri accompanied her youngest grandsons, Baba Fateh Singh and Baba Zorawar Singh to their martyrdom at [[Sirhind-Fategarh]], and subsequently passed as well.\n* '''[[Mai Bhago]]''' (\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a17\u0a4b)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|title=Great Sikh Warriors|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320221721/http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is one of the most famous women in Sikh history. She is always pictured on horseback wearing a turban with her headscarf gracefully flowing in the wind, courageously leading an army into battle. A staunch Sikh by birth and upbringing, she was distressed to hear in 1705 that some of the Sikhs of her village who had gone to Anandpur to fight for Guru Gobind Singh had deserted him under adverse conditions. She rallied the deserters, persuading them to meet the Guru and apologize to him. She led them back to Guru Gobind Singh Ji in the battlefield at Muktsar (Khidrana) Punjab. She thereafter stayed on with Guru Gobind Singh as one of his bodyguards, in male attire. After Guru Gobind Singh left his body at Nanded in 1708, she retired further south. She settled in Jinvara, where, immersed in meditation, she lived to an old age.\n* '''[[Bhai Mani Singh]]''' (1644-1738) was an 18th-century Sikh scholar and martyr. He was a childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh[1] and took the vows of Sikhism when the Guru inaugurated the Khalsa in March 1699. Soon after that, the Guru sent him to Amritsar to take charge of the Harmandar, which had been without a custodian since 1696. He took control and steered the course of Sikh destiny at a critical stage in Sikh history. The nature of his death in which he was dismembered joint by joint has become a part of the daily Sikh Ardas (prayer).\n* '''[[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]''' (1780 \u20131839) was the leader of the Sikh Empire which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. Ranjit Singh's reign introduced reforms, modernization, investment into infrastructure, and general prosperity. His government and army included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Ranjit Singh's legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurudwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. He was popularly known as Sher-i-Punjab, or \"Lion of Punjab\".\n* '''[[Bhagat Puran Singh]]'''( \u0a2d\u0a17\u0a24 \u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a28 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a18 )(1904\u20131992) was a great visionary, an accomplished environmentalist and a symbol of selfless service to humanity. He was the founder of the All India [[Pingalwara]] charitable society which imparts service to the poor, downtrodden, the dying, and the mentally and physically handicapped people.\n* '''[[Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]]''' (1929-2004) spread awareness of Sikhism in the West.  Through his influence, thousands of young people adopted the Sikh faith.  Harbhajan Singh's interfaith work included meetings with popes and archbishops in the 1970s and 80s, when Sikhism was little known outside of India.  A number of scholars have concurred that Harbhajan Singh Khalsa's introduction of Sikh teachings into the West helped identify Sikhism as a world religion while at the same time creating a compelling counter-narrative to that which identified Sikhs solely as race with a shared history in India.<ref>Verne A.

The term has its origin in the [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|[[\u015bi\u1e63ya]]}}'', meaning \"disciple, learner\" or ''{{IAST|\u015bik\u1e63a}}'', meaning \"instruction\".\n\n==Historical importance to [[Sikh]] religion==\n*'''[[Bhai Mardana]]''' (1459-1534) was Guru Nanak Dev's companion on all of his Udasis (travels) and he played kirtan.\n*'''[[Bebe Nanaki]]''' (1464-1518) is known as the first Sikh. She was the elder sister of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder and first Guru (teacher) of Sikhism. Bebe Nanaki was the first to realize her brother's spiritual eminence.\n* '''[[Sri Chand]]''' ( \u0a38\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a40 \u0a1a\u0a70\u0a26 )(1494\u20131629)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/personalities/baba%20srichand/babasrichand.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> was the first son of [[Guru Nanak]], raised by his sister. Sri Chand was a renounciate [[yogi]]. After his father left Sri Chand stayed in [[Dera Baba Nanak]] and maintained Guru Nanak's temple. He established the [[Udasi]] order who travelled far and wide to spread the Word of Nanak.\n* '''[[Mata Khivi]]''' ( \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a16\u0a40\u0a35\u0a40 ) (1506\u20131582) is the only woman mentioned in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib. She was the wife of Guru Angad, and established the langar system, a free kitchen where all people were served as equals. Only the best possible ingredients were used, and everyone was treated with utmost courtesy. Her hospitality has been emulated over the centuries and has become the first cultural identity of the Sikhs. She helped her husband to establish the infant Sikh community on a stronger footing, and is described as good natured, efficient, and beautiful.\n* '''[[Baba Buddha]]''' (6 October 1506 \u2013 8 September 1631) was one of the earliest disciples of Guru Nanak. He lived an exemplary life and was called on to perform the ceremony passing the guruship on to five gurus, up to Guru Hargobind.  Baba Buddha trained the sixth Guru in martial arts as a young man to prepare him for the challenges of the guruship.\n* '''[[Bhai Gurdas]]''' ( \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a38 ) (1551\u20131637) is one of the most eminent literary personalities in the history of the [[Sikh]] [[religion]]. He was a scholar, poet and the [[scribe]] of the [[Adi Granth]]. He was an able [[missionary]] and an accomplished [[theologian]]. Being well versed in Indian religious thought, he was able to elaborate profoundly the tenets of [[Sikhism]].\n* '''[[Mata Gujri]]''' (1624\u20131705) joined the ninth Guru in his long meditation at [[Baba Bakala]] before he assumed the guruship.  She gave birth to and raised the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh.  Mata Gujri accompanied her youngest grandsons, Baba Fateh Singh and Baba Zorawar Singh to their martyrdom at [[Sirhind-Fategarh]], and subsequently passed as well.\n* '''[[Mai Bhago]]''' (\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a17\u0a4b)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|title=Great Sikh Warriors|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320221721/http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is one of the most famous women in Sikh history. She is always pictured on horseback wearing a turban with her headscarf gracefully flowing in the wind, courageously leading an army into battle. A staunch Sikh by birth and upbringing, she was distressed to hear in 1705 that some of the Sikhs of her village who had gone to Anandpur to fight for Guru Gobind Singh had deserted him under adverse conditions. She rallied the deserters, persuading them to meet the Guru and apologize to him. She led them back to Guru Gobind Singh Ji in the battlefield at Muktsar (Khidrana) Punjab. She thereafter stayed on with Guru Gobind Singh as one of his bodyguards, in male attire. After Guru Gobind Singh left his body at Nanded in 1708, she retired further south. She settled in Jinvara, where, immersed in meditation, she lived to an old age.\n* '''[[Bhai Mani Singh]]''' (1644-1738) was an 18th-century Sikh scholar and martyr. He was a childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh[1] and took the vows of Sikhism when the Guru inaugurated the Khalsa in March 1699. Soon after that, the Guru sent him to Amritsar to take charge of the Harmandar, which had been without a custodian since 1696. He took control and steered the course of Sikh destiny at a critical stage in Sikh history. The nature of his death in which he was dismembered joint by joint has become a part of the daily Sikh Ardas (prayer).\n* '''[[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]''' (1780 \u20131839) was the leader of the Sikh Empire which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. Ranjit Singh's reign introduced reforms, modernization, investment into infrastructure, and general prosperity. His government and army included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Ranjit Singh's legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurudwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. He was popularly known as Sher-i-Punjab, or \"Lion of Punjab\".\n* '''[[Bhagat Puran Singh]]'''( \u0a2d\u0a17\u0a24 \u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a28 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a18 )(1904\u20131992) was a great visionary, an accomplished environmentalist and a symbol of selfless service to humanity. He was the founder of the All India [[Pingalwara]] charitable society which imparts service to the poor, downtrodden, the dying, and the mentally and physically handicapped people.\n* '''[[Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]]''' (1929-2004) spread awareness of Sikhism in the West.  Through his influence, thousands of young people adopted the Sikh faith.  Harbhajan Singh's interfaith work included meetings with popes and archbishops in the 1970s and 80s, when Sikhism was little known outside of India.  A number of scholars have concurred that Harbhajan Singh Khalsa's introduction of Sikh teachings into the West helped identify Sikhism as a world religion while at the same time creating a compelling counter-narrative to that which identified Sikhs solely as race with a shared history in India.<ref>Verne A.
