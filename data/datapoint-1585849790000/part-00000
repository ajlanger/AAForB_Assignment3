''Attendenti'' were eventually abolished in 1971.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\nThe term ''Orderly'' is in use for both the military and police assistants.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nThe term \"batman\" in the [[Pakistan Army]] dates from the period of the [[British Indian Army]]. In the modern Pakistan Army, civilian personnel are employed in this role and are designated as NCB (Non-Combatant Bearer). The term implies that the present-day batman is not a soldier or part of the fighting cadre of the army, and works only as a personal servant to each officer.\n\nThe employment of NCBs in the [[Pakistan Air Force]] and the [[Pakistan Navy]] is not officially recognized. However both these services pay their officers an extra allowance comparable to the average pay of a household servant.\n\n=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:17 2398 Book illustrations of Historical description of the clothes and weapons of Russian troops.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> Batman (military) (1802\u20131812)</center>]]\n\nThe [[Imperial Russian Army]] used the term ''denshchik'' ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a}}) for a batman. In the Russian Empire higher-ranking [[cavalry]] officers often chose [[Cossacks]] for these roles as they could be reasonably depended on to survive [[combat]], and were also known for resourcefulness on [[Military campaign|campaign]]. However, they were hired help, and had to be provided with a horse also. The lower-ranking officers from serf-owning families brought a servant from home they were familiar with, particularly the [[infantry]] and [[artillery]] officers that did not require additional protection in combat, and tended to leave the servants with the unit [[baggage train]]. After the abolition of [[serfdom]] in the Russian Empire (1861), many officers went on campaign without servants.\n\nAlthough the positions were abolished in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, the recognition that higher-ranking officers required assistance soon fostered an unofficial reintroduction of the role through secondment of an NCO to the officer's staff, usually also as the driver, which also at one stage became their unofficial role and title as many officers often \"lived\" out of their vehicles. The term was borrowed from the French, but adopted to Russian pronunciation as ''ordinarets'' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0446}}).\n\nSeveral ''ordirnartsy'' of the [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|marshals]] and generals commanding fronts and armies during the [[Second World War]] wrote memoirs about their service. For example, [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]'s \"driver\" was a semi-professional racing car driver Aleksandr Nikolaevich Buchin who met Zhukov by accident on the first day of the war when Zhukov's previous elderly driver failed to get the vehicle he was in out of the rut. Buchin drove Zhukov throughout the war and although he began the war as a private, he ended the war with the rank of captain. Buchin wrote his memoirs called ''One hundred and seventy thousand kilometres with Zhukov'', at the suggestion of the marshal in the 1970s.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe term \"emir eri\" was used for a soldier that attends an officer. The practice was abolished in 1950.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe official term used by the [[British Army]] in the First World War was \"soldier-servant\". Every officer was assigned a servant, usually chosen by the officer from among his men. The term ''batman'' replaced this in the inter-war years. By the Second World War, only senior officers of the army and [[Royal Air Force]] were officially assigned batmen, with junior officers usually sharing the services of one batman among several officers. Batwomen also served in the women's services.\n\nBatman was usually seen as a desirable position. The soldier was exempted from more onerous duties and often got better rations and other favours from his officer. Senior officers' batmen usually received fast promotion to [[lance-corporal]], with many becoming [[corporal]]s and even [[sergeant]]s. The position was generally phased out after the war. Officers of the [[Household Division]] however still have orderlies, because of the high proportion of ceremonial duties required of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Family History : Bretz-Halliday-George-Neilson|url=http://www.bretz.ca/GenWeb/html/george/narratives/4/|website=Our Family History|language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]] stewards performed many of the duties of batmen in the other services. Aboard ship, only [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captains]] and [[admiral]]s were assigned personal stewards, with the other officers being served by a pool of officers' stewards. Most vessels carried at least two stewards, with larger vessels carrying considerably more.\n\nThe term \"orderly\" was often used instead of \"batman\" in the [[British Empire|colonial forces]], especially in the [[British Indian Army]]. The orderly was frequently a civilian instead of a soldier. However, from 1903 to 1939 four Indian officers from different regiments were appointed each year to serve as \"King's (or Queen's) Indian Orderly Officers\" in attendance on the monarch in London. While performing some routine orderly functions the main role of these officers was to represent the Indian Army in [[full dress uniform]] at ceremonial functions in front of the British public who might otherwise seldom be made aware of its existence.<ref>Pages 161, 163 and 164, \"The Indian Army\", Boris Mollo, {{ISBN|0 7137 1074 8}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[British Armed Forces]], the term \"batman\" or \"batwoman\" was formerly also applied to a civilian who cleaned officers' messes or married quarters. In the Royal Air Force, free married quarters cleaning services were phased out for all officers except [[squadron leader]]s or above in command appointments as of 1 April 1972.\n\nOne famous example of officer and batman during the Second World War was British actor [[David Niven]] and fellow actor [[Peter Ustinov]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1260975.stm |title=Obituary: Sir Peter Ustinov |work=[[BBC News]] |date=29 March 2004 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref> Niven and Ustinov were working on the film ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', as actor and writer respectively, but the difference in their ranks\u2014Niven was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and Ustinov a private\u2014made their association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven's batman.\n\n=== United States ===\nAides are junior commissioned officers who are available to support some of the needs of general officers who serve in command positions in the rank of [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB885165119151872000 Thomas E.

Drivers may get additional training but not always in driving, taking their services or another services driver course and or other government agencies driving schools. Only personnel in the Enlisted Aide Program can serve as an Enlisted Aide.

The actor [[James Garner]] played such a role in the film ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964).\n\n== Fiction ==\n\nIn [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s novel ''[[Whose Body?]]'' (1923) and subsequent novels, [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]'s valet [[Mervyn Bunter]] was also his batman during [[World War I]]. Bunter is said to have helped rescue Lord Peter after he was buried alive when shell fire collapsed a dugout he was in and was credited with saving his life on several occasions both during and after the war. Bunter was also instrumental in helping his master recover from and cope with what was then called \"shell shock\" ([[post traumatic stress disorder]]) upon his return to civilian life. Bunter taught himself photography in order to assist His Lordship in his detective activities.\n\nIn the novella ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1933), Mr. Chipping's former student, Peter Colley, is killed during the Great War attempting to save the life of his batman and childhood antagonist-cum-friend, Perkins.\n\nIn [[DC Comics]] media, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] ([[Batman]]'s butler, created in 1943) has been referred to multiple times as \"Batman's batman.\" Currently unsubstantiated rumors have it that Alfred was also Thomas Wayne's (Bruce Wayne's late father) batman when both men were in military service.\n\nIn the ''[[Eagle (British comics)|Eagle]]'' comic strip ''[[Dan Dare]]'' (first published in 1950), Digby is Dan's batman.\n\n[[J. R. R.

[[Baldrick]], the bumbling and incompetent batman to Captain [[Edmund Blackadder]]. In the earlier series, taking place between the 1400s and the early 1800s, he plays Edmund Blackadder's [[dogsbody]] Baldrick, a similar, non-military role.\n\nIn the ''[[Honor Bound series|Honor Bound]]'' book series (1993\u20132012), the character of Sergeant Major Enrico Rodriguez served in this capacity to Cletus Frade's father.\n\nIn the animated television series ''[[ReBoot]]'' (1994\u20132001), 1 binome Binky Ffarquarson is batman to 0 binome fighter pilot Algernon Cholmondley-Worthington III (who is addressed in canon only as \"sir\").\n\nIn the television show ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' (created in 2009), the eponymous character's valet, Woodhouse, was the batman of his superior officer in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2010\u20132015), Lord Grantham's valet, Mr Bates, was his batman in the [[Boer War]]; it also appears that William Mason was assigned to be Matthew Crawley's batman in the First World War.\n\nIn the television series \n''[[Blunt Talk]]'' (2015\u20132016), Adrian Scarborough played Harry Chandler,[8] Falklands War veteran and former Royal Marines lance corporal turned Walter's valen.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Cold Days]]'' by [[Jim Butcher]], the lead character, Harry Dresden is assigned a batman, and initially both Harry and Cat Sith are very unhappy with this assignment.\n\nIn [[Terry Pratchett]]'s 2013 novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', the main character serves as batman to her lieutenant.\n\n[[Frank Herbert]]\u2019s 1984 novel ''[[Heretics of Dune?]]'', Patrin, the aide of Miles Teg, is referred to as the Bashar\u2019s Batman.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adjutant]]\n*[[Aide-de-camp]] (ADC)\n*[[Bagman]]\n*[[Squire]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|batman}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/july/batmen.htm |title=Recollections from memory about batmen |first=Muhammad |last=Akhtar Khan |work=Defence Journal |location=Karachi |date=July 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020818015349/http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/july/batmen.htm |archivedate=18 August 2002  }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Batman (Military)}}\n[[Category:Military life]]\n[[Category:Personal care and service occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Soldier or airman assigned to an officer as a personal servant}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\nA '''batman''' or an '''orderly''' is a [[soldier]] or [[airman]] assigned to a [[commissioned officer]] as a personal servant.

Officers of the [[Household Division]] however still have orderlies, because of the high proportion of ceremonial duties required of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Family History : Bretz-Halliday-George-Neilson|url=http://www.bretz.ca/GenWeb/html/george/narratives/4/|website=Our Family History|language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]] stewards performed many of the duties of batmen in the other services. Aboard ship, only [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captains]] and [[admiral]]s were assigned personal stewards, with the other officers being served by a pool of officers' stewards. Most vessels carried at least two stewards, with larger vessels carrying considerably more.\n\nThe term \"orderly\" was often used instead of \"batman\" in the [[British Empire|colonial forces]], especially in the [[British Indian Army]]. The orderly was frequently a civilian instead of a soldier. However, from 1903 to 1939 four Indian officers from different regiments were appointed each year to serve as \"King's (or Queen's) Indian Orderly Officers\" in attendance on the monarch in London. While performing some routine orderly functions the main role of these officers was to represent the Indian Army in [[full dress uniform]] at ceremonial functions in front of the British public who might otherwise seldom be made aware of its existence.<ref>Pages 161, 163 and 164, \"The Indian Army\", Boris Mollo, {{ISBN|0 7137 1074 8}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[British Armed Forces]], the term \"batman\" or \"batwoman\" was formerly also applied to a civilian who cleaned officers' messes or married quarters. In the Royal Air Force, free married quarters cleaning services were phased out for all officers except [[squadron leader]]s or above in command appointments as of 1 April 1972.\n\nOne famous example of officer and batman during the Second World War was British actor [[David Niven]] and fellow actor [[Peter Ustinov]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1260975.stm |title=Obituary: Sir Peter Ustinov |work=[[BBC News]] |date=29 March 2004 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref> Niven and Ustinov were working on the film ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', as actor and writer respectively, but the difference in their ranks\u2014Niven was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and Ustinov a private\u2014made their association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven's batman.\n\n=== United States ===\nAides are junior commissioned officers who are available to support some of the needs of general officers who serve in command positions in the rank of [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB885165119151872000 Thomas E.

This program is officially known as the Enlisted Aide Program. Generally the personnel are military cooks however in recent years, any enlisted person could volunteer to serve in this position. They attend a joint service course for Enlisted Aides and advanced culinary course for cooks.<ref>[https://quartermaster.army.mil/jccoe/Special_Programs_Directorate/Enlisted_Aide_web_documents/enlisted_aide_main.html Enlisted Aide Training Course]</ref> Many are often sent on to education outside the military to become chefs and butler training. Some will also be used as stewards and stewardess on very senior officer aircraft. In addition General and Flag officers are assigned a driver. Drivers may get additional training but not always in driving, taking their services or another services driver course and or other government agencies driving schools. Only personnel in the Enlisted Aide Program can serve as an Enlisted Aide. Drivers, admin personnel and others on the personal staff are often but not always selected locally.<ref>[https://quartermaster.army.mil/jccoe/Special_Programs_Directorate/Enlisted_Aide_web_documents/Senior%20Leader%20Aide%20Handbook%202009.pdf (2009) Officer/ Enlisted Aide Handbook]</ref>\n\nOrdinarily, enlisted service members would be prohibited from performing services as an aide. \"No officer may use an enlisted member as a servant for duties that contribute only to the officer's personal benefit and that have no reasonable connection with the officer's official responsibilities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/131509p.pdf |title=DOD Instruction 1315.09:  Utilization of Enlisted Personnel on Personal Staffs of General and Flag Officers |date=2 October 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref> according to the Department of Defense instruction 1315.09 for Enlisted Aides.\n\n====Trivia==== \n\nIn the [[United States Army]] the term \"dog robber\" (from the peacetime occupation of the title character of ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'', a fictional batman) was unofficially used, although that could also be applied to a junior officer who acted as a [[gofer]] to somebody with high rank. The actor [[James Garner]] played such a role in the film ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964).\n\n== Fiction ==\n\nIn [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s novel ''[[Whose Body?]]'' (1923) and subsequent novels, [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]'s valet [[Mervyn Bunter]] was also his batman during [[World War I]]. Bunter is said to have helped rescue Lord Peter after he was buried alive when shell fire collapsed a dugout he was in and was credited with saving his life on several occasions both during and after the war. Bunter was also instrumental in helping his master recover from and cope with what was then called \"shell shock\" ([[post traumatic stress disorder]]) upon his return to civilian life. Bunter taught himself photography in order to assist His Lordship in his detective activities.\n\nIn the novella ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1933), Mr. Chipping's former student, Peter Colley, is killed during the Great War attempting to save the life of his batman and childhood antagonist-cum-friend, Perkins.\n\nIn [[DC Comics]] media, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] ([[Batman]]'s butler, created in 1943) has been referred to multiple times as \"Batman's batman.\" Currently unsubstantiated rumors have it that Alfred was also Thomas Wayne's (Bruce Wayne's late father) batman when both men were in military service.\n\nIn the ''[[Eagle (British comics)|Eagle]]'' comic strip ''[[Dan Dare]]'' (first published in 1950), Digby is Dan's batman.\n\n[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] took the relationship of his characters [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] (introduced in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' in 1954) from his observations while in military service during [[World War I]] of the relationship between a batman and his officer.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Humphrey |editor-last=Carpenter |editorlink=Humphrey Carpenter |title=[[The Letters of J.R.R.

Despite a title that baffled most Americans (who no doubt were thinking of the other [[Batman]]), the tune hit number 20 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQQ5sEOhbjQ |title=Whistling Jack Smith \u2013 I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman |work=YouTube |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the musical film ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968), [[Caractacus Potts]]'s father was Lord Scrumptious's batman.\n\nIn the [[BBC]] sitcom ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), set during [[World War I]], actor [[Tony Robinson]] portrays Private S. [[Baldrick]], the bumbling and incompetent batman to Captain [[Edmund Blackadder]]. In the earlier series, taking place between the 1400s and the early 1800s, he plays Edmund Blackadder's [[dogsbody]] Baldrick, a similar, non-military role.\n\nIn the ''[[Honor Bound series|Honor Bound]]'' book series (1993\u20132012), the character of Sergeant Major Enrico Rodriguez served in this capacity to Cletus Frade's father.\n\nIn the animated television series ''[[ReBoot]]'' (1994\u20132001), 1 binome Binky Ffarquarson is batman to 0 binome fighter pilot Algernon Cholmondley-Worthington III (who is addressed in canon only as \"sir\").\n\nIn the television show ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' (created in 2009), the eponymous character's valet, Woodhouse, was the batman of his superior officer in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2010\u20132015), Lord Grantham's valet, Mr Bates, was his batman in the [[Boer War]]; it also appears that William Mason was assigned to be Matthew Crawley's batman in the First World War.\n\nIn the television series \n''[[Blunt Talk]]'' (2015\u20132016), Adrian Scarborough played Harry Chandler,[8] Falklands War veteran and former Royal Marines lance corporal turned Walter's valen.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Cold Days]]'' by [[Jim Butcher]], the lead character, Harry Dresden is assigned a batman, and initially both Harry and Cat Sith are very unhappy with this assignment.\n\nIn [[Terry Pratchett]]'s 2013 novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', the main character serves as batman to her lieutenant.\n\n[[Frank Herbert]]\u2019s 1984 novel ''[[Heretics of Dune (novel)|Heretics of Dune]]'', Patrin, the aide of Miles Teg, is referred to as the Bashar\u2019s Batman.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adjutant]]\n*[[Aide-de-camp]] (ADC)\n*[[Bagman]]\n*[[Squire]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|batman}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/july/batmen.htm |title=Recollections from memory about batmen |first=Muhammad |last=Akhtar Khan |work=Defence Journal |location=Karachi |date=July 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020818015349/http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/july/batmen.htm |archivedate=18 August 2002  }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Batman (Military)}}\n[[Category:Military life]]\n[[Category:Personal care and service occupations]]\n", "name_user": "66.227.192.133", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFiction:Again attempt link fix)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(military)"}
