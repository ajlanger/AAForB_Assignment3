A pioneer of the [[Modern animation in the United States|American animation industry]], he introduced several developments in the production of [[cartoon]]s. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most [[Academy Awards]] earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] Special Achievement Awards and an [[Emmy Award]], among other honors. Several of his films are included in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Brothers Studio]] with his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]. With [[Ub Iwerks]], Walt developed the character [[Mickey Mouse]] in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip [[Technicolor]], [[feature-length]] cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and [[live-action]] films followed after World War II, including the critically successful ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950) and ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.\n\nIn the 1950s, Disney expanded into the [[amusement park]] industry, and in 1955 he opened [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Disneyland]]'' and ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''; he was also involved in planning the [[American National Exhibition|1959 Moscow Fair]], the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], and the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]], the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]\" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.\n\nDisney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was [[Racism|racist]] or [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of [[American imperialism]]. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national [[cultural icon]]. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his namesake studio and company maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life: 1901\u20131920===\nWalt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's [[Hermosa, Chicago|Hermosa]] neighborhood.{{efn|In 1909, in a renumbering exercise, the property's address changed to 2156 North Tripp Avenue.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=8}}}} He was the fourth son of [[Elias Disney]]{{nsmdns}}born in the [[Province of Canada]], to Irish parents{{nsmdns}}and [[Flora Call Disney|Flora]] ({{nee}} Call), an American of German and English descent.<ref name=\"ST: background\" /><ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" />{{efn|Disney was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny, a Frenchman who had traveled to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.{{sfnm|1a1=Mosley|1y=1990|1p=22|2a1=Eliot|2y=1995|2p=2}} The family [[anglicisation|anglicized]] the d'Isigny name to \"Disney\" and settled in the English village now known as [[Norton Disney]] in the [[East Midlands]].<ref name=Ancestors />}} Aside from Disney, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, Raymond and [[Roy O.

In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=9\u201310, 15}} Elias was a subscriber to the ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'' newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of [[Ryan Walker (cartoonist)|Ryan Walker]].{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=13}} Disney also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons.<ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" /> He lived near the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] line and became enamored with trains.{{sfn|Broggie|2006|pp=33\u201335}} He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=16}}\n\nIn 1911, the Disneys moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=10}} There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School, where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of [[vaudeville]] and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=13}} Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[Kansas City Times]]''. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the ''Times'' before school and repeated the round for the evening ''Star'' after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=18\u201319}} He attended Saturday courses at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] and also took a [[correspondence course]] in cartooning.<ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" /><ref name=\"KCL: WD\" />\n\nIn 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the city with his family.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=30}} Disney enrolled at [[McKinley High School (Chicago)|McKinley High School]] and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I;<ref name=\"D23: WD\" />{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=12}} he also took night courses at the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]].{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=39}} In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the [[United States Army]] to fight [[Western Front (World War I)|against the Germans]], but he was rejected for being too young. After [[age fabrication|forging the date of birth]] on his birth certificate, he joined the [[Red Cross]] in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the armistice]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=36\u201338}} He drew cartoons on the side of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.<ref name=\"NYT: Obit\" /> Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=41}} where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist [[Ub Iwerks]].{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n===Early career: 1920\u20131928===\n[[File:Walt Disney envelope ca. 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Walt Disney's business envelope featured a self-portrait {{circa|1921}}]]\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off.

Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=25}} The company produced commercials using the [[cutout animation]] technique.{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=63}} Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' and ''[[Koko the Clown]]''. With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=57\u201358}}{{efn|The book, Edwin G. Lutz's ''Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development'' (1920), was the only one in the local library on the subject; the camera he borrowed from Cauger.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=57\u201358}}}} He came to the conclusion that [[cel animation]] was more promising than the cutout method.{{efn|Cutout animation is the technique of producing cartoons by animating objects cut from paper, material or photographs and photographing them moving incrementally. Cel animation is the method of drawing or painting onto transparent celluloid sheets (\"cels\"), with each sheet an incremental movement on from the previous.{{sfn|Withrow|2009|p=48}}}} Unable to persuade Cauger to try [[cel]] animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, [[Fred Harman]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=56}} Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as \"Newman's Laugh-O-Grams\".{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=14}} Disney studied [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry's]] ''[[Aesop's Fables (film series)|Aesop's Fables]]'' as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized fairy tales.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=60}}\n\n[[File:Newman Laugh-O-Gram (1921).webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|''Newman Laugh-O-Gram'' (1921)]]\nIn May 1921, the success of the \"Laugh-O-Grams\" led to the establishment of [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio]], for which he hired more animators, including Fred Harman's brother [[Harman and Ising|Hugh]], [[Harman and Ising|Rudolf Ising]] and Iwerks.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=60\u201361, 64\u201366}} The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the company solvent, so Disney started production of ''[[Alice's Wonderland]]''{{nsmdns}}based on ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''{{nsmdns}}which combined live action with animation; he cast [[Virginia Davis]] in [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the title role]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=15}} The result, a 12-and-a-half-minute, [[short film|one-reel]] film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.{{sfnm|1a1=Gabler|1y=2006|1pp=71\u201373|2a1=Nichols|2y=2014|2p=102}}\n\nDisney moved to Hollywood in July 1923. Although New York was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from [[tuberculosis]] there,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=39}} and he hoped to become a live-action film director.{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1995|p=29}} Disney's efforts to sell ''Alice's Wonderland'' were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor [[Margaret J. Winkler]]. She was losing the rights to both the ''[[Out of the Inkwell]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'' cartoons, and needed a new series. In October, they signed a contract for six [[Alice Comedies|''Alice'' comedies]], with an option for two further series of six episodes each.{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1995|p=29}}{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=40}} Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studio{{nsmdns}}which later became [[The Walt Disney Company]]{{nsmdns}}to produce the films;{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=78}}<ref name=\"WDC: About\" /> they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month.

Sherwood]] described him as \"almost painfully shy&nbsp;... diffident\" and self-deprecating.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=204}} According to his biographer [[Richard Schickel]], Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity.{{sfn|Schickel|1986|p=341}} Kimball argues that Disney \"played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public\" and knew that he was doing so.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=205}} Disney acknowledged the fa\u00e7ade and told a friend that \"I'm not Walt Disney. I do a lot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink.\"<ref name=\"PBS trailer 1\" /> Critic [[Otis Ferguson]], in ''[[The New Republic]]'', called the private Disney: \"common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=205}} Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said \"That'll work\", it was an indication of high praise.{{sfn|Norman|2013|p=64}} Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=77}}\n\nViews of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions.{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=84}} Mark Langer, in the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', writes that \"Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture.\"{{sfn|Langer|2000}} Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney \"as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas\",{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=84}} while [[PBS]] records that critics have censured his work because of its \"smooth fa\u00e7ade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history\".<ref name=\"PBS: AmEx\" /> Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time,{{sfn|Langer|2000}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} there were criticisms by reviewers. [[C. A. Lejeune|Caroline Lejeune]] comments in ''[[The Observer]]'' that ''Snow White'' (1937) \"has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn.\"<ref name=\"Obs: Snow White\" /> Robin Allen, writing for ''The Times'', notes that ''Fantasia'' (1940) was \"condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into [[bathos]]\",<ref name=\"Times: Fantasia\" /> while Lejeune, reviewing ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1951), feels the film \"may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy\".<ref name=\"Obs: Alice\" /> ''Peter Pan'' (1953) was criticized in ''The Times'' as \"a children's classic vulgarized\" with \"Tinker Bell&nbsp;... a peroxided American cutie\". The reviewer opined that Disney \"has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place\".<ref name=\"Times: PP\" />\n\nDisney has been accused of [[antisemitism|anti-Semitism]],<ref name=\"NYT: Dargis\" />{{efn|For example, the animator [[Art Babbitt]], an organizer of the 1941 strike at Disney's studio, claimed that he saw Disney and his lawyer attend meetings of the [[German American Bund]], a pro-Nazi organization, during the late 1930s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=448}} Gabler questions Babbitt's claim on the basis that Disney had no time for political meetings and was \"something of a political na\u00eff\" during the 1930s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=448, 457}}}} although none of his employees\u2014including the animator [[Art Babbitt]], who disliked Disney intensely\u2014ever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=448, 457}} The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons.{{efn|Examples include ''The Three Little Pigs'' (in which the Big Bad Wolf comes to the door dressed as a Jewish peddler) and ''[[The Opry House]]'' (in which Mickey Mouse is dressed and dances as a [[Hasidic Jew]]).{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=456}}<ref name=\"Creative Explosion\" />}} Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named \"1955 Man of the Year\" by the [[B'nai B'rith]] chapter in Beverly Hills,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=456}}<ref name=\"Creative Explosion\" /> and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=455}}{{efn|As pointed out by story artist [[Joe Grant]], which included himself, production manager Harry Tytle, and head of merchandising [[Kay Kamen]], who once quipped that Disney's New York office had \"more Jews than The Book of Leviticus\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=455}}}} Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-Semitism and that Disney was \"not [anti-Semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite\". Gabler concludes that \"though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning some members of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|MPAPAI]]], and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life\".<ref name=\"CBS: Gabler\" /> Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=611}}\n\nDisney has also been accused of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}{{efn|Examples include ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'', in which Mickey Mouse dresses in [[blackface]]; the black-colored bird in the short ''Who Killed Cock Robin''; the American Indians in ''Peter Pan''; and the crows in ''Dumbo'' (although the case has been made that the crows were sympathetic to Dumbo because they knew what it was like to be ostracized).{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}}} The feature film ''[[Song of the South]]'' was criticized by contemporary film critics, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], and others for its perpetuation of [[Stereotypes of African Americans|black stereotypes]],{{sfn|Cohen|2004|p=60}} but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, [[James Baskett]], the first black actor so honored.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=438\u201339}}{{efn|Baskett died shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for his support.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=438\u201339}}}} Gabler argues that \"Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}} [[Floyd Norman]], the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, \"Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of people{{nsmdns}}and by this I mean all people{{nsmdns}}can only be called exemplary.\"{{sfn|Korkis|2012|p=xi}}\n\nWatts argues that many of Disney's post-World War II films \"legislated a kind of cultural [[Marshall Plan]]. They nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States.\"{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=107}} Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney's studio as an \"agent of manipulation and repression\", although he observes that it has \"labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy\".{{sfn|Telotte|2008|p=19}} John Tomlinson, in his study ''Cultural Imperialism'', examines the work of [[Ariel Dorfman]] and [[Armand Mattelart]], whose 1971 book {{lang|es|Para leer al Pato Donald}} (trans: ''[[How to Read Donald Duck]]'') identifies that there are \"imperialist&nbsp;... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome fa\u00e7ade of the world of Walt Disney\"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as \"it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children.\"{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=41}} Tomlinson views their argument as flawed, as \"they simply ''assume'' that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent&nbsp;... ['[[Yankee]]'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=44}}\n\nSeveral commentators have described Disney as a [[cultural icon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mannheim|1y=2016|1p=40|2a1=Krasniewicz|2y=2010|2p=xxii|3a1=Watts|3y=2013|3p=58| 4a1=Painter| 4y=2008|4p=25}} On Disney's death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those \"considered valuable in American Christian society\", which include \"individualism, decency,&nbsp;... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration\".<ref name=\"Izard: Master\" /> Disney's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' calls the films \"wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining&nbsp;... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty\".<ref name=\"Times: Obit\" /> Journalist [[Bosley Crowther]] argues that Disney's \"achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history.\"<ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" /> Correspondent [[Alistair Cooke]] calls Disney a \"folk-hero&nbsp;... the Pied Piper of Hollywood\",<ref name=\"Guard: Cooke\" /> while Gabler considers Disney \"reshaped the culture and the American consciousness\".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} In the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', Langer writes:\n\n<blockquote>Disney remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.{{sfn|Langer|2000}}</blockquote>\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notes|30em}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AFI: 100\">\n{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Movies of All Time |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/movies.aspx |website=American Film Institute |accessdate=May 13, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424004920/http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WDC: About\">\n{{cite web|title=About the Walt Disney Company|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/|website=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=May 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505063818/https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/|archivedate=May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Times: PP\">\n{{cite news|title=Disney's ''Peter Pan''|work=The Times|date=April 15, 1953|page=9}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Obs: Alice\">\n{{cite news|last1=Lejeune|first1=C.

A pioneer of the [[Modern animation in the United States|American animation industry]], he introduced several developments in the production of [[cartoon]]s. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most [[Academy Awards]] earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] Special Achievement Awards and an [[Emmy Award]], among other honors. Several of his films are included in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Brothers Studio]] with his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]. With [[Ub Iwerks]], Walt developed the character [[Mickey Mouse]] in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip [[Technicolor]], [[feature-length]] cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and [[live-action]] films followed after World War II, including the critically successful ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950) and ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.\n\nIn the 1950s, Disney expanded into the [[amusement park]] industry, and in 1955 he opened [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Disneyland]]'' and ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''; he was also involved in planning the [[American National Exhibition|1959 Moscow Fair]], the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], and the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]], the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]\" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.\n\nDisney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was [[Racism|racist]] or [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of [[American imperialism]]. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national [[cultural icon]]. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his namesake studio and company maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life: 1901\u20131920===\nWalt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's [[Hermosa, Chicago|Hermosa]] neighborhood.{{efn|In 1909, in a renumbering exercise, the property's address changed to 2156 North Tripp Avenue.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=8}}}} He was the fourth son of [[Elias Disney]]{{nsmdns}}born in the [[Province of Canada]], to Irish parents{{nsmdns}}and [[Flora Call Disney|Flora]] ({{nee}} Call), an American of German and English descent.<ref name=\"ST: background\" /><ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" />{{efn|Disney was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny, a Frenchman who had traveled to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.{{sfnm|1a1=Mosley|1y=1990|1p=22|2a1=Eliot|2y=1995|2p=2}} The family [[anglicisation|anglicized]] the d'Isigny name to \"Disney\" and settled in the English village now known as [[Norton Disney]] in the [[East Midlands]].<ref name=Ancestors />}} Aside from Disney, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, Raymond and [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]; the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=9\u201310}} In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in [[Marceline, Missouri]], where his uncle Robert had just purchased land. In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=9\u201310, 15}} Elias was a subscriber to the ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'' newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of [[Ryan Walker (cartoonist)|Ryan Walker]].{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=13}} Disney also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons.<ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" /> He lived near the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] line and became enamored with trains.{{sfn|Broggie|2006|pp=33\u201335}} He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=16}}\n\nIn 1911, the Disneys moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=10}} There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School, where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of [[vaudeville]] and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=13}} Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[Kansas City Times]]''. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the ''Times'' before school and repeated the round for the evening ''Star'' after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=18\u201319}} He attended Saturday courses at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] and also took a [[correspondence course]] in cartooning.<ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" /><ref name=\"KCL: WD\" />\n\nIn 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the city with his family.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=30}} Disney enrolled at [[McKinley High School (Chicago)|McKinley High School]] and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I;<ref name=\"D23: WD\" />{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=12}} he also took night courses at the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]].{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=39}} In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the [[United States Army]] to fight [[Western Front (World War I)|against the Germans]], but he was rejected for being too young. After [[age fabrication|forging the date of birth]] on his birth certificate, he joined the [[Red Cross]] in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the armistice]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=36\u201338}} He drew cartoons on the side of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.<ref name=\"NYT: Obit\" /> Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=41}} where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist [[Ub Iwerks]].{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n===Early career: 1920\u20131928===\n[[File:Walt Disney envelope ca. 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Walt Disney's business envelope featured a self-portrait {{circa|1921}}]]\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1p=56|2a1=Barrier|2y=2007|2pp=24\u201325}} Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.&nbsp;V. Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=25}} The company produced commercials using the [[cutout animation]] technique.{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=63}} Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' and ''[[Koko the Clown]]''. With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=57\u201358}}{{efn|The book, Edwin G.

Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}} [[Floyd Norman]], the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, \"Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of people{{nsmdns}}and by this I mean all people{{nsmdns}}can only be called exemplary.\"{{sfn|Korkis|2012|p=xi}}\n\nWatts argues that many of Disney's post-World War II films \"legislated a kind of cultural [[Marshall Plan]]. They nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States.\"{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=107}} Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney's studio as an \"agent of manipulation and repression\", although he observes that it has \"labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy\".{{sfn|Telotte|2008|p=19}} John Tomlinson, in his study ''Cultural Imperialism'', examines the work of [[Ariel Dorfman]] and [[Armand Mattelart]], whose 1971 book {{lang|es|Para leer al Pato Donald}} (trans: ''[[How to Read Donald Duck]]'') identifies that there are \"imperialist&nbsp;... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome fa\u00e7ade of the world of Walt Disney\"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as \"it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children.\"{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=41}} Tomlinson views their argument as flawed, as \"they simply ''assume'' that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent&nbsp;... ['[[Yankee]]'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=44}}\n\nSeveral commentators have described Disney as a [[cultural icon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mannheim|1y=2016|1p=40|2a1=Krasniewicz|2y=2010|2p=xxii|3a1=Watts|3y=2013|3p=58| 4a1=Painter| 4y=2008|4p=25}} On Disney's death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those \"considered valuable in American Christian society\", which include \"individualism, decency,&nbsp;... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration\".<ref name=\"Izard: Master\" /> Disney's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' calls the films \"wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining&nbsp;... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty\".<ref name=\"Times: Obit\" /> Journalist [[Bosley Crowther]] argues that Disney's \"achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history.\"<ref name=\"EB: Crowther\" /> Correspondent [[Alistair Cooke]] calls Disney a \"folk-hero&nbsp;... the Pied Piper of Hollywood\",<ref name=\"Guard: Cooke\" /> while Gabler considers Disney \"reshaped the culture and the American consciousness\".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} In the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', Langer writes:\n\n<blockquote>Disney remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.{{sfn|Langer|2000}}</blockquote>\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notes|30em}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AFI: 100\">\n{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Movies of All Time |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/movies.aspx |website=American Film Institute |accessdate=May 13, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424004920/http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WDC: About\">\n{{cite web|title=About the Walt Disney Company|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/|website=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=May 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505063818/https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/|archivedate=May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Times: PP\">\n{{cite news|title=Disney's ''Peter Pan''|work=The Times|date=April 15, 1953|page=9}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Obs: Alice\">\n{{cite news|last1=Lejeune|first1=C.
