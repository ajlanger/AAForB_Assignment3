He was the [[List of prime ministers of Italy|49th Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1993 to 1994 and was the tenth [[President of Italy]] from 1999 to 2006.\n\n==Biography==\n===Education===\nCiampi was born in [[Livorno]] ([[Province of Livorno]]).<ref name=Sen>[http://www.senato.it/leg/15/BGT/Schede/Attsen/00000594.htm Page at Senate website] {{in lang|it}}.</ref>\n\nHe received a B.A. in [[ancient Greek literature]] and [[classical philology]] in 1941 from the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], one of the country's most prestigious universities, defending a thesis entitled ''[[Favorinus|Favorino]] d'[[Arles|Arelate]] e la consolazione \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2''<ref>''Favorinus of Arles and the Consolation \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2'', anastatic reprint by the Scuola Normale di Pisa editions, editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Franco Montanari|it|3=Franco Montanari|vertical-align=sup}}, introduction of [[Salvatore Settis]], {{ISBN|978-88-7642-411-3}}.</ref> under the direction of the Hellenist [[Augusto Mancini]]. Then he was called to military duty in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]] as a lieutenant. On 8 September 1943, on the date of the [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]], he refused to remain in the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italian Social Republic]], and took refuge in [[Abruzzo]], in [[Scanno, Italy|Scanno]]. He subsequently managed to pass the lines and reach [[Bari]], where he joined the [[Partito d'Azione]] (and thus the [[Italian resistance movement]]).\n\nIn 1946 he married Franca Pilla. That same year, he obtained a B.A. in law from the [[University of Pisa]] and began working at the [[Bank of Italy|Banca d'Italia]]. He also joined the [[CGIL]] (Trade Union), which he left in 1980.\n\n===Bank of Italy===\nIn 1960, he was called to work in the central administration of the [[Bank of Italy|Bank of Italy]], where he became Secretary General in 1973, Vice Director General in 1976, and Director General in 1978. In October 1979, he was nominated Governor of the Bank of Italy and President of the national Bureau de Change, positions he filled until 1993.\n\n===Political career===\nCiampi was the first non-parliamentarian prime minister of Italy in more than 100 years.<ref name=went28apr>{{cite news|last=Wentworth|first=Richard L.|title=Italy Turns to a Banker to Form Government|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0428/28071.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=28 April 1993}}</ref> From April 1993 to May 1994 he oversaw a [[technical government]]. Later, as treasury minister from 1996 to May 1999 in the governments of [[Romano Prodi]] and [[Massimo D'Alema]], he was credited with adopting the euro currency. He personally chose the Italian design for the 1-euro coin, whereas all others were left to a television vote among some candidates the ministry had prepared (see also: [[Italian euro coins]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nCiampi chose the [[Vitruvian man]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the symbolic grounds that it represented man as a measure of all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] material of the coin.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Presidency and afterward==\n[[File:20050407-2 wf1g6022jas-1-515h.jpg|thumb|right|Ciampi meets U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] at the Quirinale Palace, 7 April 2005]]\nCiampi was elected with a broad majority, and was the second president ever to be elected at the first ballot (when there is a requirement of a two-thirds majority) in a joint session of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[Italian Senate]] and representatives of the Regions.\n\nHe usually refrained from intervening directly into the political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently stressed the need for all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President \u2013 the so-called ''Ciampi-bis'' \u2013 was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before [[2006 Italian presidential election|his mandate expired]]. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, [[Giorgio Napolitano]].\n\nAs President, Ciampi was not considered to be close to the positions of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternance after the devout [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. He often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling in Italy because of its abuse by the fascist regime.\n\nHe died in Rome on 16 September 2016 at the age of 95.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-former-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-aged-95-1474023277 Italy's former President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies aged 95] Wall Street

He was the [[List of prime ministers of Italy|49th Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1993 to 1994 and was the tenth [[President of Italy]] from 1999 to 2006.\n\n==Biography==\n===Education===\nCiampi was born in [[Livorno]] ([[Province of Livorno]]).<ref name=Sen>[http://www.senato.it/leg/15/BGT/Schede/Attsen/00000594.htm Page at Senate website] {{in lang|it}}.</ref>\n\nHe received a B.A. in [[ancient Greek literature]] and [[classical philology]] in 1941 from the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], one of the country's most prestigious universities, defending a thesis entitled ''[[Favorinus|Favorino]] d'[[Arles|Arelate]] e la consolazione \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2''<ref>''Favorinus of Arles and the Consolation \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2'', anastatic reprint by the Scuola Normale di Pisa editions, editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Franco Montanari|it|3=Franco Montanari|vertical-align=sup}}, introduction of [[Salvatore Settis]], {{ISBN|978-88-7642-411-3}}.</ref> under the direction of the Hellenist [[Augusto Mancini]]. Then he was called to military duty in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]] as a lieutenant. On 8 September 1943, on the date of the [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]], he refused to remain in the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italian Social Republic]], and took refuge in [[Abruzzo]], in [[Scanno, Italy|Scanno]]. He subsequently managed to pass the lines and reach [[Bari]], where he joined the [[Partito d'Azione]] (and thus the [[Italian resistance movement]]).\n\nIn 1946 he married Franca Pilla. That same year, he obtained a B.A. in law from the [[University of Pisa]] and began working at the [[Bank of Italy|Banca d'Italia]]. He also joined the [[CGIL]] (Trade Union), which he left in 1980.\n\n===Bank of Italy===\nIn 1960, he was called to work in the central administration of the [[Bank of Italy|Bank of Italy]], where he became Secretary General in 1973, Vice Director General in 1976, and Director General in 1978. In October 1979, he was nominated Governor of the Bank of Italy and President of the national Bureau de Change, positions he filled until 1993.\n\n===Political career===\nCiampi was the first non-parliamentarian prime minister of Italy in more than 100 years.<ref name=went28apr>{{cite news|last=Wentworth|first=Richard L.|title=Italy Turns to a Banker to Form Government|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0428/28071.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=28 April 1993}}</ref> From April 1993 to May 1994 he oversaw a [[technical government]]. Later, as treasury minister from 1996 to May 1999 in the governments of [[Romano Prodi]] and [[Massimo D'Alema]], he was credited with adopting the euro currency. He personally chose the Italian design for the 1-euro coin, whereas all others were left to a television vote among some candidates the ministry had prepared (see also: [[Italian euro coins]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nCiampi chose the [[Vitruvian man]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the symbolic grounds that it represented man as a measure of all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] material of the coin.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Presidency and afterward==\n[[File:20050407-2 wf1g6022jas-1-515h.jpg|thumb|right|Ciampi meets U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] at the Quirinale Palace, April 7, 2005]]\nCiampi was elected with a broad majority, and was the second president ever to be elected at the first ballot (when there is a requirement of a two-thirds majority) in a joint session of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[Italian Senate]] and representatives of the Regions.\n\nHe usually refrained from intervening directly into the political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently stressed the need for all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President \u2013 the so-called ''Ciampi-bis'' \u2013 was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before [[2006 Italian presidential election|his mandate expired]]. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, [[Giorgio Napolitano]].\n\nAs President, Ciampi was not considered to be close to the positions of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternance after the devout [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. He often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling in Italy because of its abuse by the fascist regime.\n\nHe died in Rome on 16 September 2016 at the age of 95.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-former-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-aged-95-1474023277 Italy's former President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies aged 95] Wall Street Journal</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/former-italian-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-at-95 Former Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies at 95] The Guardian</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/world/europe/carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dead.html|title=Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Former Italian Prime Minister, Dies at 95|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 September 2016|access-date=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nAs President of the Italian Republic between 18 May 1999 and 15 May 2006, Ciampi held the roles of:\n*Head of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]\n*Chief of the [[Military Order of Italy]]\n*Head of the [[Order of Merit for Labour]]\n*Head of the [[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity]]\n*Head of the [[Order of Vittorio Veneto]]\n*Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]\n*Collar of the [[Order of Pius IX]] (Papal Order)\n*1982: Great Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]\n*1985: Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] (France)\n*1986: Great Cross of [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n*1991: Honorary degree, [[University of Pavia]]\n*1993: Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (Japan)\n*1995: Freeman of the City of [[Naples]]\n*1999: Collar of the [[Order of the White Rose]] (Finland)\n*2000: [[Gold Medal of the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe]]\n*2000: Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (United Kingdom, 16 October 2000)\n*2000: {{flagicon|Poland}} Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (Poland)\n*2001: Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]]\n*2001: Grand Cross of the [[Grand Order of King Tomislav]] (\"For outstanding contribution to the promotion of friendship and development co-operation between the Republic of Croatia and the Italian Republic.\" \u2013 Croatia, 19 October 2001)\n*2001: Honorary doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]] Faculty of Economics\n*2002: Grand Star of Honour for [[Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria|Services to the Republic of Austria]]\n*2002: {{flagicon|Slovakia}} -
