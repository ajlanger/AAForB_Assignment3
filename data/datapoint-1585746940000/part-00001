Its [[Rock Hill Downtown Historic District|historic downtown]] consist of twelve contiguous buildings built as early as 1840 offering dining and retail options. The city is also home to three colleges, including [[Winthrop University]], a public liberal arts university founded in 1886 which enrolls nearly 6,000 students annually.\n\n==History==\n[[File:U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (Rock Hill, South Carolina) 1933.jpg|thumb|right|Historic post office in Rock Hill]]\n\n===Pre-colonization===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nProceeding cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] lived in the Piedmont for thousands of years.  The historic [[Catawba Indian Nation]], a traditionally [[Siouan]]-speaking tribe, was here at the time of European encounter.  Currently the only tribe in South Carolina that is federally recognized, its members live near Rock Hill.\n\n===Early colonization===\n\nAlthough some European settlers had already arrived in the Rock Hill area in the 1830s and 1840s, Rock Hill did not become an actual town until the [[Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad]] Company made the decision to send a rail line through the area. Originally, the railroad had hoped to build a station in the nearby village of [[Ebenezer, South Carolina|Ebenezerville]] which was squarely between [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. When approached, however, the locals in Ebenezerville refused to have the railroad run through their village since they considered it dirty and noisy. Instead, engineers and surveyors decided to run the line two miles away by a local landmark. According to some, the engineers marked the spot on the map and named it \"rocky hill.\"<ref name=Willoughby>{{cite book|last=Willoughby|first=Lynn|title=The \"Good Town\" Does Well: Rock Hill, S.C., 1852\u20132002|year=2002|publisher=Written in Stone|location=Orangeburg, South Carolina|isbn=0-9669707-2-1}}</ref>{{RP|page=26}}\n\nSome of Rock Hill's early founding families\u2014the White family, the Black family, and the Moores\u2014believed that having a rail depot so close to them would be advantageous, so they decided to give the Columbia and Charlotte Railroad the right of way through their properties. As the three largest landowners in the area, this settled the matter. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|George Pendleton White]] contracted with the railroad to build a section of the line. Construction began in 1848. The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. A few weeks later, on April 17, 1852, the first Rock Hill Post Office opened.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=26\u201328}}\n\nNow that Rock Hill had a name, a railroad station, and a post office, it began to draw more settlers to the area. Captain J. H. McGinnis built a small general store near the station in 1849 or 1850 to provide supplies for the construction and railroad workers.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=27\u201328}} Templeton Black, who had leased the land to McGinnis, decided to devote some of his other adjacent land to building a larger town. He hired a local surveyor, Squire John Roddey, to organize a main street. Black sold his first plot of land along that street to Ira Ferguson for $125 a few weeks before the post office opened; other businessmen bought plots quickly after that.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\nRock Hill Academy, the first school in Rock Hill, opened in September 1854. Despite its official name, most residents referred to it as the Pine Grove Academy after the pine grove it was located in. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|Ann Hutchinson White]], wife of George White, donated the land to the school after her husband's death. The school had 60 male pupils in 1856; a school for girls was later opened in the same place.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\n====Other significant facts and dates====\n* Pre-December 1857: The ''Indian Land Chronicle'', Rock Hill's first newspaper, begins publishing.  After a change in ownership, it was renamed ''The Rock Hill Chronicle'' in 1860.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n* Pre-1860: Rock Hill had at least two doctors: Robert Hervey Hope and William Barron Fewell<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n\n===During the American Civil War===\n\nShortly before the [[American Civil War]] began a census had been taken of the population in York County, where Rock Hill is located. Half of the district's 21,800 residents were slaves, integral to local cotton production. The 4,379 white males in the county formed fourteen infantry companies; some of the men joined cavalry or artillery units instead. By the end of the war, 805 of these men were dead, and hundreds more were wounded. Men from Rock Hill and York County were involved in many of the major Civil War battles.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=35}}\n\nDue to its position on the railroad, Rock Hill became a transfer point for Confederate soldiers and supplies moving to and from the front. Since there was no local hospital, townspeople nursed sick and wounded soldiers in their homes. Refugees fleeing the coastal blockade or [[William T. Sherman|General Sherman's]] troops also came to Rock Hill.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}}\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1862, local area farmers switched from cotton to corn in order to produce more food.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}} Records show that prices in Rock Hill changed frequently during the war, reflecting both shortages and the inflation of the [[Confederate money|Confederate paper money]].<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}}\n\n[[P. G. T. Beauregard|Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard]] set up a temporary headquarters in Rock Hill on February 21, 1865.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}} He ordered the roads to Charlotte blocked to try to prevent General Sherman from reaching the city; Sherman ultimately went in a different direction.\n\nWhen [[Robert E. Lee|General Lee]] surrendered at the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], it was actually a future Rock Hill resident who was responsible for waving the white flag. Captain Robert Moorman Sims, a farmer from Lancaster County, was sent by [[James Longstreet|General James Longstreet]] to inform Union troops that the Confederate troops wanted a truce.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=42}}\n\n===Post-Civil War===\n\nThe Civil War changed the social, economic, and political situation in Rock Hill tremendously, as it did elsewhere in the South.  Rock Hill grew as a town, taking in war refugees, widows and their families, and the return of the men who had left to fight the war.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=58}} The formerly wealthy elite sold off their land to stay afloat financially.  Town life began to become more important than rural life.\n\nMost of the merchants in Rock Hill around 1870 were former Confederate soldiers; many were entrepreneurs who were new to town, trying to start over.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=59}} In 1870, even the largest stores in Rock Hill were only one storey tall, and there were no sidewalks on the roads. The first drug store in Rock Hill opened in the 1870s.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}} A locally contentious bordello was built in 1881 and introduced the town's first paved sidewalk.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}}\n\n===Incorporation===\n\nThe town was not officially incorporated until 1870, on the third try.\n\nThe first attempt to get Rock Hill incorporated was made in 1855. A petition, signed by major landholders and businessmen from the Rock Hill area, was presented to the General Assembly on October 19, 1855.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=29}} No action on the matter was taken by the General Assembly.\n\nThe second attempt was in 1868. In their petition, the townspeople claimed that Rock Hill had over 300 residents, \"eleven stores, two churches, two bars, two hotels, two carriage shops, three blacksmith shops, three shoe shops, one tannery, one cabinet shop, and elementary schools for white girls and boys.\" The petition was signed by 48 men, most relative newcomers to Rock Hill, with only a few members of the old, established, landed families. The larger landholders opposed incorporation because of the taxes it would bring.  They filed a counter-proposal which claimed that there were only 100 residents, many of them temporary.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=63}} The situation was a strong indication of the changes Rock Hill experienced as it transitioned from mostly farms to a business community. Ultimately, the state legislature did not act on either petition and Rock Hill was still not incorporated.\n\nThe third, successful petition was made in 1869, only one year after 1868's failed petition. This time there were 57 signers in favor of incorporation, with only seven opponents. The opponents collectively owned 80% of the land that would be incorporated into Rock Hill if the petition was successful. They were unsuccessful at preventing incorporation this time; Rock Hill was officially incorporated on February 26, 1870.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=64}}\n\n===Civil rights movement===\nRock Hill was the setting for two significant events in the [[civil rights movement]]. In February 1961, nine African-American men went to jail at the [[York County, South Carolina|York County]] prison farm after staging a [[sit-in]] at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[McCrory's]] lunch counter in downtown Rock Hill. The current location is now known as \"Five and Dine\" which has the names of the activists engraved. Their offense was reported to be \"refusing to stop singing hymns during their morning devotions.\" The event gained nationwide attention as the men followed an untried strategy called \"jail, no bail.\"<ref name=\"AP\"/> Rejecting bail was a way to lessen the huge financial burden which civil rights groups were facing as the [[sit-in movement]] spread across the South.<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite news |title=\u2019Sing-In\u2019 Negroes Eat Hearty; Say \u2018Jail\u2014No Bail\u2019 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Spartanburg Herald |date=February 21, 1961 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g3ssAAAAIBAJ&sjid=acwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7405,2802776&dq=rock+hill+sit-in&hl=en |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |quote=Eight Negro Demonstrators in a disciplinary cell at the York County Prison Camp accepted and ate second helpings Monday of the full meal given every third day to prisoners on bread and water. }}</ref> As their actions gained widespread national news coverage, the tactic was adopted by other civil rights groups.

Virginia|1960 ruling]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] outlawing racial segregation in all interstate public facilities. When the civil rights leader [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] and another black man stepped off the bus at Rock Hill, they were beaten by a white mob that was uncontrolled by police. The event drew national attention.\n\nIn 2002, Lewis, by then a US Congressman from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], returned to Rock Hill, where he had been invited as a speaker at [[Winthrop University]] and was given the [[key to the city]]. On January 21, 2008, Rep. Lewis returned to Rock Hill again and spoke at the city's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] holiday observance. Mayor Doug Echols officially apologized to him on the city's behalf for the Freedom Riders' treatment in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Thank you, my brother'|url = http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article12206531.html|website = Heraldonline.com|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref>\n[[File:Group of men and girls working in the Aragon Mill.

The prominent parks and outdoor facilities are listed below.\n*'''Cherry Park''', 70-acre park with a shaded 1.5-mile trail and athletic fields.\n*'''Ebenezer Park''', beachfront park located along Lake Wylie with swimming and picnic options.\n*'''Glencairn Garden''', quaint botanical garden featuring a variety of blooming flowers and trees.\n*'''Manchester Meadows''', large park with covered picnic areas and soccer fields.\n*'''Riverwalk & Rock Hill Outdoor Center''', 1,000 acre mixed-use community offering kayaking, hiking, mountain biking and home to the Giordana Velodrome and Rock Hill BMX Supercross track.\n*'''Westminster Park''', river-side park with miles of greenways and access to the Catawba River.\n\n[[File:Glencairn Gardens Rock Hill SC.jpg|thumb|Glencairn Garden in Rock Hill|alt=|left]]\n\nThere are also numerous parks located minutes from the city's downtown.\n*'''[[Nanny Mountain|Nanny Mountain County Park]]''', small mountain with short hiking trail and summit views.\n*'''[[Kings Mountain State Park]]''', state-operated park with numerous hiking and horseback riding trails.\n*'''[[Kings Mountain National Military Park]]''', historic park most famously known for the Battle of Kings Mountain.\n*'''[[Andrew Jackson State Park]]''', state-operated park surrounded by deciduous trees and a small lake.\n*'''[[Landsford Canal State Park]]''', state-operated park along the Catawba River famously known for the spider-lilies bloom of late May.\n*'''[[Crowders Mountain State Park]]''', highly visited mountain with summit views of Charlotte and adjacent York County.\n\n==Government==\nThe city operates under a Council-Manager form of government. The governing body is composed of a mayor and six members. The mayor is determined through a nonpartisan, at-large election for a four-year term of office while council members are chosen through nonpartisan, single-member district elections. Council members are elected to staggered four-year terms of office.\n\nThe city council is a legislative body, establishing policies with recommendations from the city administrator. The city manager acts as the chief administrator of the council's policies implemented through the administrative control of city departments given to him by ordinance.\n\n;Mayor\n\nJohn Gettys (term began January 2018)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article182774691.html|title=John Gettys: \u2018...We\u2019re on a trajectory that is lights out right now\u2019|website=Heraldonline.com|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Lauren Cholewinski]], Olympic speedskater<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://workingwomanreport.com/lauren-cholewinskis-olympic-dream/|title=Lauren Cholewinski's Olympic Dream \u2013 Working Woman Report|date=2014-01-05|work=Working Woman Report|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* [[Matt Christopher]], children's sports author<ref>Dale Christopher, ''Behind the Desk With Matt Christopher: The #1 Sportswriter for Kids,'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2004</ref>\n* [[Lafayette Currence]], baseball player\n* [[Emery (band)|Emery]] nationally known emo band\n* [[William G.

Its [[Rock Hill Downtown Historic District|historic downtown]] consist of twelve contiguous buildings built as early as 1840 offering dining and retail options. The city is also home to three colleges, including [[Winthrop University]], a public liberal arts university founded in 1886 which enrolls nearly 6,000 students annually.\n\n==History==\n[[File:U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (Rock Hill, South Carolina) 1933.jpg|thumb|right|Historic post office in Rock Hill]]\n\n===Pre-colonization===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nProceeding cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] lived in the Piedmont for thousands of years.  The historic [[Catawba Indian Nation]], a traditionally [[Siouan]]-speaking tribe, was here at the time of European encounter.  Currently the only tribe in South Carolina that is federally recognized, its members live near Rock Hill.\n\n===Early colonization===\n\nAlthough some European settlers had already arrived in the Rock Hill area in the 1830s and 1840s, Rock Hill did not become an actual town until the [[Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad]] Company made the decision to send a rail line through the area. Originally, the railroad had hoped to build a station in the nearby village of [[Ebenezer, South Carolina|Ebenezerville]] which was squarely between [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. When approached, however, the locals in Ebenezerville refused to have the railroad run through their village since they considered it dirty and noisy. Instead, engineers and surveyors decided to run the line two miles away by a local landmark. According to some, the engineers marked the spot on the map and named it \"rocky hill.\"<ref name=Willoughby>{{cite book|last=Willoughby|first=Lynn|title=The \"Good Town\" Does Well: Rock Hill, S.C., 1852\u20132002|year=2002|publisher=Written in Stone|location=Orangeburg, South Carolina|isbn=0-9669707-2-1}}</ref>{{RP|page=26}}\n\nSome of Rock Hill's early founding families\u2014the White family, the Black family, and the Moores\u2014believed that having a rail depot so close to them would be advantageous, so they decided to give the Columbia and Charlotte Railroad the right of way through their properties. As the three largest landowners in the area, this settled the matter. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|George Pendleton White]] contracted with the railroad to build a section of the line. Construction began in 1848. The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. A few weeks later, on April 17, 1852, the first Rock Hill Post Office opened.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=26\u201328}}\n\nNow that Rock Hill had a name, a railroad station, and a post office, it began to draw more settlers to the area. Captain J. H. McGinnis built a small general store near the station in 1849 or 1850 to provide supplies for the construction and railroad workers.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=27\u201328}} Templeton Black, who had leased the land to McGinnis, decided to devote some of his other adjacent land to building a larger town. He hired a local surveyor, Squire John Roddey, to organize a main street. Black sold his first plot of land along that street to Ira Ferguson for $125 a few weeks before the post office opened; other businessmen bought plots quickly after that.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\nRock Hill Academy, the first school in Rock Hill, opened in September 1854. Despite its official name, most residents referred to it as the Pine Grove Academy after the pine grove it was located in. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|Ann Hutchinson White]], wife of George White, donated the land to the school after her husband's death. The school had 60 male pupils in 1856; a school for girls was later opened in the same place.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\n====Other significant facts and dates====\n* Pre-December 1857: The ''Indian Land Chronicle'', Rock Hill's first newspaper, begins publishing.  After a change in ownership, it was renamed ''The Rock Hill Chronicle'' in 1860.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n* Pre-1860: Rock Hill had at least two doctors: Robert Hervey Hope and William Barron Fewell<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n\n===During the American Civil War===\n\nShortly before the [[American Civil War]] began a census had been taken of the population in York County, where Rock Hill is located. Half of the district's 21,800 residents were slaves, integral to local cotton production. The 4,379 white males in the county formed fourteen infantry companies; some of the men joined cavalry or artillery units instead. By the end of the war, 805 of these men were dead, and hundreds more were wounded. Men from Rock Hill and York County were involved in many of the major Civil War battles.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=35}}\n\nDue to its position on the railroad, Rock Hill became a transfer point for Confederate soldiers and supplies moving to and from the front. Since there was no local hospital, townspeople nursed sick and wounded soldiers in their homes. Refugees fleeing the coastal blockade or [[William T. Sherman|General Sherman's]] troops also came to Rock Hill.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}}\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1862, local area farmers switched from cotton to corn in order to produce more food.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}} Records show that prices in Rock Hill changed frequently during the war, reflecting both shortages and the inflation of the [[Confederate money|Confederate paper money]].<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}}\n\n[[P. G. T. Beauregard|Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard]] set up a temporary headquarters in Rock Hill on February 21, 1865.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}} He ordered the roads to Charlotte blocked to try to prevent General Sherman from reaching the city; Sherman ultimately went in a different direction.\n\nWhen [[Robert E. Lee|General Lee]] surrendered at the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], it was actually a future Rock Hill resident who was responsible for waving the white flag. Captain Robert Moorman Sims, a farmer from Lancaster County, was sent by [[James Longstreet|General James Longstreet]] to inform Union troops that the Confederate troops wanted a truce.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=42}}\n\n===Post-Civil War===\n\nThe Civil War changed the social, economic, and political situation in Rock Hill tremendously, as it did elsewhere in the South.  Rock Hill grew as a town, taking in war refugees, widows and their families, and the return of the men who had left to fight the war.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=58}} The formerly wealthy elite sold off their land to stay afloat financially.  Town life began to become more important than rural life.\n\nMost of the merchants in Rock Hill around 1870 were former Confederate soldiers; many were entrepreneurs who were new to town, trying to start over.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=59}} In 1870, even the largest stores in Rock Hill were only one storey tall, and there were no sidewalks on the roads. The first drug store in Rock Hill opened in the 1870s.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}} A locally contentious bordello was built in 1881 and introduced the town's first paved sidewalk.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}}\n\n===Incorporation===\n\nThe town was not officially incorporated until 1870, on the third try.\n\nThe first attempt to get Rock Hill incorporated was made in 1855. A petition, signed by major landholders and businessmen from the Rock Hill area, was presented to the General Assembly on October 19, 1855.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=29}} No action on the matter was taken by the General Assembly.\n\nThe second attempt was in 1868. In their petition, the townspeople claimed that Rock Hill had over 300 residents, \"eleven stores, two churches, two bars, two hotels, two carriage shops, three blacksmith shops, three shoe shops, one tannery, one cabinet shop, and elementary schools for white girls and boys.\" The petition was signed by 48 men, most relative newcomers to Rock Hill, with only a few members of the old, established, landed families. The larger landholders opposed incorporation because of the taxes it would bring.  They filed a counter-proposal which claimed that there were only 100 residents, many of them temporary.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=63}} The situation was a strong indication of the changes Rock Hill experienced as it transitioned from mostly farms to a business community. Ultimately, the state legislature did not act on either petition and Rock Hill was still not incorporated.\n\nThe third, successful petition was made in 1869, only one year after 1868's failed petition. This time there were 57 signers in favor of incorporation, with only seven opponents. The opponents collectively owned 80% of the land that would be incorporated into Rock Hill if the petition was successful. They were unsuccessful at preventing incorporation this time; Rock Hill was officially incorporated on February 26, 1870.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=64}}\n\n===Civil rights movement===\nRock Hill was the setting for two significant events in the [[civil rights movement]]. In February 1961, nine African-American men went to jail at the [[York County, South Carolina|York County]] prison farm after staging a [[sit-in]] at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[McCrory's]] lunch counter in downtown Rock Hill. The current location is now known as \"Five and Dine\" which has the names of the activists engraved.
