Weinberg's model, now known as the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak unification]] theory, had the same symmetry structure as that proposed by Glashow in 1961: hence both models included the then-unknown weak interaction mechanism between [[leptons]], known as [[neutral current]] and mediated by the [[Z boson]]. The 1973 experimental discovery of weak neutral currents<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haidt, D.|journal=CERN Courier|title=The discovery of the weak neutral currents|year=2004}}[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29168]</ref> (mediated by this Z boson) was one verification of the electroweak unification.\nThe paper by Weinberg in which he presented this theory is one of the most cited works ever in high energy physics.<ref>[[INSPIRE-HEP]]: [http://inspirehep.net/info/hep/stats/topcites/2015/alltime.html Top Cited Articles of All Time (2015 edition)]</ref>\n\nAfter his 1967 seminal work on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, Steven Weinberg continued his work in many aspects of particle physics, quantum field theory, gravity, [[supersymmetry]], [[superstrings]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], as well as a theory called [[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor]].\n\nIn the years after 1967, the full [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle theory was developed through the work of many contributors.  In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973 Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model which did not contain that model's fundamental Higgs boson.\n\nWeinberg became Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1973.\n\nIn 1979 he pioneered the modern view on the [[renormalization]] aspect of quantum field theory that considers all quantum field theories as [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] and changed the viewpoint of previous work (including his own in his 1967 paper) that a sensible quantum field theory must be renormalizable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Physica|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(79)90223-1|pages=327\u2013340|year=1979|title=Phenomenological Lagrangians|volume=96|issue=1\u20132|bibcode = 1979PhyA...96..327W }}</ref> This approach allowed the development of effective theory of quantum gravity,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Donoghue, J.

In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973 Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model which did not contain that model's fundamental Higgs boson.\n\nWeinberg became Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1973.\n\nIn 1979 he pioneered the modern view on the [[renormalization]] aspect of quantum field theory that considers all quantum field theories as [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] and changed the viewpoint of previous work (including his own in his 1967 paper) that a sensible quantum field theory must be renormalizable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Physica|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(79)90223-1|pages=327\u2013340|year=1979|title=Phenomenological Lagrangians|volume=96|issue=1\u20132|bibcode = 1979PhyA...96..327W }}</ref> This approach allowed the development of effective theory of quantum gravity,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Donoghue, J.

Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[David Bloor]], David Edge, [[Harry Collins]], [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], and [[Bruno Latour]].\n\nAlthough still teaching physics, he has, in recent years, turned his hand to the history of science, efforts that culminated in ''To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science'' (2015).<ref name = \"Wein NYRB Eye\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/eye-present-whig-history-science/|title = Eye on the Present\u2014The Whig History of Science|last = Weinberg|first = Steven |journal = The New York Review of Books|access-date = 9 February 2016|volume = 62 |number= 20 |pages = 82, 84 |year = 2015}}</ref> A hostile review<ref>{{Cite web |last= Shapin |first= Stephen |date= 13 February 2015 |title= Why Scientists Shouldn't Write History |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-to-explain-the-world-by-steven-weinberg-1423863226 |website= wsj.com |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}</ref> in the Wall Street Journal by [[Steven Shapin]] attracted a number of commentaries,<ref>{{Cite web |last= Bouterse |first= Jeroen |date= 31 May 2015 |title= Weinberg, Whiggism, and the World in History of Science |url= http://www.shellsandpebbles.com/2015/05/31/weinberg-whiggism-and-the-world-in-history-of-science/ |website= Shells and Pebbles |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}</ref> a response by Weinberg,<ref name = \"Wein NYRB Eye\"/> and an exchange of views between Weinberg and [[Arthur Silverstein]] in the ''NYRB'' in February 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Silverstein |first1= Arthur |last2= Weinberg |first2= Steven |year= 2016 |title= The Whig History of Science: An Exchange |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/02/25/the-whig-history-of-science-an-exchange/ |journal= The New York Review of Books |volume= 63 |number= 3 |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, he became a default figurehead for faculty and students opposed to a new law that allowed the carrying of concealed guns in UT classrooms.
