Learning French is like any other task, it can be difficult at first, but eventually, it becomes subconscious. The earlier the student can be exposed to it, the easier it will be grasped. Students that are in French Immersion schools complete the same curriculum subjects as other schools but have the advantage of learning a new language.\n\nThe French Immersion program was designed to take benefit of children's capacity to learn freely and smoothly. Also, take advantage of their communicative competence and open perspectives on language and society. Therefore, learning French becomes unconscious, and there is a heavy focus on understanding before pronouncing.\n\n\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board]]\n* [[:Category:High schools in Hamilton, Ontario|List of High Schools in Hamilton]]\n* [[List of school districts in Ontario]]\n* [[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{URL|https://www.hwcdsb.ca/board/policies/|Policies, Protocols and By-Laws}}\n* {{URL|https://www.hwcdsb.ca/board/meetingsminutes/|Public Meetings and Minutes}}\n\n{{Hamilton}}\n\n[[Category:Education in Hamilton, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic school districts in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Catholic school board}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox school district\n| name = Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board\n| logo = Hamilton-Wentworth CDSB logo.jpg\n| logo_alt = Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board logo\n| logo_caption = Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board logo\n| address = 90 Mulberry Street\n| city = [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]\n| province = [[Ontario]]\n| postalcode = [[Postal codes in Canada|L8R 2C8]]\n| country = Canada\n| coordinates = {{coord|43.26303|N|79.87055|W|type:edu_region:CA-ON|display=inline,title}}\n| type = [[Board of education|School Board]]\n| motto = Believing, Achieving, Serving\n| grades = [[Kindergarten|K]]\u2013[[Twelfth grade|{{Ordinal|12|sup=yes}}]]\n| established = {{Unbulleted list|{{Start date and age|1855}}|1969 (amalgamation)|1998 (present form)}}\n| chair_of_the_board = Patrick J.

Learning French becomes subconscious and creates a strong focus on understanding before speaking. Most students that enrol in French Immersion programs are not experts in French and often lack experience. Students in French immersion programs complete the same curriculum as students in non-immersion programs. \n\nThe French immersion was designed to: (a) capitalize on children's ability to learn language naturally and effortlessly; (b) take advantage of their social ability and open attitudes to language and culture; (c) reflect on the building blocks of language by emphasizing the use of languages for communication and (d) not stopping the children from participating in native language development, academic achievement or general cognitive development.<ref>{{Citation|title=French immersion|date=2020-03-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=French_immersion&oldid=945509120|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board]]\n* [[:Category:High schools in Hamilton, Ontario|List of High Schools in Hamilton]]\n* [[List of school districts in Ontario]]\n* [[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{URL|https://www.hwcdsb.ca/board/policies/|Policies, Protocols and By-Laws}}\n* {{URL|https://www.hwcdsb.ca/board/meetingsminutes/|Public Meetings and Minutes}}\n\n{{Hamilton}}\n\n[[Category:Education in Hamilton, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic school districts in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "Ellsmers", "label": "safe", "comment": "changed the paragraph of the Benefits of French Immersion Schools.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton-Wentworth_Catholic_District_School_Board"}
