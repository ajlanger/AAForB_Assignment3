The mud whiting was first described in 1985 and is currently known from the north west coast of [[Australia]] and the [[India]]n coast.\n\nAs its name suggests, mud whiting prefer [[mud]]dy or [[silt]]y substrates, and are commonly found in association with the [[banana prawn]].

Roland McKay reexamined the species during his revision of the Sillaginidae, determining it to be a new species and naming it ''Sillago lutea''. A specimen collected from [[Exmouth Gulf]] in [[Western Australia]] was assigned to be the [[holotype]] for the species.
