After his victory at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], [[Sterling Price]] and the [[Missouri State Guard]] moved further north into [[Missouri]].  A force of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops under [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] moved from [[Fort Scott, Kansas]] to attempt to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in Vernon County.  Price's Missouri State Guard troops outnumbered Lane's [[Kansas]] troops, and forced Lane to retreat to Fort Scott after a two hour skirmish.  In their retreat, Lane's troops abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missourians. Price followed up his victory by continuing his northward march, culminating in the [[Siege of Lexington]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Missouri]] was considered to be a [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]], as it was a [[Slavery in the United States|slavery was legal]] within the state, but it did not vote to [[Secession in the United States|secede]].  [[Governor of Missouri]] [[Claiborne F. Jackson]] supported the [[Confederate States of America]], and began to use [[militia]] to support the Confederate cause in Missouri by marching towards the [[arsenal]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].  [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Nathaniel Lyon]], commander of the Union forces in St. Louis, acted quickly by forcing Jackson's militia to surrender in the [[Camp Jackson affair]].  After the debacle at Camp Jackson, Jackson formed a new organization named the [[Missouri State Guard]] and appointed [[Sterling Price]] to command it.  Lyon moved to confront Price's new force, defeating it at the [[Battle of Boonville]].  Price and the Missouri State Guard retreated to the vicinity of [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] in southwestern Missouri, where it was joined by a [[Confederate States Army]] force commanded by Brigadier General [[Benjamin McCulloch]].  On August 10, Lyon decided to attack the combined forces of Price and McCulloch while they were encamped along [[Wilsons Creek, Missouri|Wilsons Creek]], despite being outnumbered by the Confederates and Missourians by a factor of over two-to-one.  In the ensuing [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], the Union forces were defeated and Lyon killed.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=19{{endash}}23}}\n\nAfter Wilson's Creek, the Union army retreated to [[Rolla, Missouri]].
