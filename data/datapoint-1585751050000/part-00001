It possibly resembled modern [[gorilla]]s, because of its supposedly similar lifestyle. Some scientists, however, think it probably looked more like its closest modern relative, the [[orangutan]]. Based on the upper estimates of its size, ''Gigantopithecus'' possibly had few or no enemies when fully grown. However, younger, weak, or injured individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by [[big cat]]s, large constrictor [[snake]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[machairodont]]s, [[hyena]]s, and ''H. erectus''.{{CN|date=February 2020}} Based on the lower estimates, however, even fully grown individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by all the animals mentioned above other than large [[snake]]s.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe majority view is that the weight of such a large, heavy animal would put enormous stress on the creature's legs, ankles, and feet if it walked bipedally; while if it walked on all four limbs, like [[gorilla]]s, its weight would be better distributed over each limb.\n\n==Paleobiology==\nThe genus lived in [[Asia]] and probably inhabited [[bamboo]] forests, since its fossils are often found alongside those of extinct ancestors of the [[giant panda]]. Most evidence points to ''Gigantopithecus'' being a herbivore. However, tooth enamel isotope analysis indicates it was not a bamboo specialist like pandas, but had a more generalist vegetarian diet more similar to that of orangutans.<ref name= \"Bocherens2017\" />\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaws of ''Gigantopithecus'' are deep and very thick.

The [[canine teeth]] are neither pointed nor sharp, while the [[incisor]]s are small, peglike, and closely aligned. The features of teeth and jaws suggested that the animal was adapted to chewing tough, fibrous food by cutting, crushing, and grinding it. ''Gigantopithecus'' teeth also have a large number of cavities.<ref name=\"Ciochon1991\"/>\n\nIn addition to bamboo, ''Gigantopithecus'' consumed other vegetable foods, as suggested by the analysis of the [[phytolith]]s adhering to its teeth.

This comes from the fact that many fossilized ''Gigantopithecus'' teeth contain eroded enamel, most likely the result of a diet that contained high amounts of acidic fruit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014-01-18|title=Real King Kong may have been brought down by fruit|url= |journal=New Scientist|language=en|volume=221|issue=2952|pages=14|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(14)60117-2|issn=0262-4079}}</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\n''Gigantopithecus'' may have become extinct approximately 300,000&nbsp;years ago, suggestions have been made that the climate change during the Pleistocene era changed the plants from forest to [[savanna]], and their food supply of fruits decreased.

It possibly resembled modern [[gorilla]]s, because of its supposedly similar lifestyle. Some scientists, however, think it probably looked more like its closest modern relative, the [[orangutan]]. Based on the upper estimates of its size, ''Gigantopithecus'' possibly had few or no enemies when fully grown. However, younger, weak, or injured individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by [[big cat]]s, large constrictor [[snake]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[machairodont]]s, [[hyena]]s, and ''H. erectus''.{{CN|date=February 2020}} Based on the lower estimates, however, even fully grown individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by all the animals mentioned above other than large [[snake]]s.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe majority view is that the weight of such a large, heavy animal would put enormous stress on the creature's legs, ankles, and feet if it walked bipedally; while if it walked on all four limbs, like [[gorilla]]s, its weight would be better distributed over each limb.\n\n==Paleobiology==\nThe genus lived in [[Asia]] and probably inhabited [[bamboo]] forests, since its fossils are often found alongside those of extinct ancestors of the [[giant panda]]. Most evidence points to ''Gigantopithecus'' being a herbivore. However, tooth enamel isotope analysis indicates it was not a bamboo specialist like pandas, but had a more generalist vegetarian diet more similar to that of orangutans.<ref name= \"Bocherens2017\" />\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaws of ''Gigantopithecus'' are deep and very thick. The molars are low-crowned and flat, and exhibit heavy enamel suitable for tough grinding.<ref name=\"Olejniczak2008\">{{cite journal |last1=Olejniczak |first1=A.J. |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Molar enamel thickness and dentine horn height in ''Gigantopithecus blacki'' |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=85\u201391 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20711 |pmid=17941103 |url=http://www.anthonyolejniczak.com/PDF/olejniczak_et_al_2008_AJPA_Gigantopithecus.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233645/http://www.anthonyolejniczak.com/PDF/olejniczak_et_al_2008_AJPA_Gigantopithecus.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> The [[premolar]]s are broad and flat and configured similarly to the [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s. The [[canine teeth]] are neither pointed nor sharp, while the [[incisor]]s are small, peglike, and closely aligned. The features of teeth and jaws suggested that the animal was adapted to chewing tough, fibrous food by cutting, crushing, and grinding it. ''Gigantopithecus'' teeth also have a large number of cavities.<ref name=\"Ciochon1991\"/>\n\nIn addition to bamboo, ''Gigantopithecus'' consumed other vegetable foods, as suggested by the analysis of the [[phytolith]]s adhering to its teeth. An examination of the microscopic scratches and gritty plant remains embedded in ''Gigantopithecus'' teeth suggests that they fed on seeds and fruit, as well as bamboo.<ref name=\"Poirier1999\"/>\n\nAfter changes in climate during the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene era]], ''Gigantopithcus'' may have changed to a diet more reliant on fruit due to bamboo becoming more scarce. This comes from the fact that many fossilized ''Gigantopithecus'' teeth contain eroded enamel, most likely the result of a diet that contained high amounts of acidic fruit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014-01-18|title=Real King Kong may have been brought down by fruit|url= |journal=New Scientist|language=en|volume=221|issue=2952|pages=14|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(14)60117-2|issn=0262-4079}}</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\n''Gigantopithecus'' may have become extinct approximately 300,000&nbsp;years ago, suggestions have been made that the climate change during the Pleistocene era changed the plants from forest to [[savanna]], and their food supply of fruits decreased.
