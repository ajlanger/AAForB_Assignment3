I got suspended from the Irish team after going to race in South Africa, so I would definitely have been in the team for the Olympics, so missed the 1976 Games. Then I decided to go to France.\n\nTowards the end of that year in France I got offered a contract by de Gribaldy.

In terms of training, he was a long way ahead. In those times, riders did unbelievable miles on the bike. They\u2019d go out and do 5 and 6 hour marathons every day.\n\nIn my time, he was the guy who\u2019d make you do shorter rides of quality as well as a long mid-week ride. That was 10 years before specialised training programmes \u2013 I realised this because I\u2019d been through it already, so he had some unbelievable qualities.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{in lang|fr}} Pierre Di\u00e9terl\u00e9, ''Jean de Gribaldy, la l\u00e9gende du Vicomte'', Editions du Sekoya, 2014  {{ISBN|978-2-84751-137-6}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n* [http://jeandegribaldy.com/ jeandegribaldy.com], a complete site about Jean de Gribaldy (French)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021738/http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1962 Cyclismag: Le Vicomte conteur] (French)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021855/http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1963 Cyclismag: De Gri, le d\u00e9couvreur de p\u00e9pites] (French)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021903/http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=1964 Cyclismag: Bouts d'ficelle] (French)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gribaldy, Jean De}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Besan\u00e7on]]\n[[Category:French male cyclists]]\n[[Category:Tour de France cyclists]]\n", "text_old": "{{use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox cyclist\n| name          = Jean de Gribaldy\n| image         = Jean de Gribaldy \u00e0 Besan\u00e7on, septembre 1980.jpg\n| caption       = Jean de Gribaldy, [[Besan\u00e7on]], September 1980\n| fullname      = Jean de Gribaldy\n| nickname      = Le Vicomte\n| birth_date    = 18 July 1922\n| birth_place   = [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[France]]\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|1987|1|2|1922|7|18|df=yes}}\n| death_place   = [[Voray-sur-l'Ognon]], France\n| discipline    = Road\n| role          = Rider/Team leader\n| ridertype     = Climber\n| amateuryears1 =\n| amateurteam1  =\n| proyears1     = 1945\u20131949\n| proteam1      = [[Peugeot-Dunlop|Peugeot - Dunlop]]\n| proyears2     = 1950\n| proteam2      = Mervil\n| proyears3     = 1951\u20131954\n| proteam3      = Terrot\n| manageyears1  = 1964\n| manageteam1   = Grammont - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears2  = 1965\n| manageteam2   = {{allow wrap|Grammont - Motoconfort / {{nowrap|Tigra - Meltina - de Gribaldy}} / {{nowrap|Wolhauser Sirops Berger}}}}\n| manageyears3  = 1966\n| manageteam3   = Tigra - Meltina - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears4  = 1967\n| manageteam4   = Tigra - Grammont / Tigra - Enicar\n| manageyears5  = 1968\n| manageteam5   = Frimatic - Viva - de Gribaldy/Tigra - Enicar\n| manageyears6  = 1969\n| manageteam6   = Frimatic - Viva - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears7  = 1969\n| manageteam7   = {{allow wrap|{{nowrap|Frimatic - Viva - de Gribaldy - Wolber}} (Tour de France)}}\n| manageyears8  = 1970\n| manageteam8   = Wolhauser - Ravis - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears9  = 1970\n| manageteam9   = Frimatic - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears10 = 1971\n| manageteam10  = Hoover - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears11 = 1972\n| manageteam11  = Van Cauter - Magniflex - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears12 = 1975\n| manageteam12  = Miko - de Gribaldy\n| manageyears13 = 1976\n| manageteam13  = Miko - de Gribaldy - Superia\n| manageyears14 = 1977\n| manageteam14  = [[Flandria (cycling team)|Velda - Latina Assicurazioni - Flandria]]\n| manageyears15 = 1978\n| manageteam15  = [[Flandria (cycling team)|Velda - Lano-Flandria]]\n| manageyears16 = 1979\n| manageteam16  = [[Flandria (cycling team)|Flandria - CA VA SEUL]]\n| manageyears17 = 1980\n| manageteam17  = [[Sem-France Loire|Puch - Sem - Campagnolo]]\n| manageyears18 = 1981\n| manageteam18  = [[Sem-France Loire|Sem - France Loire - Campagnolo]]\n| manageyears19 = 1982\n| manageteam19  = [[Sem-France Loire|Sem - France Loire - Campagnolo]]\n| manageyears20 = 1983\n| manageteam20  = [[Sem-France Loire|Sem- France Loire - Mavic - Reydel]]\n| manageyears21 = 1984\n| manageteam21  = [[Skil-Sem (cycling team)|Skil - Sem - Mavic - Reydel]]\n| manageyears22 = 1985\n| manageteam22  = [[Skil-Sem (cycling team)|Skil - Reydel - Sem]]\n| manageyears23 = 1986\n| manageteam23  = [[Kas (cycling team)|Kas - Mavic - Tag Heuer]]\n}}\n'''Jean de Gribaldy''' (18 July 1922 &ndash; 2 January 1987) was a [[France|French]] road [[cyclist]] and [[directeur sportif]].
