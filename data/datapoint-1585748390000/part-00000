Only 15 percent of Canadians live in a different province from where they were born, and only 10 percent go to another province for university. Canada has always been like that, and stands in sharp contrast to the United States' internal mobility which is much higher. For example 30 percent live in a different state from where they were born, and 30 percent go away for university. [[Scott Gilmore]] in ''[[Maclean's]]'' argues that \"Canada is a nation of strangers\", in the sense that for most individuals, the rest of Canada outside their province is little-known.

These themes, and Canada's literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from [[Leonard Cohen]] to [[Margaret Atwood]].\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Canadian writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada's literature, from [[Hugh MacLennan]]'s ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' (1945) to [[Alistair MacLeod]]'s ''[[No Great Mischief]]'' (1999). Canadian literature is often categorized by [[List of regions of Canada|region or province]]; by the socio-cultural origins of the author (for example, [[Acadians]],  indigenous peoples, LGBT, and [[Irish Canadian]]s); and by literary period, such as \"Canadian postmoderns\" or \"Canadian Poets Between the Wars\".\n\nCanadian authors have accumulated numerous international awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertfulford.com/CanadianNovelists.html |title=Robert Fulford's column about the international success of Canadian literature |publisher=Robertfulford.com |date=June 6, 2001 |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> In 1992, [[Michael Ondaatje]] became the first Canadian to win the [[Man Booker Prize]] for ''[[The English Patient]]''.<ref name=\"BrackettGaydosik2006\">{{cite book|author1=Mary Virginia Brackett|author2=Victoria Gaydosik|title=The Facts on File Companion to the British Novel: Beginnings through the 19th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkiNBQXP65EC&pg=RA1-PA323|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-5133-5|page=323}}</ref> [[Margaret Atwood]] won the Booker in 2000 for ''[[The Blind Assassin]]''<ref name=\"HengenThomson2007\">{{cite book|author1=Shannon Eileen Hengen|author2=Ashley Thomson|title=Margaret Atwood: a reference guide, 1988\u20132005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf1SSS2jIpMC&pg=PA272|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5904-3|page=272}}</ref> and [[Yann Martel]] won it in 2002 for the ''[[Life of Pi]]''.<ref name=\"Martel2010\">{{cite book|author=Yann Martel|title=Beatrice and Virgil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzSzJP3qLwsC&pg=PA212|year= 2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8129-8197-1|page=212}}</ref> [[Carol Shields]]'s ''[[The Stone Diaries]]''  won the [[Governor General's Awards]] in Canada in 1993,  the 1995 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], and the 1994 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]].<ref name=\"Werlock2001\">{{cite book|author=Abby H.

Only 15 percent of Canadians live in a different province from where they were born, and only 10 percent go to another province for university. Canada has always been like that, and stands in sharp contrast to the United States' internal mobility which is much higher. For example 30 percent live in a different state from where they were born, and 30 percent go away for university. [[Scott Gilmore]] in ''[[Maclean's]]'' argues that \"Canada is a nation of strangers\", in the sense that for most individuals, the rest of Canada outside their province is little-known.  Another factor is the cost of internal travel. Intra-Canadian airfares are high\u2014it is cheaper and more common to visit the United States than to visit another province.

These themes, and Canada's literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from [[Leonard Cohen]] to [[Margaret Atwood]].\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Canadian writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada's literature, from [[Hugh MacLennan]]'s ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' (1945) to [[Alistair MacLeod]]'s ''[[No Great Mischief]]'' (1999).
