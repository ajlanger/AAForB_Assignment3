She held the position for two years. In the position, she was charged with investigating possible cases of police misconduct, including police shootings of civilians. However, a [[Chicago Tribune]] report found that the Office of Professional Standards' investigations often lacked thoroughness. Lightfoot says her recommendations for disciplinary action were often rejected by the police department.<ref name=\"ChiReader\" />\n\nIn one notable case, Lightfoot went against Police Department orthodoxy by recommending the firing of officer Alvin Weems, who shot and killed an unarmed man, Michael Pleasance. Weems was initially believed to have accidentally shot Pleasance, but after video evidence contradicting the initial claims was revealed, even Weems himself expressed feeling that the shooting was unjustified. Weems was not fired by the Chicago Police Department, but the city was eventually forced to pay a settlement to the Pleasance family. Weems later committed suicide.<ref name=\"Trib-Complicated\" />\n\nIn another controversial case where officer Phyllis Clinkscales shot and killed unarmed 17-year-old Robert Washington, the Chicago Tribune reported that Lightfoot determined that the shooting was justified.

During her mayoral campaign, Lightfoot cited several reasons for entering public service, including a desire to represent the African-American community, a sense of injustice based on the murder of a family member by a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member in the 1920s, and her older brother's struggles with the law.<ref name=\"ChiReader\" />\n\nWhile working as a federal prosecutor, Lightfoot helped to prosecute those accused of federal crimes, including drug crimes.<ref name=\"STbio\" /> She assisted with [[Operation Silver Shovel]], an FBI investigation into Chicago corruption.

She held the position for two years. In the position, she was charged with investigating possible cases of police misconduct, including police shootings of civilians. However, a [[Chicago Tribune]] report found that the Office of Professional Standards' investigations often lacked thoroughness. Lightfoot says her recommendations for disciplinary action were often rejected by the police department.<ref name=\"ChiReader\" />\n\nIn one notable case, Lightfoot went against Police Department orthodoxy by recommending the firing of officer Alvin Weems, who shot and killed an unarmed man, Michael Pleasance. Weems was initially believed to have accidentally shot Pleasance, but after video evidence contradicting the initial claims was revealed, even Weems himself expressed feeling that the shooting was unjustified. Weems was not fired by the Chicago Police Department, but the city was eventually forced to pay a settlement to the Pleasance family. Weems later committed suicide.<ref name=\"Trib-Complicated\" />\n\nIn another controversial case where officer Phyllis Clinkscales shot and killed unarmed 17-year-old Robert Washington, the Chicago Tribune reported that Lightfoot determined that the shooting was justified. In doing so, the Tribune said she reversed the order of her predecessor, who had called for Clinkscales' firing. Clinkscales' account of the events of the shooting had been found to contain untrue statements in an investigation.<ref name=\"Trib-Complicated\" /> Lightfoot disputes this account of Clinkscales' case, saying that the police superintendent at the time was responsible for declining Lightfoot's predecessor's finding that the shooting was unjustified.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wall |first1=Craig |title=Lori Lightfoot responds to accusations she covered up police-involved shooting in 2000 |url=https://abc7chicago.com/politics/lori-lightfoot-responds-to-accusations-she-covered-up-police-involved-shooting/5204010/ |website=ABC7 Chicago |accessdate=April 1, 2019 |language=en |date=March 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401074013/https://abc7chicago.com/politics/lori-lightfoot-responds-to-accusations-she-covered-up-police-involved-shooting/5204010/ |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lightfoot said her action on the case was to push for a 30-day suspension for Clinkscales, which she implied was the most that was possible given the circumstances.<ref name=\"reporter-policing\">{{cite web |last1=Black |first1=Curtis |title=Lightfoot\u2019s long, complicated record on policing easy to distort |url=https://www.chicagoreporter.com/lightfoots-long-complicated-record-on-policing-easy-to-distort/ |website=Chicago Reporter |accessdate=April 1, 2019 |date=March 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401074011/https://www.chicagoreporter.com/lightfoots-long-complicated-record-on-policing-easy-to-distort/ |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Other roles in Chicago city government (2004\u201305) ===\nLightfoot then moved on to work in the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications.
