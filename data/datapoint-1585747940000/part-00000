WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, a [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in the [[collapse of Qin]]. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebel. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the Han leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] Hegemon-King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). Han would eventually won [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|its conflict]] with Chu and emerge as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] established by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated. As Ying retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]], the King of Changsha pretended to assist him in his escape to Nanyue but instead killed him in Cixiang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8332\u9109}}}},}} ''C\u00edxi\u0101ng'') near Poyang.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=106}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWu Chen was succeeded by his son Wu Hui {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u56de}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Hu\u00ed''). Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue. However, in the hot and humid summer, a plague broke out in the Han army, hindering its advance. The campaign was eventually cancelled with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself. Changsha was administered as an imperial [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] thereafter.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}\n\n==Territory==\n[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|Silk map unearthed from Mawangdui, showing Changsha and the neighboring kingdom of [[Nanyue]].]]\n\nThe exact extent of the first Changsha Kingdom is still unclear. The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the vassal kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly responsible for the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0'')&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was only in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}} The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') were similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9'') who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king for the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the high status of the court clerk was similar to that of the [[Warring States]] rather than the Han central government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties. Two circuits{{mdash}}He ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9f55}}}}, ''H\u00e9'') and Ling ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6ce0}}}}, ''L\u00edng''){{mdash}}are noted on the map unearthed at Mawangdui. Counties were each headed by a [[county magistrate|magistrate]] and were subdivided into [[township (China)|townships]] and villages ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u91cc}}}}, ''l\u01d0'') in the same manner as in centrally administered territories of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=151}}\n\nThe reestablishment of the Changsha Kingdom under Liu Fa coincided with the abortive [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent drastic measures to limit the autonomy of kingdoms by Emperor Jing.

WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, a [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in the [[collapse of Qin]]. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebel. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the Han leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] Hegemon-King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). Han would eventually won [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|its conflict]] with Chu and emerge as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] established by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated. As Ying retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]], the King of Changsha pretended to assist him in his escape to Nanyue but instead killed him in Cixiang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8332\u9109}}}},}} ''C\u00edxi\u0101ng'') near Poyang.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=106}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWu Chen was succeeded by his son Wu Hui {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u56de}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Hu\u00ed''). Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue.

The campaign was eventually cancelled with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself.

The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the vassal kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly responsible for the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0'')&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was only in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}} The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') was similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9'') who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king for the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the high status of the court clerk was similar to that of the [[Warring States]] rather than the Han central government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties.
