Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair]], it originally opened in 1976 as one of two parks built by the [[Marriott Corporation]]. The park has appeared in 1994 films ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' and ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' and features over 40 rides and attractions. One of its most notable attractions, [[Gold Striker]], has been featured as a top-ranked wooden roller coaster in ''[[Amusement Today|Amusement Today's]]'' annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Also featured is Railblazer, one of the first Raptor roller coasters by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]] in the world, and Flight Deck, a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster.\n\n==History==\n\n===Marriott & KECO Era (1976\u20131992)===\nMarriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator [[Marriott Corporation]], opened to the public on March 20, 1976.<ref>{{cite news |title=Photos: A look back at 40 years of California's Great America |date=March 27, 2015 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/27/photos-a-look-back-at-40-years-of-californias-great-america/}}</ref> Less than two months later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America&nbsp;\u2013 later known as [[Six Flags Great America]]&nbsp;\u2013 north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Six Flags purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/marriott-to-sell-park-to-bally.html|title=Marriott to Sell Park to Bally|date=April 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Marriott's Great America (Maryland\u2013Virginia)|A third park]] was initially planned for the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]], but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.<ref name=\"3rd Great America\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19770819&id=j95NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5660,2451015|title=Marriott's high-powered approach|last=Flattau|first=Edward|date=August 19, 1977|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Great america.jpg|thumb|left|View of California's Great America from above]]\nThe park, though profitable, was still an earnings disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, '''Caz Development Co.''', appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing {{convert|55|acre}} of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing homebuilding on the land by Caz Development would lower home values of existing homeowners, the city council approved a $101 million purchasing agreement on January 31, 1984, by a 4\u20133 vote that also had to be approved by city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the [[Superior Court of Santa Clara County]] to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6\u20131 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained {{convert|20|acre}} from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.\n\n[[Kings Entertainment Company]], who owned and operated other amusement parks, was hired in 1985 to manage Great America for the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19850620&id=KNZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aB0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,5468771|title=A New Start At Great America|date=June 20, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Modesto, CA}}</ref> In 1989, the city decided to return the park to the private sector and sold it to Kings Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California}}</ref> In the agreement, the city would earn 5% of all revenue that exceeds $56 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Paramount Parks Era (1992\u20132006)===\n[[Image:Paramountgreatamerica.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used from 2003 until its sale to Cedar Fair.]]\nThree years later Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), the owners of [[Paramount Pictures]], sought to join other entertainment companies as a theme park owner. The company acquired Kings Entertainment, owner of three parks including Great America, and one other park for $400 million and created [[Paramount Parks]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], the parent of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (including [[Nickelodeon]]), then bought Paramount in 1994, allowing Nickelodeon theming and merchandise into the park as well. During the Paramount era, attractions from the Action FX Theatre, Nickelodeon Splat City (later Nickelodeon Central), Drop Zone Stunt Tower, Invertigo, and many more modern thrill ride attractions were added in. Because the park is landlocked in the center of Silicon Valley, several rides including the classic train ride and the [[Sky Whirl]], a Marriott's Great America signature attraction, were removed to make way for newer attractions.\n\nIn its last years as a Paramount Park, Great America was co-owned with several broadcasting stations in the Bay Area, including [[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]].\n\n===Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:Great America 2007.PNG|thumb|right|Logo used in 2006.

For the 2008 season, the park saw the addition of a [[Huss Rides]] top spin ride called FireFall, a new ice show in the \"Great America Theatre\" (formerly The Paramount Theatre), and the addition of the Halloween Haunt event to the park.<ref>[http://www2.cedarfair.com/greatamerica/news/detail.cfm?item_id=652 Great America | San Francisco's Themed Amusement Park<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116231626/http://www2.cedarfair.com/GreatAmerica/news/detail.cfm?item_id=652 |date=November 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Cedar Fair announced that all the Nickelodeon themed areas would be replaced with ''[[Peanuts]]'' themed areas.

Most of the Sky Whirl/Triple Wheel stunts (renamed \"The Spider\" for the film) were filmed in a studio.

Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair]], it originally opened in 1976 as one of two parks built by the [[Marriott Corporation]]. The park has appeared in 1994 films ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' and ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' and features over 40 rides and attractions. One of its most notable attractions, [[Gold Striker]], has been featured as a top-ranked wooden roller coaster in ''[[Amusement Today|Amusement Today's]]'' annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Also featured is Railblazer, one of the first Raptor roller coasters by [Rocky Mountain Construction]] in the World, and Flight Deck, a [Bolliger & Mabillard] inverted coaster.\n\n==History==\n\n===Marriott & KECO Era (1976\u20131992)===\nMarriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator [[Marriott Corporation]], opened to the public on March 20, 1976.<ref>{{cite news |title=Photos: A look back at 40 years of California's Great America |date=March 27, 2015 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/27/photos-a-look-back-at-40-years-of-californias-great-america/}}</ref> Less than two months later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America&nbsp;\u2013 later known as [[Six Flags Great America]]&nbsp;\u2013 north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Six Flags purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/marriott-to-sell-park-to-bally.html|title=Marriott to Sell Park to Bally|date=April 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Marriott's Great America (Maryland\u2013Virginia)|A third park]] was initially planned for the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]], but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.<ref name=\"3rd Great America\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19770819&id=j95NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5660,2451015|title=Marriott's high-powered approach|last=Flattau|first=Edward|date=August 19, 1977|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Great america.jpg|thumb|left|View of California's Great America from above]]\nThe park, though profitable, was still an earnings disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, '''Caz Development Co.''', appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing {{convert|55|acre}} of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing homebuilding on the land by Caz Development would lower home values of existing homeowners, the city council approved a $101 million purchasing agreement on January 31, 1984, by a 4\u20133 vote that also had to be approved by city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the [[Superior Court of Santa Clara County]] to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6\u20131 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained {{convert|20|acre}} from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.\n\n[[Kings Entertainment Company]], who owned and operated other amusement parks, was hired in 1985 to manage Great America for the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19850620&id=KNZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aB0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,5468771|title=A New Start At Great America|date=June 20, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Modesto, CA}}</ref> In 1989, the city decided to return the park to the private sector and sold it to Kings Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California}}</ref> In the agreement, the city would earn 5% of all revenue that exceeds $56 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Paramount Parks Era (1992\u20132006)===\n[[Image:Paramountgreatamerica.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used from 2003 until its sale to Cedar Fair.]]\nThree years later Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), the owners of [[Paramount Pictures]], sought to join other entertainment companies as a theme park owner. The company acquired Kings Entertainment, owner of three parks including Great America, and one other park for $400 million and created [[Paramount Parks]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], the parent of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (including [[Nickelodeon]]), then bought Paramount in 1994, allowing Nickelodeon theming and merchandise into the park as well. During the Paramount era, attractions from the Action FX Theatre, Nickelodeon Splat City (later Nickelodeon Central), Drop Zone Stunt Tower, Invertigo, and many more modern thrill ride attractions were added in. Because the park is landlocked in the center of Silicon Valley, several rides including the classic train ride and the [[Sky Whirl]], a Marriott's Great America signature attraction, were removed to make way for newer attractions.\n\nIn its last years as a Paramount Park, Great America was co-owned with several broadcasting stations in the Bay Area, including [[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]].\n\n===Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:Great America 2007.PNG|thumb|right|Logo used in 2006.

He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million.\n\nSome modifications were made to the Columbia Carousel and Vortex roller coaster. Most of the Sky Whirl/Triple Wheel stunts (renamed \"The Spider\" for the film) were filmed in a studio. To film the exterior scenes, the motors of the Triple Wheel were left unpowered; instead, to ensure the ride did not move too quickly, some cages were loaded with sandbags to unbalance the mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/10/eddie-murphys-dangerous-ride/ |title=Eddie Murphy's dangerous ride |author=Mannes, George |date=June 10, 1994 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> In this scene, [[George Lucas]] has a small part as the man Axel cuts in front of to get on the ride, also known as 'disappointed man' (this can be seen in the credits).

Also, the carousel at the back of the park (the Ameri-Go-Round, not the Columbia Carousel) was altered. The Ameri-Go-Round carousel has since been removed and Drop Zone is now in its place. The tunnels that supposedly ran under the park are a myth as well. No tunnels run under the park, as many thought after this was released.\n\nThe Alien Attack ride featured in the Wonder World theme park was in fact the \"Earthquake: The Big One attraction\" from the [[Universal Studios Florida]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]].
