The station is owned by [[Cumulus Media]]. WKRU's studios are located on Victoria Street in Green Bay. while its transmitter is located in the eastern part of Green Bay.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasts in December 1996, when Jack LeDuc resurrected the '''WJLW''' call letters and its [[country music]] format one year after selling its previous home at [[WKSZ-FM|95.9 FM]].  LeDuc ran WJLW until March 1998, when he decided to sell a second time.  The new owners, [[Cumulus Media]], changed the station to \"106.7 The Eagle,\" airing a [[classic rock]] format.  By the mid 2000s, some current rock songs would be inserted into the format, with the station billing themselves as \"The Rock of Green Bay.\"\n\nMajor changes would occur at the station in March 2007, as Cumulus changed the call letters to WZNN and dismissed the on-air staff.  \"The Eagle\" ended on the night of March 5 when, after an hour of music from [[The Eagles]] (ending with \"Hotel California\"), the station [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunted]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070927181731/http://www.wisconsinbroadcasting.com/Format%20Change%20Files/WZNN%20Starts%20Stunting.mp3] with construction site noise.

In billing themselves as \"Green Bay's only true alternative\", WZNN's move was aimed to set the station apart from the traditional [[mainstream rock|mainstream]]/[[classic rock]] stations in the area.  \"The Zone\" would also air the syndicated ''[[Mancow's Morning Madhouse]]'' program during morning drive time.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, WZNN changed its call sign to WKRU, rebranded as \"KRUZ @ 106.7,\" and adopted a new [[adult album alternative]] format.
