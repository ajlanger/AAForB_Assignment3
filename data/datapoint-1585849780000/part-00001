Mansfield Center, CT: Creative Learning Press.</ref> although as yet there is no empirical research to confirm this theory. The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:\n* Bright but not trying hard enough\n* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities\n* Average\nIn the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.\nA 2e student's grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn't trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.\nThis struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.\n\n==Identifying twice exceptionality==\nTwice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments. The following chart summarizes characteristics commonly seen in this population.\n\n{| border=1; align=\"center\" cellpadding=3px cellspacing=1px\n  |+ '''Some common characteristics of twice-exceptional children'''<ref>Higgins, L.

In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student's performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.\n\nIf these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.<ref>Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.</ref> Evaluation results should indicate the child's areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29\u201336|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}</ref>\n\n==Support==\nTheir strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|504 plan]].\n\nSupport can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child's areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. The student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.\n\nSchool counselors have a unique role in supporting 2e students. Counselors are positioned to be a valuable resource for teachers, other school personnel, and community members who might not be familiar with twice-exceptionality. Foley-Nicpon and Assouline (2015) conducted a systematic review of the existing research regarding 2e students.<ref name=\"sdsu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

Their results indicated that gifted individuals with ASD can have very high general, verbal, and/or nonverbal ability and simultaneous weaknesses in memory and the ability to process information. They also found that 2e individuals with ASD may generally have both high ability and significant differences in their ability and achievement profiles, including weaknesses in processing information quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

The 2e education approach is backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students.

Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}</ref>\n\nWhen teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward \"big picture\" learning{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. These students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended.\n\nStill, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority.

The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:\n* Bright but not trying hard enough\n* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities\n* Average\nIn the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.\nA 2e student's grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn't trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.\nThis struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.\n\n==Identifying twice exceptionality==\nTwice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments. The following chart summarizes characteristics commonly seen in this population.\n\n{| border=1; align=\"center\" cellpadding=3px cellspacing=1px\n  |+ '''Some common characteristics of twice-exceptional children'''<ref>Higgins, L.

In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student's performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.\n\nIf these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.<ref>Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.</ref> Evaluation results should indicate the child's areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29\u201336|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}</ref>\n\n==Support==\nTheir strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|504 plan]].\n\nSupport can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child's areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. The student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.\n\nSchool counselors have a unique role in supporting 2e students. Counselors are positioned to be a valuable resource for teachers, other school personnel, and community members who might not be familiar with twice-exceptionality. Foley-Nicpon and Assouline (2015) conducted a systematic review of the existing research regarding 2e students.<ref name=\"sdsu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

Their results led them to conclude that a comprehensive evaluation is critical to obtaining a full understanding of 2e students\u2019 academic, social, and emotional needs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Doobay |first2=A.

Furthermore, they should help clients advocate for a comprehensive evaluation if one has not been obtained.<ref name=\"sdsu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Foley Nicpon, Assouline, and Stinson used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) to examine the cognitive and academic profiles of fifty-two 2e students with ASD. Their results indicated that gifted individuals with ASD can have very high general, verbal, and/or nonverbal ability and simultaneous weaknesses in memory and the ability to process information. They also found that 2e individuals with ASD may generally have both high ability and significant differences in their ability and achievement profiles, including weaknesses in processing information quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

Change in therapy may happen more slowly with twice-exceptional clients. They also suggest that counselors recommend or offer accelerative opportunities within 2e students\u2019 talent domains.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

The 2e education approach is backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students. It is a marriage between special education and gifted education\u2014a strengths-based, differentiated approach that provides special educational supports. Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}</ref>\n\nWhen teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward \"big picture\" learning{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. These students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended.\n\nStill, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority. For this reason, a number of parents choose [[alternative education]]al options for their 2e children, including [[homeschooling]] and [[virtual schools]].<ref>Neumann, L. C. (2008).
