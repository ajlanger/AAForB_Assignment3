A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, [[Pope Gregory I]] heard that the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of [[Santa Agata in Suburra]]. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Aelian Bridge]], the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, wiping the blood from his sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.<ref>Account of [[Pedro Tafur]] in [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch3 ''The Travels of Pero Tafur'' (1435\u20131439)], Chapter III.</ref>\n\n[[File:View from Castel Sant'Angelo 10 (15442805966).jpg|thumb|250px|View from the top of the Castel Sant'Angelo towards the ancient city core of Rome.]]\n\n==Papal fortress, residence and prison==\nThe popes converted the structure into a castle, beginning in the 14th century; [[Pope Nicholas III]] connected the castle to [[St Peter's Basilica]] by a covered fortified corridor called the ''[[Passetto di Borgo]].'' The fortress was the refuge of [[Pope Clement VII]] from the siege of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s [[Landsknecht]]e during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)]], in which [[Benvenuto Cellini]] describes strolling the ramparts and shooting enemy soldiers.\n\n[[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] built a chapel with a ''Madonna'' by [[Raffaello da Montelupo]]. In 1536 Montelupo also created a marble statue of [[Saint Michael]] holding his sword after the 590 plague (as described [[#Destruction|above]]) to surmount the Castel.<ref>''Rome'' (Eyewitness Travel Guides) DK Publishing, London (2003) p. 242</ref> Later [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] built a rich apartment, to ensure that in any future siege the pope had an appropriate place to stay.\n\nMontelupo's statue was replaced by a bronze statue of the same subject, executed by the Flemish sculptor [[Peter Anton von Verschaffelt]], in 1753. Verschaffelt's is still in place and Montelupo's can be seen in an open court in the interior of the Castle.\n\nThe Papal state also used Sant'Angelo as a prison; [[Giordano Bruno]], for example, was imprisoned there for six years. Another prisoner was the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]]. Executions were performed in the small inner courtyard. As a prison, it was also the setting for the third act of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s 1900 opera ''[[Tosca]]''; the eponymous heroine leaps to her death from the Castel's ramparts.\n\n==Museum==\nDecommissioned in 1901, the castle is now a museum: the ''Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo''.
