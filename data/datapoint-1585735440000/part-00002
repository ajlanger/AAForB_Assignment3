[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]], and \"New Age\" in a general sense, which emerged in the later 1970s\n{{quote|when increasing numbers of people ... began to perceive a

There is also some suggestion that the benefits associated with spirituality and religiosity might arise from being a member of a close-knit community. Social bonds available via secular sources (i.e.,  not unique to spirituality or faith-based groups) might just as effectively raise well-being.
