Since her career beginnings as an independent artist, Del Rey has recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on webcams and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \"homemade music videos\", a style which helped gained her early recognition. Following her early success, Del Rey had a series of high budget music videos including the videos for \"Born To Die\" and \"National Anthem\" (both 2012) and \"Young and Beautiful\" (2013), both of which incorporated elements of 90s cult films while paying tribute to aspects of Americana and New York hip-hop cultures. Her following videos for tracks such as \"Summer Wine\", \"Carmen\", and \"Summertime Sadness\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The ''Ultraviolence'' era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the ''Honeymoon'' era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \"Pretty When You Cry\" and \"Honeymoon\" going unreleased due to Del Rey stating they were \"too boring\" with \"nothing happening\" in them. The ''Lust For Life'' era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For ''Norman Fucking Rockwell'', Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \"homemade video\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic manner, as he had the videos on ''Lust for Life''\n\nSince her debut, Del Rey has repeatedly collaborated with the same people on her visuals. Among the most notably include directors Anthony Mandler, Rich Lee, Anthony Schumer, Jake Nava, and Francesco Carrozzini, as well as photographers Chuck Grant and Neil Krug. She has also used the same love interests in her videos more than once, most notably [[Bradley Soileau]] (appeared in three videos) and [[Mark Mahoney]] (appeared in two), while her backup dancers Kira Alger and Alexa Kaye have appeared in four and five videos, respectively.\n\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.<ref name=caramanica>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/music/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-live-review.html|work=The New York Times|title=Review: Lana Del Rey, a Character No More|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author=Caramanica, Jon}}</ref> A September 2017 concert review published in ''The New York Times'' noted: \"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\"<ref name=caramanica/> Another review by Roy Train published in ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in 2014 noted \"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/concert-review-lana-del-rey-708719|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Lana Del Rey Will be Your Mirror: Concert Review|last=Trakin|first=Roy|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Public image==\n===Early reception===\n[[File:Lana Del Rey @ Plaza.jpg|upright|left|thumb|250px|Del Rey performing at [[Irving Plaza]] in June 2012]]\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album ''Born to Die'' in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/8679-the-imagination-of-lana-del-rey|work=Pitchfork|title=The Imagination of Lana Del Rey|date=September 30, 2011|author=Abebe, Nitsuh|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref name=stranger/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/|work=Spin|title=Deconstructing Lana Del Rey|date=January 30, 2012|author=Hopper, Jessica|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> One article by Paul Harris published by ''The Guardian'' just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.<ref name=stranger>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/21/lana-del-rey-pop|work=The Guardian|title=Lana Del Rey: The strange story of the star who rewrote her past|author=Harris, Paul|date=January 21, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Harris wrote: <blockquote>The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom.

This reveals a cultural obsession with the \"authenticity\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.<ref name=\"stranger\"/></blockquote>[[Blockhead (music producer)|Tony Simon]], a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\"<ref name=hellyer/> In Del Rey's own words, she \"[n]ever had a persona.

Her 2019 promotional single \"[[Looking for America (song)|Looking for America]]\" was released amidst the back-to-back mass shootings in [[2019 El Paso shooting|El Paso]] and [[2019 Dayton shooting|Dayton]].

Since her career beginnings as an independent artist, Del Rey has recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on webcams and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \"homemade music videos\", a style which helped gained her early recognition. Following her early success, Del Rey had a series of high budget music videos including the videos for \"Born To Die\" and \"National Anthem\" (both 2012) and \"Young and Beautiful\" (2013), both of which incorporated elements of 90s cult films while paying tribute to aspects of Americana and New York hip-hop cultures. Her following videos for tracks such as \"Summer Wine\", \"Carmen\", and \"Summertime Sadness\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The ''Ultraviolence'' era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the ''Honeymoon'' era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \"Pretty When You Cry\" and \"Honeymoon\" going unreleased due to Del Rey stating they were \"too boring\" with \"nothing happening\" in them. The ''Lust For Life'' era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For ''Norman Fucking Rockwell'', Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \"homemade video\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic manner, as he had the videos on ''Lust for Life''\n\nSince her debut, Del Rey has repeatedly collaborated with the same people on her visuals. Among the most notably include directors Anthony Mandler, Rich Lee, Anthony Schumer, Jake Nava, and Francesco Carrozzini, as well as photographers Chuck Grant and Neil Krug. She has also used the same love interests in her videos more than once, most notably [[Bradley Soileau]] (appeared in three videos) and [[Mark Mahoney]] (appeared in two), while her backup dancers Kira Alger and Alexa Kaye have appeared in four and five videos, respectively.\n\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.<ref name=caramanica>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/music/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-live-review.html|work=The New York Times|title=Review: Lana Del Rey, a Character No More|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author=Caramanica, Jon}}</ref> A September 2017 concert review published in ''The New York Times'' noted: \"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\"<ref name=caramanica/> Another review by Roy Train published in ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in 2014 noted \"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/concert-review-lana-del-rey-708719|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Lana Del Rey Will be Your Mirror: Concert Review|last=Trakin|first=Roy|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Public image==\n===Early reception===\n[[File:Lana Del Rey @ Plaza.jpg|upright|left|thumb|250px|Del Rey performing at [[Irving Plaza]] in June 2012]]\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album ''Born to Die'' in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/8679-the-imagination-of-lana-del-rey|work=Pitchfork|title=The Imagination of Lana Del Rey|date=September 30, 2011|author=Abebe, Nitsuh|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref name=stranger/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/|work=Spin|title=Deconstructing Lana Del Rey|date=January 30, 2012|author=Hopper, Jessica|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> One article by Paul Harris published by ''The Guardian'' just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.<ref name=stranger>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/21/lana-del-rey-pop|work=The Guardian|title=Lana Del Rey: The strange story of the star who rewrote her past|author=Harris, Paul|date=January 21, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Harris wrote: <blockquote>The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom.

This reveals a cultural obsession with the \"authenticity\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.<ref name=\"stranger\"/></blockquote>[[Blockhead (music producer)|Tony Simon]], a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\"<ref name=hellyer/> In Del Rey's own words, she \"[n]ever had a persona.

I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off.
