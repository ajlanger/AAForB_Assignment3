It tells the true story of [[Walter McMillian]], who, with the help of young defense attorney [[Bryan Stevenson]], appeals his murder conviction.

Pictures]] on December 25, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, and Foxx received a nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]] at the [[26th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, idealistic young [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] graduate [[Bryan Stevenson]] travels to [[Alabama]] hoping to help fight for poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. He meets with Eva Ansley and founds the [[Equal Justice Initiative]], then travels to a prison to meet its [[death row]] inmates. He meets [[Walter McMillian|Walter \"Johnny D.\" McMillian]], an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, a white woman. Stevenson looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers, who provided highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own pending trial.\n\nStevenson's first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid; Chapman dismisses him without even looking at Stevenson's notes. Stevenson then asks McMillian family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he was with a witness who corroborated Myers' testimony the day of the murder, which would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart. When Stevenson submits Houston's testimony, police arrest him for perjury. While Stevenson is able to get the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated into refusing to testify in court.\n\nStevenson then approaches Myers himself, who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after police played to his fear of being burned and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillan a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught, Stevenson vents his frustrations about the case to Ansley. He appears on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rally public support in favor of McMillan, then appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillan his retrial. Stevenson then motions to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects him from his property. The day of the motion comes, and Stevenson appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to join him in his motion, the case is dismissed, and McMillan is finally reunited with his family.\n\nAn epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue to fight for justice to the present day. Until his death in 2013, McMillan remained friends with Stevenson. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's death confirmed McMillan's innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been solved.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael B.

It tells the true story of [[Walter McMillian]], who, with the help of young defense attorney [[Bryan Stevenson]], appeals his murder conviction. The film is based on the memoir of the same name, written by Stevenson.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://justmercy.eji.org |title=Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson {{!}} Bestselling Book and Adapted Film |website=JustMercy.eji.org |language=en-US |access-date=2019-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191120183622/https://justmercy.eji.org/ |archive-date=November 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Just Mercy'' had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2019, and was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on December 25, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, and Foxx received a nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]] at the [[26th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, idealistic young [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] graduate [[Bryan Stevenson]] travels to [[Alabama]] hoping to help fight for poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. He meets with Eva Ansley and founds the [[Equal Justice Initiative]], then travels to a prison to meet its [[death row]] inmates. He meets [[Walter McMillian|Walter \"Johnny D.\" McMillian]], an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, a white woman. Stevenson looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers, who provided highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own pending trial.\n\nStevenson's first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid; Chapman dismisses him without even looking at Stevenson's notes. Stevenson then asks McMillian family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he was with a witness who corroborated Myers' testimony the day of the murder, which would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart. When Stevenson submits Houston's testimony, police arrest him for perjury. While Stevenson is able to get the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated into refusing to testify in court.\n\nStevenson then approaches Myers himself, who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after police played to his fear of being burned and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillan a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught, Stevenson vents his frustrations about the case to Ansley. He appears on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rally public support in favor of McMillan, then appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillan his retrial. Stevenson then motions to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects him from his property. The day of the motion comes, and Stevenson appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to join him in his motion, the case is dismissed, and McMillan is finally reunited with his family.\n\nAn epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue to fight for justice to the present day. Until his death in 2013, McMillan remained friends with Stevenson. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's death confirmed McMillan's innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been solved.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael B.
