He was a son of Omer William Schietekat, a textile manufacturer, and Paula Sylvia Snoeck. In 1961, he married Maria Magdalena Vereecke (Myl\u00e8ne), and together they had three children, a twin Jan and Paul in 1963 and in 1966 [[Sophie]]. He died in a car accident in [[Pittem|Egem]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAt the Nuns Catholic School in Berkenboom he was considered a mediocre student. He went to high school at the ''Sint-Lievenscollege'' in [[Antwerp]] and the ''Sint-Jozef Klein Seminarie'' in Sint-Niklaas, where he had [[Anton van Wilderode]] as a teacher. As a young boy he already showed interest in nature and painting. During the war his father earned a living making paintings that he sold to the local farmers or exchanged for food. For a while he studied [[law]] and [[philology]] at the [[University of Ghent]]. In 1955, together with [[Hugues C. Pernath]], he founded the avant-garde journal the ''Gard Sivik'' (civil guard).\n\n==Career==\nAfter his military service in [[Germany]] (1956\u20131957) he decided to become a full-time artist, yet he soon changed his mind. He started working in his father's textile factory and visited several countries as a salesman. In 1963, he founded his own import - and export company of Japanese printed silk. Afterwards he became sales director in a company specialized in pile foundations. In 1967 he bought a farm in [[Slijpe]] and started to paint again in 1972, this time with more success. Several exhibitions followed. His paintings sold so well that he started working part-time for Atlas and then, in 1975, fully committed himself to painting. Paul Snoek became an editor of the ''Nieuw Vlaams Tijdschrift''. In his free time he collected antiques and was an amateur [[motocross]] rider. He was a close friend of [[Gaston Burssens]].\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Arkprijs van het Vrije Woord]] 1963.\n* ''Driejaarlijkse Staatsprijs voor de Vlaamse po\u00ebzie'' 1969 for ''De zwarte muze''.\n* ''Jan Campert-prijs'' 1971.\n* ''Eug\u00e8ne Baie-prijs'' 1972.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Paul Snoek - Een zwemmer is een ruiter.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Poem by Paul Snoek in swimming pool 'De Zijl' in [[Leiden]]]]\n* ''Archipel'' (poetry, 1954)\n* ''Noodbrug'' (poetry, 1955)\n* ''Tussen vel en vlees'' (poetry, 1956)\n* ''Aardrijkskunde'' (poetry, 1956)\n* ''Reptielen en amfibie\u00ebn'' (prose, 1957)\n* ''Ik rook een vredespijp'' (poetry, 1957)\n* ''De heilige gedichten'' (poetry, 1959)\n* ''Hercules'' (poetry, 1960)\n* ''Richelieu'' (poetry, 1961)\n* ''Soldatenbrieven'' (prose, together with Hugues C.
