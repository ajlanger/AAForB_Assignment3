As a teenager, she experimented with drugs and ended up living in several care homes after she ran away from her family at the age of fourteen. Anouk's interest in music was triggered through her mother, who was a blues singer. Anouk gave her first performance at fifteen and sang at weddings and parties with the band Shotgun Wedding. She started attending the [[Codarts|Rotterdam Conservatory]] in 1994 but dropped out two years later. In the same period, her then-husband and manager [[Edwin Jansen]] introduced Anouk to [[Golden Earring]] frontman [[Barry Hay]]. Hay believed her to have talent and offered to write some songs for her. One of those songs was \"Mood Indigo\"; written in collaboration with fellow Golden Earring member [[George Kooymans]].\n\nAfter she met [[Bart van Veen]], her co-writer, the pair wrote a few songs. On 5 September 1997, she released her second single, \"[[Nobody's Wife (song)|Nobody's Wife]]\", which remained at the top of the Dutch music charts for a number of weeks and was also a hit in Norway and Sweden. Her debut album ''[[Together Alone (Anouk album)|Together Alone]]'' turned out to be a huge success. In 1998, Anouk won two awards from Dutch music channel [[The Music Factory|TMF]] in addition to an [[Edison Award]]. During the summer, she played at various festivals. Her second album ''[[Urban Solitude]]'' was released in November 1999, and included the single \"[[R U Kiddin' Me]]\". This song reached the Dutch Top 100. Shortly afterwards, Anouk went to the United States to pursue a record deal. Negotiations with her American [[record producer|label]] (Sony) ended badly, causing her to return to the Netherlands without a deal. She released a new song, \"[[Don't (Anouk song)|Don't]]\", and began touring the Netherlands in February 2001.\n\n[[File:Anouk op Lowlands 2006.jpg|thumb|Anouk at [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands festival]] in 2006]]\nIn March 2001, she released another album, ''[[Lost Tracks (Anouk album)|Lost Tracks]]'', which contained acoustic versions and B-sides from older songs, and various duets with [[K's Choice]] singer [[Sam Bettens]] and [[Remon Stotijn|The Anonymous Mis]]. She was awarded the [[Popprijs]] award in 2001. In November 2002, the album ''[[Graduated Fool]]'' was released. This is the heaviest rock album in Anouk's career so far.\nAnouk received a [[Golden Harp]] in 2003. The following full-length release is called ''[[Hotel New York]]'' (2004) and yielded a total of four singles: \"Girl\", \"Lost\", \"Jerusalem\" and \"One Word\".

As a teenager, she experimented with drugs and ended up living in several care homes after she ran away from her family at the age of fourteen. Anouk's interest in music was triggered through her mother, who was a blues singer. Anouk gave her first performance at fifteen and sang at weddings and parties with the band Shotgun Wedding. She started attending the [[Codarts|Rotterdam Conservatory]] in 1994 but dropped out two years later. In the same period, her then-husband and manager [[Edwin Jansen]] introduced Anouk to [[Golden Earring]] frontman [[Barry Hay]]. Hay believed her to have talent and offered to write some songs for her. One of those songs was \"Mood Indigo\"; written in collaboration with fellow Golden Earring member [[George Kooymans]].\n\nAfter she met [[Bart van Veen]], her co-writer, the pair wrote a few songs. On 5 September 1997, she released her second single, \"[[Nobody's Wife (song)|Nobody's Wife]]\", which remained at the top of the Dutch music charts for a number of weeks and was also a hit in Norway and Sweden. Her debut album ''[[Together Alone (Anouk album)|Together Alone]]'' turned out to be a huge success. In 1998, Anouk won two awards from Dutch music channel [[The Music Factory|TMF]] in addition to an [[Edison Award]]. During the summer, she played at various festivals. Her second album ''[[Urban Solitude]]'' was released in November 1999, and included the single \"[[R U Kiddin' Me]]\". This song reached the Dutch Top 100. Shortly afterwards, Anouk went to the United States to pursue a record deal. Negotiations with her American [[record producer|label]] (Sony) ended badly, causing her to return to the Netherlands without a deal. She released a new song, \"[[Don't (Anouk song)|Don't]]\", and began touring the Netherlands in February 2001.\n\n[[File:Anouk op Lowlands 2006.jpg|thumb|Anouk at [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands festival]] in 2006]]\nIn March 2001, she released another album, ''[[Lost Tracks (Anouk album)|Lost Tracks]]'', which contained acoustic versions and B-sides from older songs, and various duets with [[K's Choice]] singer [[Sam Bettens]] and [[Remon Stotijn|The Anonymous Mis]]. She was awarded the [[Popprijs]] award in 2001. In November 2002, the album ''[[Graduated Fool]]'' was released. This is the heaviest rock album in Anouk's career so far.\nAnouk received a [[Golden Harp]] in 2003. The following full-length release is called ''[[Hotel New York]]'' (2004) and yielded a total of four singles: \"Girl\", \"Lost\", \"Jerusalem\" and \"One Word\". In 2006 she won the [[3FM]] award for best Dutch female singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blikopnieuws.nl/bericht/21448|title=Racoon grote winnaar bij 3FM Awards|date=13 March 2006|publisher=Blik op Nieuws|accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref> In 2007, Anouk released ''[[Who's Your Momma]]'', recorded with producer [[Glen Ballard]].
