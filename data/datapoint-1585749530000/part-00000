Chandru and Krishna Murthy are orphans who are brought up by Aravind's parents. Aravind's sister Amrita (Pratyusha) falls in love with Chandru. Chandru hesitates to reciprocate as she is the sister of his close friend. Chandru seeks the help of Krishna Murthy to avoid Amrita. Later, Aravind and Chandru go to Hyderabad to work with Krishna Murthy. When this trio is assigned to renovate an old palatial house, Aravind encounters Padmini ([[Bhumika Chawla]]), later falling in love with her. When Padmini gets engaged to another man, Chandru feels that Padmini cheated Aravind after loving him. Aravind and Padmini realize that Padmini's jealous cousin is responsible for their split. Subsequently, Aravind's jealous cousin lies to Chandru that Aravind intentionally killed Chandu's brother when they were young. In an ensuing struggle, Aravind falls from a cliff and gets paralysed and goes into a coma. Although Chandru tried to save Aravind, he blames himself for Aravind's fall. Chandru later realizes that his brother was in fact accidentally killed, and that Chandru wasn't intentionally at fault. A few years later, Chandru reunites with Aravind after the latter recovers from his paralysis and is in coma no more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Akkineni Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna Akkineni]] as Aravind\n* [[Sumanth]] as Chandrasekhar / Chandru\n* [[Bhumika Chawla]] as Padmini\n* [[Prathyusha]] as Amrutha\n* [[Betha Sudhakar|Sudhakar]] as Krishna Murthy / Kimoo\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Bhavani Shankar\n* [[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as Gopal\n* [[Venu Madhav (actor)|Venu Madhav]]\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Manager Appalaraju\n* [[Jaya Prakash Reddy]] as Padmini's Uncle\n* [[Chalapathi Rao]] as Aravind's father\n* [[Giri Babu]] as Aravind's Uncle and Gautham's father\n* [[Narra Venkateswara Rao]] as Padmini's Father's Friend\n* [[Rami Reddy (actor)|Rami Reddy]] as Puliraju\n* [[Sriman (actor)|Sriman]] as Gowtham - Aravindh's cousin\n* Lakshmi Rathan\n* Ramatherdha\n* Gowtham Raju as Watchman\n* Gadiraju Subba Rao\n* Lakhamshetty Nageswara Rao\n* [[Sangeeta (Telugu actress)|Sangeetha]] as Aravind's Mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Aravind's Aunt  \nand Gautham's mother\n* Sana as Padmini's Aunt\n* [[Abhinayashree|Abhinayasri]] as Swathi\n* [[Rama Prabha]] as Padmini's Grandmother\n* [[Telangana Shakuntala]]\n* Saraswatamma as Aravind's Grandmother\n* Master Kireeti as Young Aravind\n* Master Tanush as Young Chandru\n* Master Vijay as Young Kimoo\n* Master Abhinai as Chinna\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Snehamante Idera\n| type         = film\n| artist       = [[Shiva Shankar]]\n| cover        =\n| released     = 2001\n| recorded     = \n| genre        = Soundtrack\n| length       = 29:41\n| label        = [[Aditya Music]]\n| producer     = [[Shiva Shankar]]\n}}\nThe music was composed by [[Shiva Shankar]].
