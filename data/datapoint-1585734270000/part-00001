Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to.<ref>{{cite web |title=See the history of changes made to a file |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843 |website=Docs editors Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref>\nAn editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats ([[OpenDocument|ODF]], [[HTML]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[Formatted text|Text]], [[Office Open XML]]). Files can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes.\n\n==== Explore ====\nIn March 2014, Google introduced add-ons; new tools from third-party developers that add more features for Google Docs.<ref>{{cite web |first=Saurabh |last=Gupta |title=Bring a little something extra to Docs and Sheets with add-ons |url=https://drive.googleblog.com/2014/03/add-ons.html |website=Google Drive Blog |publisher=Google |date=March 11, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref>\nIn order to view and edit documents offline on a computer, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser.

Comparing Google's office suite with [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft]]'s and [[iWork|Apple]]'s, he stated that \"Docs exists ''only'' in your Web browser\", meaning that users have \"more limited feature set\" than \"the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app\". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as \"less convenient than a desktop app, and you have to remember to install it before you need it\". Mendelsohn praised the [[user interface]], describing it as \"elegant, highly usable\" with \"fast performance\", and that the revision history \"alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions\". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the \"niftiest new feature\" in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Word files as \"impressive fidelity\".

Comparing Google's office suite with [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft]]'s and [[iWork|Apple]]'s, he stated that \"Docs exists ''only'' in your Web browser\", meaning that users have \"more limited feature set\" than \"the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app\". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as \"less convenient than a desktop app, and you have to remember to install it before you need it\". Mendelsohn praised the [[user interface]], describing it as \"elegant, highly usable\" with \"fast performance\", and that the revision history \"alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions\". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the \"niftiest new feature\" in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Word files as \"impressive fidelity\". He summarized by praised Docs and the Drive suite for having \"the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too\", while noting that \"it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Mendelsohn |title=Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides |url=https://www.pcmag.com/review/349586/google-docs-sheets-and-slides |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310115437/http://www.pcmag.com/review/349586/google-docs-sheets-and-slides |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 6, 2016 |archivedate=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n=== 2017 phishing incident ===\nIn May 2017, a phishing attack impersonating a Google Docs sharing email spread on the Internet. The attack sent emails pretending to be someone the target knew, requesting to share a document with them. Once the link in the email was pressed, users were directed to a real Google account permissions page where the phishing software, a third-party app named \"Google Docs\", requested access to the user's Google account. Once granted, the software received access to the user's [[Gmail]] messages and address book, and sent new fraudulent document invitations to their contacts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Adi |last=Robertson |title=Google Docs users hit with sophisticated phishing attack |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15534768/google-docs-phishing-attack-share-this-document-with-you-spam |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 3, 2017 |accessdate=May 4, 2017}}</ref>\nThe phishing attack was described by media outlets as \"massive\"<ref name=\"tnw-phishing\">{{cite web |first=Napier |last=Lopez |title=Massive Google Docs phishing attack swept the internet today [Updated] |url=https://thenextweb.com}}</ref> and \"widespread\",<ref>{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Levin |title=Google Docs users hit with sophisticated phishing attack in their inboxes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/03/google-docs-phishing-attack-malware |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 3, 2017 |accessdate=May 4, 2017}}</ref> and ''The Next Web''{{'}}s Napier Lopez wrote that it's \"very easy to fall for\".<ref name=\"tnw-phishing\"/> One of the reasons the attack was so effective was that its email messages passed through spam and security software, and used a real Google address.<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Steinberg |authorlink= |title=Do Not Open the Google Docs Email You Receive Today: It May Be a Scam |url=https://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/do-not-open-the-google-docs-email-you-receive-today-it-may-be-a-scam.html |website=[[Inc.
