The group restored the dirt strip, converting it from dirt into a grass runway. In addition to fixing the runway, the group has secured a parking/tie-down area (paved with concrete), and has added a picnic area situated within walking distance to the parking/tie-down area overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn the 1940s, a small aircraft landing strip was built at Camp McQuaide so airplanes could drop targets into the ocean.
