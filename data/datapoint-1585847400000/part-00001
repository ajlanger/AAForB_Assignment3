February 10, 1528 (?) - d. July 1583), also known as '''Sultan Baabullah''' (or '''Babu''' [Baab] in Europan sources) was the 7th [[Sultan]] and 24th ruler of the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] in [[Maluku islands|Maluku]] who ruled between 1570 and 1583. He was known as the greatest Sultan in Ternatan and Malukan history, who defeated the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] occupants in Ternate and led the Sultanate to a golden peak at the end of the 16th century. Sultan Babullah was commonly known as the ruler of 72 inhabited islands in eastern Indonesia, including most of the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]] and parts of [[Sulawesi]], with influences as far as [[Solor]], [[Bima|East Sumbawa]], [[Mindanao]], and the [[Raja Ampat|Papuan Islands]].<ref>Robert Cribb (2000) ''Historical atlas of Indonesia''.

According to the later chronicle of Na\u00efdah, he was the foster son of the Sultan of Bacan.<ref>Na\u00efdah (1878), p. 449.</ref> Since a young man he also accompanied his father, helping him to run the affairs of government and the sultanate. He is known in contemporary Portuguese sources as the heir to the throne (''herdeiro do reino''), though certain later sources say that he had one or two brothers with more legitimate claims.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. I, Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 61; C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16-7.</ref>\n\nTernate, an important center for the [[spice trade|trade]] in [[cloves]], had been heavily dependent on the Portuguese since 1522, when they built a stone fort on the island.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 117.</ref> The Ternatan elite at first cooperated with the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] foreigners whose superior weaponry and possession of the trading entrepot of [[Melaka]] made then useful allies. However, the behavior of the Portuguese commanders and soldiery soon evoked resentment. Sultan Hairun lived in an uneasy relationship with the Portuguese captains who nevertheless assisted him in defeating the other sultantes in [[North Maluku]], [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] and [[Jailolo]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 122; P.A. Tiele IV:1, p. 399-400.</ref> A Ternatan-Portuguese conflict broke out in the 1560s, since Muslims in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] appealed for assistance from the sultan against the Europeans, who at this time were bent on Christianizing the island. Sultan Hairun sent a war fleet under Prince Baab who appeared before the Christian village Nusaniwi in 1563 and demanded its surrender. However, the siege had to be lifted as three Portuguese ships appeared.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:1, p. 405.</ref> For a time after 1564, the Portuguese were forced to leave Ambon altogether, although they came back and established a stronghold in 1569.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974), p. 12.</ref> Moreover, Baab undertook an expedition to the northern parts of Sulawesi in 1563 in order to bring these lands under his father's realm. The Portuguese authorities in Maluku understood that this would be paired with the dissemination of Islam and therefore detrimental to their position in the East Indies, and efforts were made to convert populations in [[Menado]], [[Siau Island]], Kaidipang, Toli-Toli, etc. to Christianity.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:3, p. 418-20, IV:5, p. 440.</ref>\n\nIn spite of all these conflicts, the Ternate-Portuguese relationship was not entirely broken. The officer Gonsalo Pereira led an expedition to the [[Philippines]] in 1569, where the rulers of Tidore, Bacan and Ternate were summoned to participate. Prince Baab showed up with fifteen ''korakoras'' (large outriggers). However, since Ternate had little interest in this venture, Baab diverted on the way and brought his fleet to the [[Melaka Straits]] where he performed acts of piracy. He nevertheless lost 300 men in the enterprise. The Portuguese enterprise in the Philippines likewise turned out to be a failure, to the ill-concealed satisfaction of Hairun.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:5, p. 438.</ref>\n\n== The death of Sultan Hairun ==\nAfter the contest for Ambon Island, Hairun strengthened his power year by year which worried the Portuguese leaders. Portuguese-influenced areas in [[Halmahera]] were attacked by his forces. Since he dominated the waterways he could stop the vital deliveries of foodstuff from Moro in Halmahera to the Portuguese settlement in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:4, p. 441-3.</ref> In 1570 Captain Diogo Lopes de Mesquita (1566-1570) undertook an official reconciliation with the sultan, but the atmosphere was still tense.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 86-7.</ref> Apparently the Portuguese peace appeal was only for gaining time to consolidate their strength, waiting for the right moment to repay Ternate.\n\nOn the pretext of discussing an urgent issue, Lopes de Mesquita invited Hairun to the fortress of S\u00e3o Paulo on 25 February 1570 for a meal. The sultan complied with the invitation and entered unattended, since his bodyguards were not allowed in. A nephew of the captain, Martim Afonso Pimentel, was posted just inside the gate. As the sultan came inside, Pimentel pierced him with his dagger and the  victim fell down dying.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 87.</ref> Mesquita assumed that by removing Hairun, Maluku would lose its only prominent leader and resistance be scattered. Here, however, he underestimated the anti-Portuguese resentment which had built up during the last decades, in particular canalized through Prince Baab.\n\n== Ascendance of Sultan Babullah ==\n=== Coronation as Sultan ===\nThe tragic death of Sultan Hairun triggered the anger of the Ternatans as well as the various kings of Maluku. The royal council, with the support of the people, brought forth Kaicili Baab as the next Sultan of Ternate, who carried the title of ''Sultan Babullah Datu Syah''. The new Sultan aimed to fight for reestablishing the banner of [[Islam]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and make [[Ternate Sultanate]] into a powerful kingdom, and to force the Portuguese out of his kingdom.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Announcement of Jihad ===\nSultan Babullah did not waste any time after his inauguration. The sacred war or [[Jihad]] was announced throughout the realm. No less than his father he emerged as a capable coordinator of different ethnic and cultural groups in the eastern archipelago. To strengthen his position, Sultan Babullah married a sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16.</ref> Some of the other Maluku Kings temporarily forgot their rivalry and united under one command under Sultan Babullah and the banner of Ternate, as did a number of kings and chiefs in the larger region. Sultan Babullah's cause was helped by a number of capable commanders, such as the King of Jailolo, the governor of [[Sula Islands|Sula]] Kapita Kapalaya, the Ambonese leader Kapita Kalakinka, and Kapitan Rubuhongi. According to Spanish sources, Sultan Babullah was able to mobilize 2,000 kora-kora and 133,300 soldiers under his banner, drawn from a vast area from [[Sulawesi]] to [[New Guinea]].<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887) \"De Europ\u00ebers in den Maleischen Archipel\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 25-35, Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> Although the numbers are debatable, they indicate the wide reach of his power and prestige.\n\n== Portuguese expulsion ==\n{{main | Portuguese-Ternate wars}}\nAfter the assassination of Hairun, Sultan Babullah demanded the handover of Lopes de Mesquita for trial. Portuguese fortresses in Ternate, namely Tolucco, Saint Lucia and Santo Pedro fell within short, leaving only the S\u00e3o Paulo Citadel as the residence of Mesquita. At the behest of Babullah the Ternate forces besieged S\u00e3o Paulo and severed its relationship with the outside world; the food supply was restricted to small rations of [[sago]], so that the inhabitants of the fort could just barely survive. The Ternatans nevertheless tolerated occasional contacts between the besieged and the islanders - it should be recalled that a lot of Ternatans had married Portuguese people and lived in the fort with their families. In their depressed state the Portuguese received Alvaro de Ataide as their new captain, replacing Lopes de Mesquita. This move did, however, alter Babullah's determination to oust the Europeans.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p.88-91. </ref>\n\nAlthough the siege of S\u00e3o Paulo was not pushed with full force, Sultan Babullah did not forget his oath. His forces attacked areas where the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] mission had made progress, and forced the baptized ruler of Bacan to revert to Islam in about 1575. He also took the war to Ambon where the Portuguese had constructed a fortress in 1569. In 1571 the 30-strong Ternate fleet, containing 3,000 troops under the leadership of Kapita Kalakinka (Kalakinda), invaded Ambon. The Ternatans managed to subjugate Hoamoal (in [[Seram Island|Ceram]]), [[Ambelau]], [[Manipa]], [[Kelang]] and [[Boano]]. The Portuguese troops under the captaincy of Sancho de Vasconcellos could keep their fortress with great difficulty, and lost much of their grip over the trade in cloves.<ref>Gerrit Knaap (2004) ''Kruidnagelen en Christenen: De VOC en de bevolking van Ambon 1656-1696''. Leiden: KITLV Press, p. 17-9.</ref> Vasconcellos, assisted by the Christian natives succeeded in repelling the troops of Ternate on [[Buru Island]] for a while but soon fell after Ternate renewed its assault under the leadership of Kapitan Rubuhongi.\n\nBy 1575 most the Portuguese positions in Maluku had fallen, and the indigenous tribes or kingdoms that had supported them were badly corned. There remained the S\u00e3o Paulo fortress that was still under siege. For five years the Portuguese and their families suffered a hard life in the castle, cut off from the outside world. Sultan Babullah finally gave an ultimatum to leave Ternate within 24 hours. Those who were indigenous in Ternate were allowed to remain on condition that they become royal subjects.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 92.</ref> The current captain Nuno Pereira de Lacerda accepted the conditions. This was the first major victory scored by people in what is now Indonesia over a Western power. It has been described as a very important event since it delayed Western colonization in the East Indian archipelago for a hundred years.\n\nThus, on 15 July 1575, the Portuguese left Ternate in disgrace; however, Babullah stood by his word and no-one was hurt. The importance of Melaka for the spice trade caused a degree of moderation. He made it clear that the Portuguese merchants could still arrive freely and that the prices in cloves remained as they had been. A Portuguese relief armada took the Portuguese on board and sailed over to Ambon where they strengthened the local garrison at what is today [[Ambon City]].<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:6, p. 455-6.</ref> Some ended up in [[Malacca]] while others proceeded to [[Solor]] and [[Timor]] where they engaged in the lucrative sandalwood trade and remained for the next 400 years.<ref>Arend van Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout: De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers.</ref>\n\n== Visit of Francis Drake ==\nOn 3 November 1579, Sultan Babullah received a visit of [[Francis Drake]], the well-known English seafarer and adventurer. Drake and his crew, achieving the second [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, came across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] with five ships, one of which was the legendary ''[[Golden Hind]]''. The Englishman described Babullah as a man of \"a tall stature, very corpulent and well set together, of a very princely and gratious countenance\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 98.</ref> In his dealings with Babullah, Drake was baffled since the Sultan did not seem interested in a joint campaign against the Iberians. Drake expressed his displeasure with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain]] and described the current situation in [[Europe]]. Babullah received his guests with joy and entertained them in the palace. The ruler declared his eternal friendship with Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], apparently with the aim to play out the English against the Portuguese.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 95-6.</ref> In a sense their meeting was an embryo of diplomatic relations between [[Indonesia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn a sumptuous banquet that took place after the negotiations, Drake and entourage were served dishes from sago, rice, various side dishes from goats, deer and chickens to roasted pork and canary (crab), all of which were cooked with clove herbs.\nBetween the Sultan and Francis Drake arose mutual respect. Francis Drake was impressed with Babullah. He left Ternate with a small quantity of prime quality clover, the sultan alongside the Ternate fleet accompanying the Drake ship to the high seas.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 102.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Drake's report ===\nSultan Babullah welcomed his guests with grand ceremonies at a special occasion. Francis Drake's report describes the atmosphere of the meeting;\n\n: '' \"While our people were waiting for the Sultan to come in about half an hour, they had a better chance to observe these things; also, before the arrival of the Sultan, there were three rows of old noble figures, who allegedly all were personal advisers to the king; at the end of the house was placed a group of young people, dressed and looking elegant. Outside the house, on the right, stood four men with gray hair, all dressed in long red robes to the ground, but the head coverings were not much different from the Turks; they were called Romans / Europeans, or foreigners, who were there as intermediaries to keep trade with this nation; there were also two Turks, one Italian as an intermediary, and lastly a Spaniard, freed from Portuguese hands by the Sultan when the island was recovered, who quit as a soldier to serve the Sultan. ''\n\n: '' The King finally came from the castle, with 8 or 10 senators following him, shaded with a very luxurious canopy (with gold ornaments embossed in the center), and guarded by 12 spears whose points were turned downwards; our people (accompanied by Moro, the sultan's brother), got up to meet him, and he very kindly welcomed and exchanged pleasantries with them. As we have described earlier, he spoke softly, with temperate speech, with the elegance of the attitude of a Sultan, and a Moor by nation. His clothes were in the fashion of other inhabitants of his country, but much more luxurious, as demanded by his existence and status; from the waist to the ground he wore very rich gold-embroidered cloth. His legs were bare, but on his feet were a pair of red velvet shoes; his headdresses encrusted with gold-plated rings, one or one and a half inches wide, which made them beautiful and princely, like a crown; on his neck he wore a chain of pure gold with very large links and one fold double; on his left hand was a diamond, an emerald, ruby and turquoise stones, 4 very beautiful and perfect gemstones; on his right hand, in a ring, was a big, perfect turquoise stone, and in the other ring were many smaller diamonds, which were very artistically set together. ''\n\n: '' Thus he sat on the throne of his kingdom, and on the right stood a servant with a very expensive fan (richly embroidered and decorated with sapphires). He fanned and gathered the air to cool the sultan, for his place was very hot, both because of the sun and the gathering of so many people. After some time, after the gentlemen had conveyed their message, and received an answer, they were allowed to leave, and were safely brought back by one of the chiefs of the Sultan's Council, which the Sultan himself commissioned to do\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 100-1. Slightly modernized text.</ref>\n\n== Sultan Babullah and the golden age of Ternate ==\nWith the departure of the Portuguese, Sultan Babullah converted S\u00e3o Paulo into his own fortress which also served as a palace. He renovated and fortified the stronghold and changed its name to Gamalama fortress. Under the aegis of Babullah the trading fleets from Melaka continued to arrive at Ternate from year to year, so that the flow of commerce with the European and wider world continued. No more granting of privileges were issued, thus Western merchants were treated similar to traders from other countries and they were kept under strict surveillance. Sultan Babullah even issued a regulation requiring every European arriving in Ternate to remove his hats and shoes, just to remind them not to forget themselves.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 94.</ref>\n\nSultan Babullah maintained or created a network of alliances with other rulers and places in the Indonesian Archipelago. The Javanese Muslims from the port kingdoms of the Pesisir (north coast) became the steady allies of Ternate.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1980) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. II. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 12.</ref> Frequent visits were undertaken to the areas claimed by Ternate, where their loyalty to the Sultan's policy was requested. In 1580 Babullah is said to have led a grand naval expedition (''hongi'') that visited a number of places in Sulawesi. The ruler also paid a visit to [[Makassar]] and met with the king of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]], Tunijallo. The two rulers concluded an alliance, whereby Babullah invited Tunijallo to convert to Islam. The king politely declined to become a Muslim, but as a sign of the new bond Sultan Babullah built a fortress at the Gowan coast called [[Fort Somba Opu|Somba Opu]]. His fleet then proceeded to conquer the island of [[Selayar Island|Selayar]] south of Sulawesi.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 107-8.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref>\n\nUnder the leadership of Babullah, the Sultanate of Ternate reached its height of its glory. Early in his reign, the Sultan dispatched fleets to subjugate Buru, Ceram, parts of Ambon, and in 1580 the chiefdoms in North Sulawesi, [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]] (both in eastern Sulawesi), Tiworo (south-eastern Sulawesi) and [[Buton]] fell under his sway. Ternatan influence was also felt in the [[Solor Islands]] close to Timor, with access to the Timorese sandalwood,<ref>Arend de Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout; De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers, p. 72.</ref> and on the nutmeg-producing [[Banda Islands]].<ref>Peter Lape ''Contact and conflict in the Banda Islands, Eastern Indonesia, 11th-17th centuries''. PhD thesis, Brown University, p. 64.</ref> A list of dependencies drawn up by the Spaniards in c. 1590 furthermore mentions [[Mindanao]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands|Papuan Islands]] and the [[Sumbawa|Sumbawan]] kingdoms [[Bima]] and Kore, though these places were probably only very loosely attached.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> While the outlying areas were merely tributaries, other regions were placed under deputy rulers appointed by the sultan, called ''Sangaji'' (honoured prince). Babullah was nicknamed ''ruler of 72 islands'', as related by the Dutch historian and geographer [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] (1724).<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 108.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref> At this stage the Ternate sultanate was the largest Islamic kingdom in eastern Indonesia.\n\n==Continued struggles with the Portuguese and Spaniards==\nHis rule was far from unopposed, however. The Sultan of Tidore, Gapi Baguna, had supported Babullah after the murder of Hairun, but grew increasingly uneasy with Ternate's power ambitions. He therefore sailed over to Ambon in 1576 to draw up a strategical alliance with the Portuguese. On his way back he was trapped by a Ternate fleet and captured, though he was liberated through a daring raid by his kinsman Kaicili Salama.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974) ''Documenta Malucensia''. Rome: Jesuit Historical Society, p. 703-4.</ref> Gapi Baguna now allowed the Portuguese to build a fort on Tidore (1578), hoping to attract the clove trade and secure military backing against Ternate. After the [[Iberian Union|merger of Portugal with Spain]] in 1581, forces from the [[Spanish Philippines]] backed up the Iberian positions in Maluku. A Spanish force arrived to Tidore in 1582, and attempted to weaken Babullah through incursions on Ternate. However, the Spaniards were badly afflicted by an epidemic and had to return to [[Manila]] without achieving anything much.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 179.</ref> The full consequences of the Spanish position in the Philippines were felt by Babullah's successor Saidi Berkat in 1606.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 133, 140</ref>\n\n==Muslim diplomacy==\nThe Sultan continued his father's policy of establishing ties with faraway Muslim polities. His envoy Kaicili Naik was dispatched to [[Lisbon]] where he met [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of Spain and Portugal and demanded that Hairun's murderer should be punished (Pimentel had actually already been killed in an incident in Java). The negotiations were inconclusive; however, the main purpose of the embassy was to make alliances on the way with Islamic rulers in [[Brunei]], [[Aceh]] and [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]] ([[Banten]]?). When Kaicili Naik finally returned to Ternate after a successful mission, Babullah had already passed away.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:4, p. 199.</ref> Persons from the [[Ottoman Empire]] stayed at the court, and the Portuguese anxiously wrote about intimate contacts with Muslim figures from Aceh, the Malay World, and even [[Mecca]]. Javanese from [[Japara]] and other port kingdoms also assisted Ternate via Ambon. These far-flung contacts were signs of lively trade routes that had developed between different parts of Asia since the 15th century, which carried with them religious-cultural bonds. While the presence of Islam in Maluku had been patchy up to the mid-16th century, the age of Babullah and his successors saw a dissemination and deepening of religious observances, partly as a response to aggressive Catholic advances.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 132-7.</ref>\n\n== Ternate post Babullah ==\nSultan Babullah passed away in July 1583.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 180.</ref> The cause and place of his death are debatable. According to a late and unreliable story (by Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn, 1724), he was lured on board a Portuguese ship and treacherously taken prisoner. The Sultan was brought towards [[Goa (India)|Goa]] but passed away at sea. Other accounts allege that he was killed at home through poison or magic.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 106.</ref> Whatever the circumstances, the strong and crafty Babullah was an inspiring leader who left a void that his successors could not entirely fill. In the history of Indonesia up to the 20th century, he was the only major leader who was able to win an absolute and uncontested victory over a Western power. His success in making Ternate into an extensive realm that reached its height of success in the late 16th century is only part of the picture. He also succeeded in instilling his people's confidence and rise up against a foreign power that strove to dominate their lives.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 136-7.</ref> After the time of Sultan Babullah, no other leaders in Ternate and Maluku matched his caliber. In the face of new Spanish and Dutch advances in the early 17th century, the fabric of the Ternate polity proved too fragile to withstand colonial subordination.\n\nSultan Babullah was succeeded by his son Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (r. 1583-1606) who continued to wage war against the Portuguese and the Spanish with shifting success.\n\n== Family ==\nSultan Babullah Datu Syah had the following known wives or co-wives:\n* A sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore\n* Bega, from the [[Sula Islands]], mother of Saidi\n\nHis known children were:\n* Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (c. 1563-1628), ruler of Ternate 1583-1606\n* Boki Ainalyakin, married Kodrat, Sultan of Jailolo\n* Boki Randangagalo, married to a Sultan of Tidore, later with a Sultan of Bacan\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n* [[Estado da India]]\n\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = [[Hairun]]\n| title = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n| years = 1570-1583\n| after = [[Saidi Berkat]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* M.

Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 117.</ref> The Ternatan elite at first cooperated with the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] foreigners whose superior weaponry and possession of the trading entrepot of [[Melaka]] made then useful allies. However, the behavior of the Portuguese commanders and soldiery soon evoked resentment. Sultan Hairun lived in an uneasy relationship with the Portuguese captains who nevertheless assisted him in defeating the other sultantes in [[North Maluku]], [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] and [[Jailolo]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 122; P.A. Tiele IV:1, p. 399-400.</ref> A Ternatan-Portuguese conflict broke out in the 1560s, since Muslims in [[Ambon]] appealed for assistance from the sultan against the Europeans, who at this time were bent on Christianizing the island. Sultan Hairun sent a war fleet under Prince Baab who appeared before the Christian village Nusaniwi in 1563 and demanded its surrender. However, the siege had to be lifted as three Portuguese ships appeared.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:1, p. 405.</ref> For a time after 1564, the Portuguese were forced to leave Ambon altogether, although they came back and established a stronghold in 1569.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974), p. 12.</ref> Moreover, Baab undertook an expedition to the northern parts of Sulawesi in 1563 in order to bring these lands under his father's realm. The Portuguese authorities in Maluku understood that this would be paired with the dissemination of Islam and therefore detrimental to their position in the East Indies, and efforts were made to convert populations in [[Menado]], [[Siau Island]], Kaidipang, Toli-Toli, etc. to Christianity.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:3, p. 418-20, IV:5, p. 440.</ref>\n\nIn spite of all these conflicts, the Ternate-Portuguese relationship was not entirely broken. The officer Gonsalo Pereira led an expedition to the [[Philippines]] in 1569, where the rulers of Tidore, Bacan and Ternate were summoned to participate. Prince Baab showed up with fifteen ''korakoras'' (large outriggers). However, since Ternate had little interest in this venture, Baab diverted on the way and brought his fleet to the [[Melaka Straits]] where he performed acts of piracy. He nevertheless lost 300 men in the enterprise. The Portuguese enterprise in the Philippines likewise turned out to be a failure, to the ill-concealed satisfaction of Hairun.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:5, p. 438.</ref>\n\n== The death of Sultan Hairun ==\nAfter the contest for Ambon Island, Hairun strengthened his power year by year which worried the Portuguese leaders. Portuguese-influenced areas in [[Halmahera]] were attacked by his forces. Since he dominated the waterways he could stop the vital deliveries of foodstuff from Moro in Halmahera to the Portuguese settlement in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:4, p. 441-3.</ref> In 1570 Captain Diogo Lopes de Mesquita (1566-1570) undertook an official reconciliation with the sultan, but the atmosphere was still tense.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 86-7.</ref> Apparently the Portuguese peace appeal was only for gaining time to consolidate their strength, waiting for the right moment to repay Ternate.\n\nOn the pretext of discussing an urgent issue, Lopes de Mesquita invited Hairun to the fortress of S\u00e3o Paulo on 25 February 1570 for a meal. The sultan complied with the invitation and entered unattended, since his bodyguards were not allowed in. A nephew of the captain, Martim Afonso Pimentel, was posted just inside the gate. As the sultan came inside, Pimentel pierced him with his dagger and the  victim fell down dying.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 87.</ref> Mesquita assumed that by removing Hairun, Maluku would lose its only prominent leader and resistance be scattered. Here, however, he underestimated the anti-Portuguese resentment which had built up during the last decades, in particular canalized through Prince Baab.\n\n== Ascendance of Sultan Babullah ==\n=== Coronation as Sultan ===\nThe tragic death of Sultan Hairun triggered the anger of the Ternatans as well as the various kings of Maluku. The royal council, with the support of the people, brought forth Kaicili Baab as the next Sultan of Ternate, who carried the title of ''Sultan Babullah Datu Syah''. The new Sultan aimed to fight for reestablishing the banner of [[Islam]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and make [[Ternate Sultanate]] into a powerful kingdom, and to force the Portuguese out of his kingdom.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Announcement of Jihad ===\nSultan Babullah did not waste any time after his inauguration. The sacred war or [[Jihad]] was announced throughout the realm. No less than his father he emerged as a capable coordinator of different ethnic and cultural groups in the eastern archipelago. To strengthen his position, Sultan Babullah married a sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16.</ref> Some of the other Maluku Kings temporarily forgot their rivalry and united under one command under Sultan Babullah and the banner of Ternate, as did a number of kings and chiefs in the larger region. Sultan Babullah's cause was helped by a number of capable commanders, such as the King of Jailolo, the governor of [[Sula Islands|Sula]] Kapita Kapalaya, the Ambonese leader Kapita Kalakinka, and Kapitan Rubuhongi. According to Spanish sources, Sultan Babullah was able to mobilize 2,000 kora-kora and 133,300 soldiers under his banner, drawn from a vast area from [[Sulawesi]] to [[New Guinea]].<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887) \"De Europ\u00ebers in den Maleischen Archipel\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 25-35, Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> Although the numbers are debatable, they indicate the wide reach of his power and prestige.\n\n== Portuguese expulsion ==\n{{main | Portuguese-Ternate wars}}\nAfter the assassination of Hairun, Sultan Babullah demanded the handover of Lopes de Mesquita for trial. Portuguese fortresses in Ternate, namely Tolucco, Saint Lucia and Santo Pedro fell within short, leaving only the S\u00e3o Paulo Citadel as the residence of Mesquita. At the behest of Babullah the Ternate forces besieged S\u00e3o Paulo and severed its relationship with the outside world; the food supply was restricted to small rations of [[sago]], so that the inhabitants of the fort could just barely survive. The Ternatans nevertheless tolerated occasional contacts between the besieged and the islanders - it should be recalled that a lot of Ternatans had married Portuguese people and lived in the fort with their families. In their depressed state the Portuguese received Alvaro de Ataide as their new captain, replacing Lopes de Mesquita. This move did, however, alter Babullah's determination to oust the Europeans.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p.88-91. </ref>\n\nAlthough the siege of S\u00e3o Paulo was not pushed with full force, Sultan Babullah did not forget his oath. His forces attacked areas where the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] mission had made progress, and forced the baptized ruler of Bacan to revert to Islam in about 1575. He also took the war to Ambon where the Portuguese had constructed a fortress in 1569. In 1571 the 30-strong Ternate fleet, containing 3,000 troops under the leadership of Kapita Kalakinka (Kalakinda), invaded Ambon. The Ternatans managed to subjugate Hoamoal (in [[Ceram]]), [[Ambelau]], [[Manipa]], [[Kelang]] and [[Boano]]. The Portuguese troops under the captaincy of Sancho de Vasconcellos could keep their fortress with great difficulty, and lost much of their grip over the trade in cloves.<ref>Gerrit Knaap (2004) ''Kruidnagelen en Christenen: De VOC en de bevolking van Ambon 1656-1696''. Leiden: KITLV Press, p. 17-9.</ref> Vasconcellos, assisted by the Christian natives succeeded in repelling the troops of Ternate on [[Buru Island]] for a while but soon fell after Ternate renewed its assault under the leadership of Kapitan Rubuhongi.\n\nBy 1575 most the Portuguese positions in Maluku had fallen, and the indigenous tribes or kingdoms that had supported them were badly corned. There remained the S\u00e3o Paulo fortress that was still under siege. For five years the Portuguese and their families suffered a hard life in the castle, cut off from the outside world. Sultan Babullah finally gave an ultimatum to leave Ternate within 24 hours. Those who were indigenous in Ternate were allowed to remain on condition that they become royal subjects.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 92.</ref> The current captain Nuno Pereira de Lacerda accepted the conditions. This was the first major victory scored by people in what is now Indonesia over a Western power. It has been described as a very important event since it delayed Western colonization in the East Indian archipelago for a hundred years.\n\nThus, on 15 July 1575, the Portuguese left Ternate in disgrace; however, Babullah stood by his word and no-one was hurt. The importance of Melaka for the spice trade caused a degree of moderation. He made it clear that the Portuguese merchants could still arrive freely and that the prices in cloves remained as they had been. A Portuguese relief armada took the Portuguese on board and sailed over to Ambon where they strengthened the local garrison at what is today [[Ambon City]].<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:6, p. 455-6.</ref> Some ended up in [[Malacca]] while others proceeded to [[Solor]] and [[Timor]] where they engaged in the lucrative sandalwood trade and remained for the next 400 years.<ref>Arend van Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout: De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers.</ref>\n\n== Visit of Francis Drake ==\nOn 3 November 1579, Sultan Babullah received a visit of [[Francis Drake]], the well-known English seafarer and adventurer. Drake and his crew, achieving the second [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, came across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] with five ships, one of which was the legendary ''[[Golden Hind]]''. The Englishman described Babullah as a man of \"a tall stature, very corpulent and well set together, of a very princely and gratious countenance\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 98.</ref> In his dealings with Babullah, Drake was baffled since the Sultan did not seem interested in a joint campaign against the Iberians. Drake expressed his displeasure with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain]] and described the current situation in [[Europe]]. Babullah received his guests with joy and entertained them in the palace. The ruler declared his eternal friendship with Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], apparently with the aim to play out the English against the Portuguese.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 95-6.</ref> In a sense their meeting was an embryo of diplomatic relations between [[Indonesia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn a sumptuous banquet that took place after the negotiations, Drake and entourage were served dishes from sago, rice, various side dishes from goats, deer and chickens to roasted pork and canary (crab), all of which were cooked with clove herbs.\nBetween the Sultan and Francis Drake arose mutual respect. Francis Drake was impressed with Babullah. He left Ternate with a small quantity of prime quality clover, the sultan alongside the Ternate fleet accompanying the Drake ship to the high seas.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 102.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Drake's report ===\nSultan Babullah welcomed his guests with grand ceremonies at a special occasion. Francis Drake's report describes the atmosphere of the meeting;\n\n: '' \"While our people were waiting for the Sultan to come in about half an hour, they had a better chance to observe these things; also, before the arrival of the Sultan, there were three rows of old noble figures, who allegedly all were personal advisers to the king; at the end of the house was placed a group of young people, dressed and looking elegant. Outside the house, on the right, stood four men with gray hair, all dressed in long red robes to the ground, but the head coverings were not much different from the Turks; they were called Romans / Europeans, or foreigners, who were there as intermediaries to keep trade with this nation; there were also two Turks, one Italian as an intermediary, and lastly a Spaniard, freed from Portuguese hands by the Sultan when the island was recovered, who quit as a soldier to serve the Sultan. ''\n\n: '' The King finally came from the castle, with 8 or 10 senators following him, shaded with a very luxurious canopy (with gold ornaments embossed in the center), and guarded by 12 spears whose points were turned downwards; our people (accompanied by Moro, the sultan's brother), got up to meet him, and he very kindly welcomed and exchanged pleasantries with them. As we have described earlier, he spoke softly, with temperate speech, with the elegance of the attitude of a Sultan, and a Moor by nation. His clothes were in the fashion of other inhabitants of his country, but much more luxurious, as demanded by his existence and status; from the waist to the ground he wore very rich gold-embroidered cloth. His legs were bare, but on his feet were a pair of red velvet shoes; his headdresses encrusted with gold-plated rings, one or one and a half inches wide, which made them beautiful and princely, like a crown; on his neck he wore a chain of pure gold with very large links and one fold double; on his left hand was a diamond, an emerald, ruby and turquoise stones, 4 very beautiful and perfect gemstones; on his right hand, in a ring, was a big, perfect turquoise stone, and in the other ring were many smaller diamonds, which were very artistically set together. ''\n\n: '' Thus he sat on the throne of his kingdom, and on the right stood a servant with a very expensive fan (richly embroidered and decorated with sapphires). He fanned and gathered the air to cool the sultan, for his place was very hot, both because of the sun and the gathering of so many people. After some time, after the gentlemen had conveyed their message, and received an answer, they were allowed to leave, and were safely brought back by one of the chiefs of the Sultan's Council, which the Sultan himself commissioned to do\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 100-1. Slightly modernized text.</ref>\n\n== Sultan Babullah and the golden age of Ternate ==\nWith the departure of the Portuguese, Sultan Babullah converted S\u00e3o Paulo into his own fortress which also served as a palace. He renovated and fortified the stronghold and changed its name to Gamalama fortress. Under the aegis of Babullah the trading fleets from Melaka continued to arrive at Ternate from year to year, so that the flow of commerce with the European and wider world continued. No more granting of privileges were issued, thus Western merchants were treated similar to traders from other countries and they were kept under strict surveillance. Sultan Babullah even issued a regulation requiring every European arriving in Ternate to remove his hats and shoes, just to remind them not to forget themselves.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 94.</ref>\n\nSultan Babullah maintained or created a network of alliances with other rulers and places in the Indonesian Archipelago. The Javanese Muslims from the port kingdoms of the Pesisir (north coast) became the steady allies of Ternate.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1980) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. II. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 12.</ref> Frequent visits were undertaken to the areas claimed by Ternate, where their loyalty to the Sultan's policy was requested. In 1580 Babullah is said to have led a grand naval expedition (''hongi'') that visited a number of places in Sulawesi. The ruler also paid a visit to [[Makassar]] and met with the king of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]], Tunijallo. The two rulers concluded an alliance, whereby Babullah invited Tunijallo to convert to Islam. The king politely declined to become a Muslim, but as a sign of the new bond Sultan Babullah built a fortress at the Gowan coast called [[Fort Somba Opu|Somba Opu]]. His fleet then proceeded to conquer the island of [[Selayar]] south of Sulawesi.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 107-8.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref>\n\nUnder the leadership of Babullah, the Sultanate of Ternate reached its height of its glory. Early in his reign, the Sultan dispatched fleets to subjugate Buru, Ceram, parts of Ambon, and in 1580 the chiefdoms in North Sulawesi, [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]] (both in eastern Sulawesi), Tiworo (south-eastern Sulawesi) and [[Buton]] fell under his sway. Ternatan influence was also felt in the [[Solor Islands]] close to Timor, with access to the Timorese sandalwood,<ref>Arend de Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout; De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers, p. 72.</ref> and on the nutmeg-producing [[Banda Islands]].<ref>Peter Lape ''Contact and conflict in the Banda Islands, Eastern Indonesia, 11th-17th centuries''. PhD thesis, Brown University, p. 64.</ref> A list of dependencies drawn up by the Spaniards in c. 1590 furthermore mentions [[Mindanao]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands|Papuan Islands]] and the [[Sumbawa|Sumbawan]] kingdoms [[Bima]] and Kore, though these places were probably only very loosely attached.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> While the outlying areas were merely tributaries, other regions were placed under deputy rulers appointed by the sultan, called ''Sangaji'' (honoured prince). Babullah was nicknamed ''ruler of 72 islands'', as related by the Dutch historian and geographer [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] (1724).<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 108.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref> At this stage the Ternate sultanate was the largest Islamic kingdom in eastern Indonesia.\n\n==Continued struggles with the Portuguese and Spaniards==\nHis rule was far from unopposed, however. The Sultan of Tidore, Gapi Baguna, had supported Babullah after the murder of Hairun, but grew increasingly uneasy with Ternate's power ambitions. He therefore sailed over to Ambon in 1576 to draw up a strategical alliance with the Portuguese. On his way back he was trapped by a Ternate fleet and captured, though he was liberated through a daring raid by his kinsman Kaicili Salama.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974) ''Documenta Malucensia''. Rome: Jesuit Historical Society, p. 703-4.</ref> Gapi Baguna now allowed the Portuguese to build a fort on Tidore (1578), hoping to attract the clove trade and secure military backing against Ternate. After the [[Iberian Union|merger of Portugal with Spain]] in 1581, forces from the [[Spanish Philippines]] backed up the Iberian positions in Maluku. A Spanish force arrived to Tidore in 1582, and attempted to weaken Babullah through incursions on Ternate. However, the Spaniards were badly afflicted by an epidemic and had to return to [[Manila]] without achieving anything much.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 179.</ref> The full consequences of the Spanish position in the Philippines were felt by Babullah's successor Saidi Berkat in 1606.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 133, 140</ref>\n\n==Muslim diplomacy==\nThe Sultan continued his father's policy of establishing ties with faraway Muslim polities. His envoy Kaicili Naik was dispatched to [[Lisbon]] where he met [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of Spain and Portugal and demanded that Hairun's murderer should be punished (Pimentel had actually already been killed in an incident in Java). The negotiations were inconclusive; however, the main purpose of the embassy was to make alliances on the way with Islamic rulers in [[Brunei]], [[Aceh]] and [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]] ([[Banten]]?). When Kaicili Naik finally returned to Ternate after a successful mission, Babullah had already passed away.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:4, p. 199.</ref> Persons from the [[Ottoman Empire]] stayed at the court, and the Portuguese anxiously wrote about intimate contacts with Muslim figures from Aceh, the Malay World, and even [[Mecca]]. Javanese from [[Japara]] and other port kingdoms also assisted Ternate via Ambon. These far-flung contacts were signs of lively trade routes that had developed between different parts of Asia since the 15th century, which carried with them religious-cultural bonds. While the presence of Islam in Maluku had been patchy up to the mid-16th century, the age of Babullah and his successors saw a dissemination and deepening of religious observances, partly as a response to aggressive Catholic advances.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 132-7.</ref>\n\n== Ternate post Babullah ==\nSultan Babullah passed away in July 1583.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 180.</ref> The cause and place of his death are debatable. According to a late and unreliable story (by Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn, 1724), he was lured on board a Portuguese ship and treacherously taken prisoner. The Sultan was brought towards [[Goa (India)|Goa]] but passed away at sea. Other accounts allege that he was killed at home through poison or magic.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 106.</ref> Whatever the circumstances, the strong and crafty Babullah was an inspiring leader who left a void that his successors could not entirely fill. In the history of Indonesia up to the 20th century, he was the only major leader who was able to win an absolute and uncontested victory over a Western power. His success in making Ternate into an extensive realm that reached its height of success in the late 16th century is only part of the picture. He also succeeded in instilling his people's confidence and rise up against a foreign power that strove to dominate their lives.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 136-7.</ref> After the time of Sultan Babullah, no other leaders in Ternate and Maluku matched his caliber. In the face of new Spanish and Dutch advances in the early 17th century, the fabric of the Ternate polity proved too fragile to withstand colonial subordination.\n\nSultan Babullah was succeeded by his son Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (r. 1583-1606) who continued to wage war against the Portuguese and the Spanish with shifting success.\n\n== Family ==\nSultan Babullah Datu Syah had the following known wives or co-wives:\n* A sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore\n* Bega, from the [[Sula Islands]], mother of Saidi\n\nHis known children were:\n* Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (c. 1563-1628), ruler of Ternate 1583-1606\n* Boki Ainalyakin, married Kodrat, Sultan of Jailolo\n* Boki Randangagalo, married to a Sultan of Tidore, later with a Sultan of Bacan\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n* [[Estado da India]]\n\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = [[Hairun]]\n| title = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n| years = 1570-1583\n| after = [[Saidi Berkat]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* M.
