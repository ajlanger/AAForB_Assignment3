Of the 44 people on board, only the pilot survived. \n\nThe Peruvian Naval Aviation Commission investigated the accident and created a report but never officially disclosed its content. Eventually, the Navy's accident report was discovered and details of it were released. In the report, investigators cited pilot error as the primary cause of the accident. \n\n==Accident==\nAlianza was scheduled to play a football match against Deportivo Pucallpa and had organized a charter aircraft, provided by the Air Services branch of the [[Peruvian Navy]] for the trip to Pucallpa and back. After the game the aircraft departed Pucallpa at 6:30 p.m. with Peruvian Navy Lieutenant Edilberto Villar as the [[pilot in command]], C\u00e9sar Morales as copilot, four cabin crewmembers and 38 players, staff and team supporters.<ref name=\"avi\"/>\n\nThe flight was uneventful until the crew began their descent into Lima. Upon lowering the landing gear, the left and right main gear displayed green lights, indicating down and locked, but the nose gear did not. Villar requested that Morales consult the flight manual for the proper procedure to follow. The manual was written in English and because Morales's foreign language skill was poor he read out the wrong procedure. The crew requested a fly-by of the control tower so that observers could confirm that the nose gear was down. Using binoculars the observers confirmed that the airplane was configured for landing and the crew brought the aircraft around for another attempt at a landing. While over water the aircraft flew too low and the right wing struck the surface of the ocean as the aircraft was lining up with the runway, {{convert|6.9|mi|disp=flip|abbr=on}} northwest of the airport.
