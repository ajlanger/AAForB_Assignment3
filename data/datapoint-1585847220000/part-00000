MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as John Lennon\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.

Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent.
