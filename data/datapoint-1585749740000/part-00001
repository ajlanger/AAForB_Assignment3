He lived there with his parents, Ernest and Marie, and his brother Philippe and then at [[Boisguillaume]] in a two-storey house, \"one of those houses with exposed beams that tourists think are pretty but those who live there find uncomfortable.\"<ref name=anquetil>Anquetil, Jacques (1966): ''En br\u00fblant les \u00e9tapes'', Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n\nIn 1941, his father refused contracts to work on military installations for the German occupiers and his work dried up. Other members of the family worked in strawberry farming and Anquetil's father followed them, moving to the hamlet of Bourguet, near [[Quincampoix]]. Anquetil had his first bicycle \u2013 an [[Alcyon]] \u2013 at the age of four and twice a day rode the kilometre and a half to the village and back. There he was taught by a teacher wearing clogs in a classroom heated by a smoking stove.<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil learned metal-turning at the technical college at [[Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen]], a suburb of the city, where he played [[billiards]] with a friend named Maurice Dieulois. His friend joined the AC Sottevillais club with the encouragement of his father and began racing. Anquetil said: {{cquote|...[I] was impressed by the way girls were attracted to Dieulois because he had become a ''coureur cycliste'' ... so I gave up my first choice \u2013 running \u2013 and joined the club as well.\"<ref name=\"anquetil\" />}}\nHe was 17 and he took out his first racing licence on 2 December 1950. He stayed a member the rest of his life<ref name=\"velo\">L'Auto Cycle Sottevillais, ''V\u00e9lo'', France, November 2007</ref> and his grave in the churchyard at Quincampoix has a permanent tribute from his clubmates.\n\nAnquetil passed his qualifications in light engineering and went to work for 50 old francs a day at a factory in Sotteville. He left after 26 days following a disagreement with his boss over time off for training. The AC Sottevillais, founded in 1898, was run by a cycle-dealer, [[Andr\u00e9 Boucher]], who had a shop in the Place du Trianon in Sotteville.<ref name=\"velo\" /> The club had not just Anquetil but [[Claude LeBer]], who became professional pursuit champion in 1955, Jean Jourden, world amateur champion in 1961, and Francis Bazire, who came second in the world amateur championship in 1963.\n\nBoucher trained his group first from a bicycle and then by [[Derny]]. Anquetil made fast progress and won 16 times as an amateur. His first victory was the Prix Maurice Latour at [[Rouen]] on 3 May 1951. He also took the Prix de France in 1952 and the Tour de la Manche and the national road championship the same year.\n\n== The Grand Prix des Nations ==\nAnquetil rode in the French team in the 100&nbsp;km [[time trial]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] and won a bronze medal.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |title=Jacques Anquetil Olympic Results |accessdate=28 December 2012 |work=sports-reference.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214112523/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 }}</ref> Impressed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's progress, Andr\u00e9 Boucher sent an envelope of Anquetil's press cuttings to the local representative of the Perle bicycle company and asked him to send them to the firm's cycling team manager, the former [[Tour de France]] rider, [[Francis P\u00e9lissier]].<ref name=wood>Woodland, Les (2007) ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', UK. {{ISBN|0224063189}}</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier called Anquetil, who was surprised and flattered to hear from him, and offered him 30,000 old francs a month to ride for La Perle as an independent, or semi-professional. Anquetil accepted and immediately ordered a new car, a [[Renault Fregate]], which he crashed twice in the first 12 months.<ref name=\"yates\">Yates, Richard (January 1997), ''Ma\u00eetre Jacques'', Cycle News, UK</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier wanted Anquetil for the 1953 [[Grand Prix des Nations]], a race started by the newspaper ''Paris-Soir'' which since 1932 had risen to the status of an unofficial world time-trial championship. It was held on a 142&nbsp;km loop of rolling roads through [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], [[Rambouillet]], [[Maulette]], [[St-R\u00e9my-les-Chevreuse]] and then back to Versailles before, originally, finishing on the Buffalo track in Paris.\n\nAnquetil was aware that one of his rivals was an Englishman named Ken Joy, who had broken records in Britain but was unknown in France. He would ride with another Englishman, Bob Maitland.<ref name=\"yates\" /> The historian Richard Yates says:\n\n<blockquote>Many of the 'against-the-clock' fraternity in the United Kingdom sincerely believed that the British time triallists were as good as, if not better than, their Continental counterparts and here was the chance to prove it. When the final result was known the British fans were disappointed and saw the race as a total failure for Britain as both Englishman had finished nearly 20 minutes down. To rub salt in the wounds, the event had been won by an unknown, curly-haired teenager from Normandy.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil caught Joy \u2014 the moment he realised he was going to win the race<ref name=anquetil /> \u2014 even though Joy had started 16 minutes earlier. At 19, Anquetil had become unofficial time-trial champion of the world.\n\nThe win pleased P\u00e9lissier but did not convince him. Next year he drove his team car not behind Anquetil but his Swiss star, [[Hugo Koblet]]. Anquetil was not amused. When he beat Koblet, he sent his winner's bouquet to P\u00e9lissier's wife \"in deepest sympathy\".<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil rode the Grand Prix des Nations nine times without being beaten.\n\n== Hour record ==\n[[File:Anquetil memorial at Quincampoix 03.jpg|thumb|200px|Anquetil memorial at [[Quincampoix]]]]\nOn 22 September 1954, Anquetil started two years' compulsory service in the army, joining the Richepanse de Rouen barracks as a gunner of the 406th artillery regiment. The army accorded him few great favours but there was an exception:\n\n{{cquote|In June 1956, my chiefs finally gave me an order more to my liking, the strangest, the most unusual that a gunner has ever been asked to carry out; it was nothing less than to beat the world [[hour record]]. I knew what that meant: to storm a veritable fortress. For 14 years, since 7 November 1942, the date on which Fausto Coppi planted the Italian flag on it, it had discouraged all assailants. One figure sums up the difficulty of the enterprise: 45.848&nbsp;km.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nShould he break the record, he and the army agreed, he would give half the rewards to the army and the rest to the mother of a soldier, Andr\u00e9 Dufour, who had been killed while fighting at Palestro, in [[Algeria]].<ref name=Chany>Chany, Pierre (1988), ''La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme'', Nathan, France. {{ISBN|2092864319}}</ref> The chances of breaking it were far from guaranteed, not only because Coppi's record had already defied [[Gerrit Schulte]] and [[Louison Bobet]] but also Anquetil himself, on 23 November 1955, when he had started too fast, faded and finished 696&nbsp;m short of Coppi. His second attempt also flopped. He again started too fast. After 54:36 his helpers called him to a stop after 41.326&nbsp;km. His legs failed him when he got off his bike and he had to be carried to a chair in a corner of the [[Velodromo Vigorelli]], the [[velodrome]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The Italian crowd chanted: \"Coppi! Coppi! Coppi!\"<ref name=anquetil /><ref name=anquetil /><ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\n{{cquote|I was like a child's lead soldier that has lost its horse.\"<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nNext day he received a telegram: \"Congratulations on a good performance. Sure of your success. Take your time. Captain Gueguen will arrive tomorrow with instructions. Signed: Commander Dieudonn\u00e9\".<ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\nAt 7:30pm on 29 June 1956, riding a lighter bike made in three days to the same design as Coppi's, and using a 7m40 gear (52x15), Anquetil tried again and finally broke his hero's record, riding 46.159&nbsp;km. Coppi was the first professional to give Anquetil his autograph.<ref>Interview, Magazine 24, ORTF (television), France, 20 November 1963</ref> When the two next met, Anquetil was also a professional. He went to Italy to meet Coppi and, for reasons never explained, dressed as a simple country boy rather than in the smart clothes that he normally wore.\n\n{{cquote|The grandstands fell quiet. They were preparing to take Coppi to the cemetery. I liked that silence. On the 84th lap, Boucher gave me my release. \"''Allez, m\u00f4me, tout''!\" [\"Go, kid, give it everything!\"] Until then I had been well within myself [''J'ai fum\u00e9 ma pipe'']... On a big school blackboard, Captain Gueguen wrote 46.159km. I could lift my arms, sit up and breathe a bit of fresh air. Ah, the public! Those who were whistling me four laps earlier kissed my bike, my jersey, reaching out to touch me in the way they do during processions of holy relics.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nIn 1967, 11 years later, Anquetil again broke the hour record, with 47.493&nbsp;km, but the record was disallowed because he refused to take the newly introduced post-race doping test.<ref name=Cycling /> He objected to what he saw as the indignity of having to urinate in a tent in a crowded velodrome and said he would take the test at his hotel. The international judge ruled against the idea and a scuffle ensued that involved Anquetil's manager, [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]]. ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' reported:<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\" />\n\n<blockquote>Wonderful Jacques Anquetil has broken the world hour record as he said he would... and then ran into official trouble when he refused to take a trackside dope test demanded by the Italian authorities. An Italian Dr Giuliano Marena asked for the urine sample, but Anquetil refused and asked him to come to his hotel. Dr Marena refused and, after waiting a couple of hours at the track, left town to go home to Florence. Anquetil said at his hotel: 'I didn't and don't intend to escape the test, but it must take place under circumstances far different from those at the velodrome. I'm still here and ready to undergo the test.' While Italian officials talked of taking the matter to the UCI, Dr Tanguy of the FFC [French cycling federation] took a sample from Anquetil on his return to Rouen, pointing out afterwards that it would be valid up to 48 hours after the record attempt. But Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, his manager, had all but lost his temper with the Italian medical man and had tried to throw him out of the cabin, though Jacques had remonstrated mildly. Later he said that he understood the tests would be valid for up to 48 hours and said he was trying to locate another doctor for the test.<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\">Cycling, 7 October 1967, p. 4</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Tour de France ==\n[[File:Jacques Anquetil 1963.jpg|thumb|Anquetil at the [[1963 Tour de France]]]]\n[[File:Anquetil Poulidor Bahamontes 1964.jpg|thumb|Anquetil (center) at the [[1964 Tour de France]]]]\nIn 1957 Anquetil rode \u2013 and won \u2013 his first [[1957 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. His inclusion in the national team \u2013 the Tour was still ridden by national rather than commercial teams \u2013 was what the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier called \"a forceps operation\".<ref name=Ollivier>Ollivier, Jean-Paul (1999): ''Maillot Jaune'', Reader's Digest Selection, France</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[[Louison Bobet]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] wished to rule the Tour de France and had no desire to have Anquetil. But Louison, worn out from his battle of nerves that he suffered in the Tour of Italy, where he used all his energy in defending the ''maglia rosa'' [leader's jersey] against Italian hatred [''d\u00e9ferlante''], declared, on the banks of the Adriatic; \"I am not prepared, mentally, to take part in the Tour de France. I am 32 in a world of youth.\"<ref name=Ollivier /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil recognised the allusion and accepted the invitation to ride. He finished nearly 15 minutes ahead of the rest, winning four stages and the team stage.\n\nIn 1959, Anquetil was whistled as he finished the Tour on the [[Parc des Princes]] because spectators calculated that he and others had contrived to let [[Federico Bahamontes]] win rather than the Frenchman [[Henry Anglade]]. The French team was unbalanced by internal rivalries. Anglade, whose bossy nature earned him the nickname [[Napoleon]], was unusual in that he was represented by the agent Roger Piel while the others had Daniel Dousset. The two men controlled French racing.<ref>''Dousset-Piel, l'Age de Bronze'', V\u00e9lo, France November 2005</ref> Dousset worked out that his riders had to beat Bahamontes or make sure that Anglade didn't win. Since they couldn't beat Anglade, they let Bahamontes win because Bahamontes, a poor rider on the flat and on small circuits, would be no threat to the post-Tour criterium fees that made up the bulk of riders' \u2014 and agents' \u2014 earnings.\n\nAnquetil was jeered and showed his coldness to public reaction by buying a boat that he named \"The Whistles of 59\" and by pointing out that he was a professional and that his first interest was money. It was an attitude that other riders understood but made him hard for fans to love .\n\nIn 1960 Anquetil stayed away from the Tour, returning in [[1961 Tour de France|1961]] and winning it thereafter until [[1964 Tour de France|1964]]. He won in [[1962 Tour de France|1962]] at a speed not bettered until [[1981 Tour de France|1981]]. He was the first to win four successive times, breaking the record of three set by [[Philippe Thys]] and [[Louison Bobet]]. He was first to win five times in total, since emulated by [[Eddy Merckx]], [[Bernard Hinault]] and [[Miguel Indurain]].\n\nIn 1963 Tour, at the top of a mountain, Anquetil faked a mechanical problem so that his team director could give him a bicycle more suitable for the descent. The plan worked and Anquetil overtook Bahamontes and won the stage, taking the lead.\n\nHis last Tour victory (in 1964) was his most famous, featuring an elbow-to-elbow duel with public favourite [[Raymond Poulidor]] on the road up the [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me (mountain)|Puy de D\u00f4me mountain]] on 12 July. Suffering indigestion after excesses on a rest day, Anquetil was said to have received a swallow of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] from his team manager \u2014 a story Anquetil's wife says is untrue.\n\nThe Tour organiser, [[Jacques Goddet]], was behind the pair as they turned off the main road and climbed through what the police estimated as half a million spectators. He recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The two, at the extreme of their rivalry, climbing the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman [Anquetil], used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, it was clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.<ref>Goddet, Jacques (1991): ''L'\u00c9quip\u00e9e Belle'', Robert Laffont, France</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil rode on the inside by the mountain wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's gasps on their bare arms. At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Of Anquetil, [[Pierre Chany]] wrote: <blockquote>\"His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks.\"<ref name=Chany /></blockquote> Anquetil was only semi-conscious, he said.<ref name=Chany /> Anquetil's manager, Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, said:\n\n<blockquote>Anquetil's head was a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what happened when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed on the front of my car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' I told him 14 seconds. 'That's one more than I need. I've got 13 in hand'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In my opinion Poulidor was demoralised by Anquetil's resistance, his mental strength. There were three times when he could have dropped Anquetil. First, at the bottom of the climb. Then when Julio Jimenez attacked [and left the two Frenchmen, accompanied by the rival climber Federico Bahamontes]. Finally in the last kilometre. The nearer the summit came, the more Jacques was suffering. In the last few hundred metres, he was losing time. At the top of the Puy it's 13 per cent. Poulidor should have attacked: he didn't. Poulidor didn't attack in the last 500 metres \u2013 it was Jacques who got dropped, and that's not the same thing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nPoulidor gained time but Anquetil still had a 55-second lead in Paris and won his last Tour. The writer [[Chris Sidwells]] said:\n\n<blockquote>The race also ended the Anquetil era in Tour history. He could not face riding it the following year, and in 1966 he retired from the Tour with bad health \u2013 once he'd made sure that Poulidor could not win either.<ref group=\"n\">In 1966 Anquetil prevented Poulidor from winning the Tour by putting his team-mate Lucien Aimar in a position to win.</ref> Poulidor may not have managed to slay his dragon, in fact so bloodied was he by his battle that he never did win the Tour, but he did manage to wound his rival, and in so doing brought down the curtain on the rule of the first five-times winner \u2013 the first great super-champion of the Tour de France.<ref>[[Chris Sidwells|Sidwells, Chris]] (2003) ''Golden Stages of the Tour de France'', comp: Allchin, Richard and Bell, Adrian, Mousehold Press, UK</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil was first to win all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. He twice won the [[Giro d'Italia]] ([[1960 Giro d'Italia|1960]], [[1964 Giro d'Italia|1964]]) and won the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] once ([[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]]). He also won the season-long ''[[Super Prestige Pernod International]]'' four times, in 1961, 1963, 1965 and 1966 \u2014 a record surpassed only by [[Eddy Merckx]].\n\n== Anquetil\u2013Poulidor: the social significance ==\n[[File:Poulidor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Raymond Poulidor]]]]\n\nAnquetil unfailingly beat [[Raymond Poulidor]] in the Tour and yet Poulidor remained more popular. Divisions between their fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. The extent of those divisions is shown in a story, perhaps apocryphal, told by [[Pierre Chany]], who was close to Anquetil:\n\n<blockquote>The Tour de France has the major fault of dividing the country, right down to the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.<ref name=wood /></blockquote>\n\nJean-Luc Boeuf and Yves L\u00e9onard, in their study, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who recognised themselves in Jacques Anquetil liked his priority of style and elegance in the way he rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face \u2013 lined with effort \u2013 represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich.<ref>The authors quote [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], the [[La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]], the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Paris\u2013Nice]].</ref> Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with a hard life, as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in ''Le Figaro'' when it was headlined \"This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex\".<ref>''Le Monde'', 16 April 2002, supplement page 3</ref><ref>Boeuf, Jean Luc and L\u00e9onard Yves (2003), ''La R\u00e9publique du Tour de France'', Seuil, France. {{ISBN|202058073X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Dauphin\u00e9 and Bordeaux\u2013Paris double ==\nIn 1965, Anquetil won the eight-day Alpine [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9]] Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 stage race at 3pm, sat through two hours of interviews and receptions, took a chartered flight in a French Mirage fighter plane (allegedly organised by President Charles de Gaulle, a big admirer of his) to [[Bordeaux]] at 6.30pm and won the world's longest single-day classic, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]], the following day. The race started at night and continued from after dawn behind [[derny]] motorcycle pacers.\n\nAnquetil was upset, said G\u00e9miniani, that Poulidor was always more warmly regarded even though he had never won the Tour. In 1965, when Poulidor was perceived to have received more credit for dropping Anquetil the previous year on the Puy-de-D\u00f4me than Anquetil had for winning the whole Tour, G\u00e9miniani persuaded him to ride the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and, next day, Bordeaux\u2013Paris. That, he said, would end any argument over who was the greater.\n\nAnquetil won the Dauphin\u00e9, despite bad weather which he disliked, at 3pm. After two hours of interviews and receptions he flew from N\u00eemes to Bordeaux. At midnight, he ate his pre-race meal and went to the start in the city's northern suburbs.\n\nHe could eat little during the night because of stomach cramp and was on the verge of retiring. G\u00e9miniani swore and called him \"a great poof\" to offend his pride and keep him riding.<ref>{{YouTube|Oz7kIltIpsY}}</ref> Anquetil felt better as morning came and the riders dropped in behind the [[derny]] pacing motorcycles that were a feature of the race. He responded to an attack by [[Tom Simpson]], followed by his own team-mate [[Jean Stablinski]]. Anquetil and Stablinski attacked Simpson alternately, forcing Simpson to exhaust himself, and Anquetil won at the [[Parc des Princes]]. Stablinski finished 57 seconds later just ahead of Simpson.<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm Anquetil's impossible double] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002194650/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm |date=2 October 2007 }}. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\nThe historian Dick Yates said:\n<blockquote>It had been one of the hardest and closest [[derny]]-paced races in history but much more than that this double of Anquetil was one of the greatest exploits ever seen in cycling. At the [[Parc des Princes]], Anquetil received the biggest ovation of his career, certainly much bigger than after any of his wins in the Tour. The race record was broken, Jacques was mobbed by reporters and photographers but he was tired and really had to get some rest. Few people realised it at the time but he had to make the long journey to [[Maubeuge]] in north-eastern France where the following day he was riding a [[criterium]]!<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\">Cycling News, UK, December 1997, p. 19</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere are undenied rumours that the jet laid on to get Anquetil to Bordeaux was provided through state funds on the orders of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]. G\u00e9miniani mentions the belief in his biography, without denying it, saying the truth will come out when state records are opened.\n\n== Trofeo Baracchi ==\nAnquetil's most humiliating race was the [[Trofeo Baracchi]] in Italy in 1962, when he had to be pushed by his partner, [[Rudi Altig]], and was so exhausted that he hit a pillar before reaching the track on which the race finished.\n\nThe Trofeo Baracchi was a 111&nbsp;km race for two-man teams. Anquetil, the world's best time-triallist, and Altig, a powerful rider with a strong sprint, were favourites. But things soon went wrong. The writer [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I got my stopwatch going again to check the length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check \u2014 and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport \u2014 something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front \u2014 and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe pair reached the track on which the race finished. The timekeeper was at the entrance to the stadium, so Anquetil finished. But instead of turning on to the [[velodrome]], he rode straight on and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds.\n\n== Other races ==\nAnquetil was not as successful in the classic single-day races but towards the end of his career he won:\n* [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] (1964)\n* [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] (1966)\n\nAnquetil finished in the top 10 in the [[world cycling championship|world championship]] on six occasions, but second place in 1966 was the nearest he came to the rainbow jersey.<ref name=\"sports-reference\" />\n\n== Riding style ==\nAnquetil was a smooth rider, a beautiful pedalling machine according to the American journalist Owen Mulholland:\n\n<blockquote>The sight of Jacques Anquetil on a bicycle gives credence to an idea we Americans find unpalatable, that of a natural aristocracy. From the first day he seriously straddled a top tube, \"Anq\" had a sense or perfection most riders spend a lifetime searching for. Between 1950, when he rode his first race, and nineteen years later, when he retired, Anquetil had countless frames underneath him, yet that indefinable poise was always there.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The look was that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were extended more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes pointed down. Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques was the first of the big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on his thin [[Mafac]] brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|title=Bikerace Info, Rider database, Jacques Anquetil|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821072612/http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Physical attributes ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Height:\n| 1.76 m\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Weight:\n| {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref>These and other details published 1966 in ''En Br\u00fblant les \u00c9tapes'', Jacques Anquetil, published Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Chest:\n| 95&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Arm circumference:\n| 27&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Calf circumference:\n| 32&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Thigh circumference:\n| 47&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Foot size:\n| 41\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Lung capacity:\n| 6 litres\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Normal heart rate:\n| 48\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Heart rate after exercise:\n| 90\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Training:\n| 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, three times a week\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Gym training:\n| 20 minutes, twice a week\n|-\n!! style=\"text-align:right\"|Diet:\n| No restrictions other than sauces.

Dick Yates wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Rapha\u00ebl embarked on a policy of trying to convince Jacques of the need to win more races as he certainly had the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but G\u00e9miniani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how a man of his talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\" /></blockquote>\n\nAs a partnership they won four Tours de France, two Giro d'Italia, the [[Dauphin\u00e9-Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] and then next day, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]]. G\u00e9miniani said of him:\n<blockquote>Today, everybody pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I can still hear the way he was whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial<ref group=\"n\">Anquetil was the dominant time-triallist of his period</ref> to make him lose. His home town of [[Rouen]] organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in [[Antwerp]] that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a [[Amateur|dilettante]]. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (''il les a tous couillonn\u00e9s'').<ref>L'Express 19 June 2003</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Honours ==\nAnquetil was named France's champion of champions by [[L'\u00c9quipe]] in 1963. He was appointed Chevalier de l'[[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]] in 1965 (cross of merit) and Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] on 5 October 1966.\n\n== Personal life ==\nAnquetil was fascinated by astronomy and was delighted to meet [[Yuri Gagarin]]. The rational side of his character contrasted with his superstition. In the [[1964 Tour de France]], a fortune-teller called Belline predicted in [[France-Soir]] that Anquetil would die on or around the 13th day of the race. His wife Janine, knowing Anquetil's superstition, hid the paper but Anquetil found out, not least because he was sent cuttings with unsigned letters.<ref name=letour>Le Tour de France, Jean-Paul Brouchon, Balland-Jacob-Duvernet, 2000</ref>\n\nJean-Paul Brouchon, leading cycling commentator at the news radio station France-Info, said of the day the forecast was supposed to come true:\n\n<blockquote>During those dark hours, Anquetil refused to leave his room [the race was having a rest day]. Finally he agreed to go for a short car ride with [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] [his team manager] and Janine, to join a party organised by Radio Andorra.<ref name=letour /></blockquote>\n\nA mixture of Anquetil's fear for the future and his enjoyment of living in the present led to newspaper pictures of the large meal and the wine that he drank that day. Next morning, still worried about the prediction and laden down by partying, he was dropped on the first hairpins of the [[Port d'Envalira]].\n\nHe was famous for preparing for races by staying up all night drinking and playing cards, although the story seems to have increased with the telling. Nevertheless, his teammate, the British rider [[Vin Denson]], has written in ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' of exuberant parties during races. Denson has written, too, of Anquetil's scrupulous business arrangements with riders and others:\n\n<blockquote>I always considered Jacques to be the very best professional\", he said. \"I admired him for the gentlemanly manner and charm with riders, the public and media. A more honest and sincere businessman and friend you would not find in any walk of life. His word was his all and was of great importance to him. He was a truly great man and champion who will be greatly missed and impossible to replace.<ref name=Cycling>''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' 26 November 1987</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe British journalist Alan Gayfer, former editor of [[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]] said:\n\n<blockquote>Jacques was a real Norman with the nuances of speech that make the Normans famous, they almost say Yes to mean No, and vice versa. I asked him when he was in London if Poulidor, who was often second to Jacques, could ever win the Tour de France: \"Yes\", he said, \"but only if I am riding, and I would always finish ahead of him.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But perhaps my finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], where a German official had been particularly rude to myself and other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike from the back of the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nDick Yates said:\n<blockquote>\"He had a deep love of the land and was at his happiest when driving a tractor. They [his wife and he] both acquired a taste for bridge parties which often continued late into the night. That Anquetil was a highly intelligent man there can be no doubt and he was the nearest thing to a true intellectual that cycling has ever produced.\"<ref>Cycling News, UK, December 1999, p20</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil married Janine Boeda on 22 December 1958. She had been married to Anquetil's doctor. The doctor, seeing a rival, sent his wife to live with friends.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\">Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Anquetil went to see her, disguised as a plumber,<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> and took her to Paris to buy clothes in the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nTheir marriage produced no children. Janine had two children, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Janine had two failed pregnancies and Anquetil grew upset in 1970 that he was not a father.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> The couple considered a surrogate mother before Janine thought of her daughter, Annie. Janine said: \"We didn't use the parental authority that we could have had over her. It was a request that I addressed to her. Gently. Annie always had the choice of refusing.\"<ref group=\"n\">''Non; nous n'avons pas abus\u00e9 de l'ascendant que nous pouvions sur elle. C'est une pri\u00e8re que je lui ai adresse\u00e9e. Gentiment.

Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Annie confirmed her mother's recollection.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> She said:\n\n{{cquote|When my mother asked that [I should become impregnated by my step-father, Anquetil].... I was totally breathtaken by the proposition.... But, mind, I accepted willingly. I have to admit that at the time, despite being 18 years old, I was in love with Jacques. And I knew that I pleased him. What do you expect? That's life. And that's how I found myself in his bed in the sacred mission of procreation.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />}}\n\nAnquetil, his wife and his wife's daughter began a ''[[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]]''<ref>Anquetil, Sophie (2004) ''Pour l'Amour de Jacques'', Grasset, France</ref> Annie said:\n{{cquote|\"Nobody thought it strange that Jacques Anquetil joined me in my bed each evening before returning to the marital bed beside my mother. Everybody was comfortable with it [''Tout le monde \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'aise''].\"<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />}}\n\nAnnie said she should have left the house after her daughter, Sophie, was born (in 2004, Sophie Anquetil published the book ''Pour l'amour de Jacques'' in which she confirmed what had been rumoured but what Anquetil had always tried to hide:<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> that she was Anquetil's daughter). Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded she leave instead.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> When Janine refused, Annie left. To fill the gap, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, ''Les Elfes'', where she organises conferences.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in [[Calenzana]], near [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\n== Doping ==\nAnquetil never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux\u2013Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through \"the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains\", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said, before adding: \"Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope.\"<ref>Cited in ''Les Miroirs du Tour'', French television, 2003</ref> There was implied acceptance of doping right to the top of the state: [[Charles de Gaulle]] said: \"Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the [[Marseillaise]] [the national anthem] abroad?\"<ref>Cited ''L'\u00c9quipe Magazine'' 23 July 1994</ref>\n\nAnquetil won [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] in 1966.  An official named Collard told him there would be a drugs test once he had got changed. \"Too late\", Anquetil said. \"If you can collect it from the soapy water there, go ahead. I'm a human being, not a fountain.\" Collard said he would return half an hour later; Anquetil said he would have left for a dinner appointment 140&nbsp;km away. Two days later the Belgian cycling federation disqualified Anquetil and fined him. Anquetil responded by calling urine tests \"a threat to individual liberty\" and engaged a lawyer. The case was never heard, the Belgians backed down and Anquetil became the winner.\n\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Jacques had the strength \u2013 for which he was always criticised \u2013 to say out loud what others would only whisper. So, when I asked him 'What have you taken?' he didn't drop his eyes before replying. He had the strength of conviction.|source=[[Pierre Chany]] on Anquetil <ref>Penot, Christophe (1996) ''Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France'', \u00c9ditions Cristel, France. {{ISBN|2-9510116-0-1}}</ref>|quoted=1}}\n\nAnquetil argued that professional riders were workers and had the same right to treat their pains, as say, a geography teacher. But the argument found less support as more riders were reported to have died or suffered health problems through drug-related incidents, including the [[death of Tom Simpson]], in the 1967 Tour de France.<ref name=Cycling />\n\nHowever, there was great support in the cyclist community for Anquetil's argument that, if there were to be rules and tests, the tests should be carried out consistently and with dignity. He said it was professional dignity, the right of a champion not to be ridiculed in front of his public, that led to his refusal to take a test in the centre of the Vigorelli track after breaking the world hour record.\n\nThe unrecognised time that Anquetil set that day was nevertheless broken by the Belgian rider [[Ferdinand Bracke]]. Anquetil was hurt that the French government had never sent him a telegram of congratulations but sent one to Bracke, who was not French. It was a measure of the unacceptability of Anquetil's arguments, as was the way he was quietly dropped from future French teams.\n\n== Anquetil and Britain ==\nBritish fans voted Anquetil the [[BBC]]'s international personality of 1964. He appeared with [[Tom Simpson]] from a studio in Paris. The Franco-American journalist [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In the studio we watched the proceedings in London, and while I cannot say Anquetil was keenly interested in the cricketing part, he was impressed with the general presentation which, however (like the stages of the 1964 Tour) he found a bit long. He was interested, though, to see [[Beryl Burton]], and his old acquaintance [[Reg Harris]] pulling at his pipe in the invited audience.<ref>''Sporting Cyclist'', UK, 1965</ref></blockquote>\n\nA few days later, Anquetil was named French sportsman of the year.\n\nAnquetil was fascinated by British enthusiasm for time-trialling and in 1961 presented prizes at the [[Road Time Trials Council]] evening at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to honour [[Beryl Burton]] and Brian Kirby.<ref name=Cycling /> The pair had won the women's and men's [[British Best All-Rounder]] competitions (BBAR) for, respectively, the highest average speed in a season over 25, 50 and 100 miles (women) and 50 and {{convert|100|mi|km}} and 12 hours (men).\n\nAlan Gayfer, the editor of ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' at the time of Anquetil's death, wrote in appreciation:\n<blockquote>It is strange to look back and see how this frail-looking young man burst on the scene in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to challenge for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160&nbsp;km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1964 Anquetil discussed riding a British 25&nbsp;mile (40&nbsp;km) race. Gayfer and Tom Simpson explained that the course would be flat and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who could predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the British record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.\n\nAnquetil asked \u00a31,000 to compete and a London timber merchant called Vic Jenner said he would put up the money. Jenner had often put money into the sport. He died shortly afterwards, however, and the ride never happened.<ref>Cited \"Cycling: the golden years\", Springfield Press, UK</ref>\n\nAnquetil took part, with Simpson, in an afternoon of exhibition racing at the Herne Hill track in South London, on 13 June 1964 \u2013 three weeks before starting in the 1964 Tour de France.\n\nAnquetil rode on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1959, 1962 and in 1965, when he won the [[Manx Trophy|Manx Premier]] by beating [[Eddy Merckx]] into second place.<ref name=Cycling />\n\n== Retirement and death ==\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teaufort 78 Anquetil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A memorial plaque to Anquetil in [[Ch\u00e2teaufort, Yvelines|Ch\u00e2teaufort]], France]]\n[[File:Anquetil's memorial at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A memorial to Anquetil in [[Quincampoix]], France]]\nAnquetil rode his last race not in France, of which he still despaired for its preferring Poulidor, but on 27 December 1969 on the track at [[Antwerp]]. It happened, wrote ''L'\u00c9quipe'' \"to the great indifference of the media.\"<ref group=\"n\">L'\u00c9quipe said Anquetil's  farewell race was in Charleroi.

The ch\u00e2teau, formerly owned by [[Guy de Maupassant]], was surrounded by 170 hectares.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nAnquetil was a correspondent for L'\u00c9quipe, consultant for [[Europe 1]] and then on Antenne 2, a race director for [[Paris\u2013Nice]] and the [[Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en]] and in Canada, [[directeur sportif]] of French teams at world championships,<ref name=Cycling /> and a member of the managing committee of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Cyclisme]]. His radio analyses were sharp and he gained notoriety in Belgium for telling [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]], the Spanish rider living in France, how to beat Eddy Merckx.\n\nHe rode his bike only three times in retirement, saying he had already ridden enough. He rode the Grand Prix des Gentlemen in [[Nice]], a race in which old riders were paired with current competitors; he went out for an afternoon with friends in Normandy; and he joined his daughter for a bike ride on her birthday. Other than that, he did not ride his bike after 1969.\n\nOn 18 November 1987, Jacques Anquetil died of [[stomach cancer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=25|title=Cycling Hall of Fame.com|website=www.cyclinghalloffame.com}}</ref> in his sleep at 6{{nbsp}}am at the St-Hilaire Clinic in [[Rouen]]. He had been there since 10 October. The clinic said: \"His state of health had visibly deteriorated over the last hours and he died in his sleep after showing great courage throughout his illness.\"<ref name=Cycling /> Anquetil is buried beside the church in Quincampoix, north of Rouen, where a large black monument by the traffic lights lists his achievements. There is a further monument at the Piste Municipale in Paris, where the centre is named after him.\n\nThe Jacques Anquetil sports stadium at Quincampoix was dedicated in 1983. There are moves to open a museum in his memory.\n\nThe historian Richard Yates wrote:\n[[File:Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix, France]]\n<blockquote>He finally came to be respected as one of the most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques was one of the most gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made G\u00e9miniani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>His inherent shyness can never fully explain his apparent cold indifference. His roots in the Normandy countryside may explain his love of the land but could not excuse his inability to even make a generous gesture. The hard life that his father had experienced could never pardon the economy of effort with which Jacques was obsessed. In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort. He spent most of the time at the back of the bunch and did not even know the name of most of the riders.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Tour visited Rouen on the 10th anniversary of Anquetil's death. There to remember his first victory in the race were his team-mates, Gilbert Bauvin, Louis Bergard, [[Albert Bouvet]], [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]], Jean Forestier, [[Andr\u00e9 Mah\u00e9]], Ren\u00e9 Privat and [[Jean Stablinski]]. There, too, was the team car from Anquetil's first Tour, driven by the man behind the wheel that year, William Odin.<ref>Cycling, \"Anquetil anniversary celebrations\", 5 July 1997</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nAnquetil made an appearance in cartoon form in the animated movie ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]] (Les Triplettes de Belleville)'' (''Belleville Rendez-vous'' in the British release).\n\nThe French film ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' may contain an indirect reference to Anquetil.  A long-lost box of souvenirs found by Am\u00e9lie reminds an ageing estranged father of the time he cheered [[Federico Bahamontes]]' win of the 1959 Tour (Anquetil, a long-time rival of Bahamontes, came third). Am\u00e9lie is later romantically pursued by Nino Quincampoix, who shares a rare surname with the village where Anquetil is buried.\n\n==Career achievements==\n===Major results===\n\nSource:<ref

and the first cyclist to win the  [[Tour de France]] five times, in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964.<ref name=\"sports-reference\" />\n\nHe stated before the 1961 Tour that he would gain the yellow jersey on day one and wear it all through the tour, a tall order with two previous winners in the field\u2014[[Charly Gaul]] and [[Federico Bahamontes]]\u2014but he did it.<ref group=\"n\">Anquetil took the yellow jersey after the second half-stage (time trial) of the first day, Darrigade having won the first half-stage.</ref> His victories in stage races such as the Tour were built on an exceptional ability to ride alone against the clock in [[individual time trial]] stages, which lent him the name '''\"Monsieur Chrono\"'''.\n\n== Early life ==\nAnquetil was the son of a builder in [[Mont-Saint-Aignan]], in the hills above [[Rouen]] in [[Normandy]], north-west France. He lived there with his parents, Ernest and Marie, and his brother Philippe and then at [[Boisguillaume]] in a two-storey house, \"one of those houses with exposed beams that tourists think are pretty but those who live there find uncomfortable.\"<ref name=anquetil>Anquetil, Jacques (1966): ''En br\u00fblant les \u00e9tapes'', Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n\nIn 1941, his father refused contracts to work on military installations for the German occupiers and his work dried up. Other members of the family worked in strawberry farming and Anquetil's father followed them, moving to the hamlet of Bourguet, near [[Quincampoix]]. Anquetil had his first bicycle \u2013 an [[Alcyon]] \u2013 at the age of four and twice a day rode the kilometre and a half to the village and back. There he was taught by a teacher wearing clogs in a classroom heated by a smoking stove.<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil learned metal-turning at the technical college at [[Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen]], a suburb of the city, where he played [[billiards]] with a friend named Maurice Dieulois. His friend joined the AC Sottevillais club with the encouragement of his father and began racing. Anquetil said: {{cquote|...[I] was impressed by the way girls were attracted to Dieulois because he had become a ''coureur cycliste'' ... so I gave up my first choice \u2013 running \u2013 and joined the club as well.\"<ref name=\"anquetil\" />}}\nHe was 17 and he took out his first racing licence on 2 December 1950. He stayed a member the rest of his life<ref name=\"velo\">L'Auto Cycle Sottevillais, ''V\u00e9lo'', France, November 2007</ref> and his grave in the churchyard at Quincampoix has a permanent tribute from his clubmates.\n\nAnquetil passed his qualifications in light engineering and went to work for 50 old francs a day at a factory in Sotteville. He left after 26 days following a disagreement with his boss over time off for training. The AC Sottevillais, founded in 1898, was run by a cycle-dealer, [[Andr\u00e9 Boucher]], who had a shop in the Place du Trianon in Sotteville.<ref name=\"velo\" /> The club had not just Anquetil but [[Claude LeBer]], who became professional pursuit champion in 1955, Jean Jourden, world amateur champion in 1961, and Francis Bazire, who came second in the world amateur championship in 1963.\n\nBoucher trained his group first from a bicycle and then by [[Derny]]. Anquetil made fast progress and won 16 times as an amateur. His first victory was the Prix Maurice Latour at [[Rouen]] on 3 May 1951. He also took the Prix de France in 1952 and the Tour de la Manche and the national road championship the same year.\n\n== The Grand Prix des Nations ==\nAnquetil rode in the French team in the 100&nbsp;km [[time trial]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] and won a bronze medal.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |title=Jacques Anquetil Olympic Results |accessdate=28 December 2012 |work=sports-reference.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214112523/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 }}</ref> Impressed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's progress, Andr\u00e9 Boucher sent an envelope of Anquetil's press cuttings to the local representative of the Perle bicycle company and asked him to send them to the firm's cycling team manager, the former [[Tour de France]] rider, [[Francis P\u00e9lissier]].<ref name=wood>Woodland, Les (2007) ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', UK. {{ISBN|0224063189}}</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier called Anquetil, who was surprised and flattered to hear from him, and offered him 30,000 old francs a month to ride for La Perle as an independent, or semi-professional. Anquetil accepted and immediately ordered a new car, a [[Renault Fregate]], which he crashed twice in the first 12 months.<ref name=\"yates\">Yates, Richard (January 1997), ''Ma\u00eetre Jacques'', Cycle News, UK</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier wanted Anquetil for the 1953 [[Grand Prix des Nations]], a race started by the newspaper ''Paris-Soir'' which since 1932 had risen to the status of an unofficial world time-trial championship. It was held on a 142&nbsp;km loop of rolling roads through [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], [[Rambouillet]], [[Maulette]], [[St-R\u00e9my-les-Chevreuse]] and then back to Versailles before, originally, finishing on the Buffalo track in Paris.\n\nAnquetil was aware that one of his rivals was an Englishman named Ken Joy, who had broken records in Britain but was unknown in France. He would ride with another Englishman, Bob Maitland.<ref name=\"yates\" /> The historian Richard Yates says:\n\n<blockquote>Many of the 'against-the-clock' fraternity in the United Kingdom sincerely believed that the British time triallists were as good as, if not better than, their Continental counterparts and here was the chance to prove it. When the final result was known the British fans were disappointed and saw the race as a total failure for Britain as both Englishman had finished nearly 20 minutes down. To rub salt in the wounds, the event had been won by an unknown, curly-haired teenager from Normandy.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil caught Joy \u2014 the moment he realised he was going to win the race<ref name=anquetil /> \u2014 even though Joy had started 16 minutes earlier. At 19, Anquetil had become unofficial time-trial champion of the world.\n\nThe win pleased P\u00e9lissier but did not convince him. Next year he drove his team car not behind Anquetil but his Swiss star, [[Hugo Koblet]]. Anquetil was not amused. When he beat Koblet, he sent his winner's bouquet to P\u00e9lissier's wife \"in deepest sympathy\".<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil rode the Grand Prix des Nations nine times without being beaten.\n\n== Hour record ==\n[[File:Anquetil memorial at Quincampoix 03.jpg|thumb|200px|Anquetil memorial at [[Quincampoix]]]]\nOn 22 September 1954, Anquetil started two years' compulsory service in the army, joining the Richepanse de Rouen barracks as a gunner of the 406th artillery regiment. The army accorded him few great favours but there was an exception:\n\n{{cquote|In June 1956, my chiefs finally gave me an order more to my liking, the strangest, the most unusual that a gunner has ever been asked to carry out; it was nothing less than to beat the world [[hour record]]. I knew what that meant: to storm a veritable fortress. For 14 years, since 7 November 1942, the date on which Fausto Coppi planted the Italian flag on it, it had discouraged all assailants. One figure sums up the difficulty of the enterprise: 45.848&nbsp;km.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nShould he break the record, he and the army agreed, he would give half the rewards to the army and the rest to the mother of a soldier, Andr\u00e9 Dufour, who had been killed while fighting at Palestro, in [[Algeria]].<ref name=Chany>Chany, Pierre (1988), ''La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme'', Nathan, France. {{ISBN|2092864319}}</ref> The chances of breaking it were far from guaranteed, not only because Coppi's record had already defied [[Gerrit Schulte]] and [[Louison Bobet]] but also Anquetil himself, on 23 November 1955, when he had started too fast, faded and finished 696&nbsp;m short of Coppi. His second attempt also flopped. He again started too fast. After 54:36 his helpers called him to a stop after 41.326&nbsp;km. His legs failed him when he got off his bike and he had to be carried to a chair in a corner of the [[Velodromo Vigorelli]], the [[velodrome]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The Italian crowd chanted: \"Coppi! Coppi! Coppi!\"<ref name=anquetil /><ref name=anquetil /><ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\n{{cquote|I was like a child's lead soldier that has lost its horse.\"<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nNext day he received a telegram: \"Congratulations on a good performance. Sure of your success. Take your time. Captain Gueguen will arrive tomorrow with instructions. Signed: Commander Dieudonn\u00e9\".<ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\nAt 7:30pm on 29 June 1956, riding a lighter bike made in three days to the same design as Coppi's, and using a 7m40 gear (52x15), Anquetil tried again and finally broke his hero's record, riding 46.159&nbsp;km. Coppi was the first professional to give Anquetil his autograph.<ref>Interview, Magazine 24, ORTF (television), France, 20 November 1963</ref> When the two next met, Anquetil was also a professional. He went to Italy to meet Coppi and, for reasons never explained, dressed as a simple country boy rather than in the smart clothes that he normally wore.\n\n{{cquote|The grandstands fell quiet. They were preparing to take Coppi to the cemetery. I liked that silence. On the 84th lap, Boucher gave me my release. \"''Allez, m\u00f4me, tout''!\" [\"Go, kid, give it everything!\"] Until then I had been well within myself [''J'ai fum\u00e9 ma pipe'']... On a big school blackboard, Captain Gueguen wrote 46.159km. I could lift my arms, sit up and breathe a bit of fresh air. Ah, the public! Those who were whistling me four laps earlier kissed my bike, my jersey, reaching out to touch me in the way they do during processions of holy relics.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nIn 1967, 11 years later, Anquetil again broke the hour record, with 47.493&nbsp;km, but the record was disallowed because he refused to take the newly introduced post-race doping test.<ref name=Cycling /> He objected to what he saw as the indignity of having to urinate in a tent in a crowded velodrome and said he would take the test at his hotel. The international judge ruled against the idea and a scuffle ensued that involved Anquetil's manager, [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]]. ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' reported:<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\" />\n\n<blockquote>Wonderful Jacques Anquetil has broken the world hour record as he said he would... and then ran into official trouble when he refused to take a trackside dope test demanded by the Italian authorities. An Italian Dr Giuliano Marena asked for the urine sample, but Anquetil refused and asked him to come to his hotel. Dr Marena refused and, after waiting a couple of hours at the track, left town to go home to Florence. Anquetil said at his hotel: 'I didn't and don't intend to escape the test, but it must take place under circumstances far different from those at the velodrome. I'm still here and ready to undergo the test.' While Italian officials talked of taking the matter to the UCI, Dr Tanguy of the FFC [French cycling federation] took a sample from Anquetil on his return to Rouen, pointing out afterwards that it would be valid up to 48 hours after the record attempt. But Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, his manager, had all but lost his temper with the Italian medical man and had tried to throw him out of the cabin, though Jacques had remonstrated mildly. Later he said that he understood the tests would be valid for up to 48 hours and said he was trying to locate another doctor for the test.<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\">Cycling, 7 October 1967, p. 4</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Tour de France ==\n[[File:Jacques Anquetil 1963.jpg|thumb|Anquetil at the [[1963 Tour de France]]]]\n[[File:Anquetil Poulidor Bahamontes 1964.jpg|thumb|Anquetil (center) at the [[1964 Tour de France]]]]\nIn 1957 Anquetil rode \u2013 and won \u2013 his first [[1957 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. His inclusion in the national team \u2013 the Tour was still ridden by national rather than commercial teams \u2013 was what the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier called \"a forceps operation\".<ref name=Ollivier>Ollivier, Jean-Paul (1999): ''Maillot Jaune'', Reader's Digest Selection, France</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[[Louison Bobet]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] wished to rule the Tour de France and had no desire to have Anquetil. But Louison, worn out from his battle of nerves that he suffered in the Tour of Italy, where he used all his energy in defending the ''maglia rosa'' [leader's jersey] against Italian hatred [''d\u00e9ferlante''], declared, on the banks of the Adriatic; \"I am not prepared, mentally, to take part in the Tour de France. I am 32 in a world of youth.\"<ref name=Ollivier /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil recognised the allusion and accepted the invitation to ride. He finished nearly 15 minutes ahead of the rest, winning four stages and the team stage.\n\nIn 1959, Anquetil was whistled as he finished the Tour on the [[Parc des Princes]] because spectators calculated that he and others had contrived to let [[Federico Bahamontes]] win rather than the Frenchman [[Henry Anglade]]. The French team was unbalanced by internal rivalries. Anglade, whose bossy nature earned him the nickname [[Napoleon]], was unusual in that he was represented by the agent Roger Piel while the others had Daniel Dousset. The two men controlled French racing.<ref>''Dousset-Piel, l'Age de Bronze'', V\u00e9lo, France November 2005</ref> Dousset worked out that his riders had to beat Bahamontes or make sure that Anglade didn't win. Since they couldn't beat Anglade, they let Bahamontes win because Bahamontes, a poor rider on the flat and on small circuits, would be no threat to the post-Tour criterium fees that made up the bulk of riders' \u2014 and agents' \u2014 earnings.\n\nAnquetil was jeered and showed his coldness to public reaction by buying a boat that he named \"The Whistles of 59\" and by pointing out that he was a professional and that his first interest was money. It was an attitude that other riders understood but made him hard for fans to love .\n\nIn 1960 Anquetil stayed away from the Tour, returning in [[1961 Tour de France|1961]] and winning it thereafter until [[1964 Tour de France|1964]]. He won in [[1962 Tour de France|1962]] at a speed not bettered until [[1981 Tour de France|1981]]. He was the first to win four successive times, breaking the record of three set by [[Philippe Thys]] and [[Louison Bobet]]. He was first to win five times in total, since emulated by [[Eddy Merckx]], [[Bernard Hinault]] and [[Miguel Indurain]].\n\nIn 1963 Tour, at the top of a mountain, Anquetil faked a mechanical problem so that his team director could give him a bicycle more suitable for the descent. The plan worked and Anquetil overtook Bahamontes and won the stage, taking the lead.\n\nHis last Tour victory (in 1964) was his most famous, featuring an elbow-to-elbow duel with public favourite [[Raymond Poulidor]] on the road up the [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me (mountain)|Puy de D\u00f4me mountain]] on 12 July. Suffering indigestion after excesses on a rest day, Anquetil was said to have received a swallow of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] from his team manager \u2014 a story Anquetil's wife says is untrue.\n\nThe Tour organiser, [[Jacques Goddet]], was behind the pair as they turned off the main road and climbed through what the police estimated as half a million spectators. He recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The two, at the extreme of their rivalry, climbing the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman [Anquetil], used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, it was clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.<ref>Goddet, Jacques (1991): ''L'\u00c9quip\u00e9e Belle'', Robert Laffont, France</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil rode on the inside by the mountain wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's gasps on their bare arms. At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Of Anquetil, [[Pierre Chany]] wrote: <blockquote>\"His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks.\"<ref name=Chany /></blockquote> Anquetil was only semi-conscious, he said.<ref name=Chany /> Anquetil's manager, Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, said:\n\n<blockquote>Anquetil's head was a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what happened when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed on the front of my car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' I told him 14 seconds. 'That's one more than I need. I've got 13 in hand'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In my opinion Poulidor was demoralised by Anquetil's resistance, his mental strength. There were three times when he could have dropped Anquetil. First, at the bottom of the climb. Then when Julio Jimenez attacked [and left the two Frenchmen, accompanied by the rival climber Federico Bahamontes]. Finally in the last kilometre. The nearer the summit came, the more Jacques was suffering. In the last few hundred metres, he was losing time. At the top of the Puy it's 13 per cent. Poulidor should have attacked: he didn't. Poulidor didn't attack in the last 500 metres \u2013 it was Jacques who got dropped, and that's not the same thing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nPoulidor gained time but Anquetil still had a 55-second lead in Paris and won his last Tour. The writer [[Chris Sidwells]] said:\n\n<blockquote>The race also ended the Anquetil era in Tour history. He could not face riding it the following year, and in 1966 he retired from the Tour with bad health \u2013 once he'd made sure that Poulidor could not win either.<ref group=\"n\">In 1966 Anquetil prevented Poulidor from winning the Tour by putting his team-mate Lucien Aimar in a position to win.</ref> Poulidor may not have managed to slay his dragon, in fact so bloodied was he by his battle that he never did win the Tour, but he did manage to wound his rival, and in so doing brought down the curtain on the rule of the first five-times winner \u2013 the first great super-champion of the Tour de France.<ref>[[Chris Sidwells|Sidwells, Chris]] (2003) ''Golden Stages of the Tour de France'', comp: Allchin, Richard and Bell, Adrian, Mousehold Press, UK</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil was first to win all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. He twice won the [[Giro d'Italia]] ([[1960 Giro d'Italia|1960]], [[1964 Giro d'Italia|1964]]) and won the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] once ([[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]]). He also won the season-long ''[[Super Prestige Pernod International]]'' four times, in 1961, 1963, 1965 and 1966 \u2014 a record surpassed only by [[Eddy Merckx]].\n\n== Anquetil\u2013Poulidor: the social significance ==\n[[File:Poulidor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Raymond Poulidor]]]]\n\nAnquetil unfailingly beat [[Raymond Poulidor]] in the Tour and yet Poulidor remained more popular. Divisions between their fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. The extent of those divisions is shown in a story, perhaps apocryphal, told by [[Pierre Chany]], who was close to Anquetil:\n\n<blockquote>The Tour de France has the major fault of dividing the country, right down to the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.<ref name=wood /></blockquote>\n\nJean-Luc Boeuf and Yves L\u00e9onard, in their study, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who recognised themselves in Jacques Anquetil liked his priority of style and elegance in the way he rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face \u2013 lined with effort \u2013 represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich.<ref>The authors quote [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], the [[La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]], the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Paris\u2013Nice]].</ref> Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with a hard life, as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in ''Le Figaro'' when it was headlined \"This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex\".<ref>''Le Monde'', 16 April 2002, supplement page 3</ref><ref>Boeuf, Jean Luc and L\u00e9onard Yves (2003), ''La R\u00e9publique du Tour de France'', Seuil, France. {{ISBN|202058073X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Dauphin\u00e9 and Bordeaux\u2013Paris double ==\nIn 1965, Anquetil won the eight-day Alpine [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9]] Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 stage race at 3pm, sat through two hours of interviews and receptions, took a chartered flight in a French Mirage fighter plane (allegedly organised by President Charles de Gaulle, a big admirer of his) to [[Bordeaux]] at 6.30pm and won the world's longest single-day classic, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]], the following day. The race started at night and continued from after dawn behind [[derny]] motorcycle pacers.\n\nAnquetil was upset, said G\u00e9miniani, that Poulidor was always more warmly regarded even though he had never won the Tour. In 1965, when Poulidor was perceived to have received more credit for dropping Anquetil the previous year on the Puy-de-D\u00f4me than Anquetil had for winning the whole Tour, G\u00e9miniani persuaded him to ride the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and, next day, Bordeaux\u2013Paris. That, he said, would end any argument over who was the greater.\n\nAnquetil won the Dauphin\u00e9, despite bad weather which he disliked, at 3pm. After two hours of interviews and receptions he flew from N\u00eemes to Bordeaux. At midnight, he ate his pre-race meal and went to the start in the city's northern suburbs.\n\nHe could eat little during the night because of stomach cramp and was on the verge of retiring. G\u00e9miniani swore and called him \"a great poof\" to offend his pride and keep him riding.<ref>{{YouTube|Oz7kIltIpsY}}</ref> Anquetil felt better as morning came and the riders dropped in behind the [[derny]] pacing motorcycles that were a feature of the race. He responded to an attack by [[Tom Simpson]], followed by his own team-mate [[Jean Stablinski]]. Anquetil and Stablinski attacked Simpson alternately, forcing Simpson to exhaust himself, and Anquetil won at the [[Parc des Princes]]. Stablinski finished 57 seconds later just ahead of Simpson.<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm Anquetil's impossible double] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002194650/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm |date=2 October 2007 }}. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\nThe historian Dick Yates said:\n<blockquote>It had been one of the hardest and closest [[derny]]-paced races in history but much more than that this double of Anquetil was one of the greatest exploits ever seen in cycling. At the [[Parc des Princes]], Anquetil received the biggest ovation of his career, certainly much bigger than after any of his wins in the Tour. The race record was broken, Jacques was mobbed by reporters and photographers but he was tired and really had to get some rest. Few people realised it at the time but he had to make the long journey to [[Maubeuge]] in north-eastern France where the following day he was riding a [[criterium]]!<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\">Cycling News, UK, December 1997, p. 19</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere are undenied rumours that the jet laid on to get Anquetil to Bordeaux was provided through state funds on the orders of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]. G\u00e9miniani mentions the belief in his biography, without denying it, saying the truth will come out when state records are opened.\n\n== Trofeo Baracchi ==\nAnquetil's most humiliating race was the [[Trofeo Baracchi]] in Italy in 1962, when he had to be pushed by his partner, [[Rudi Altig]], and was so exhausted that he hit a pillar before reaching the track on which the race finished.\n\nThe Trofeo Baracchi was a 111&nbsp;km race for two-man teams. Anquetil, the world's best time-triallist, and Altig, a powerful rider with a strong sprint, were favourites. But things soon went wrong. The writer [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I got my stopwatch going again to check the length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check \u2014 and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport \u2014 something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front \u2014 and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe pair reached the track on which the race finished. The timekeeper was at the entrance to the stadium, so Anquetil finished. But instead of turning on to the [[velodrome]], he rode straight on and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds.\n\n== Other races ==\nAnquetil was not as successful in the classic single-day races but towards the end of his career he won:\n* [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] (1964)\n* [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] (1966)\n\nAnquetil finished in the top 10 in the [[world cycling championship|world championship]] on six occasions, but second place in 1966 was the nearest he came to the rainbow jersey.<ref name=\"sports-reference\" />\n\n== Riding style ==\nAnquetil was a smooth rider, a beautiful pedalling machine according to the American journalist Owen Mulholland:\n\n<blockquote>The sight of Jacques Anquetil on a bicycle gives credence to an idea we Americans find unpalatable, that of a natural aristocracy. From the first day he seriously straddled a top tube, \"Anq\" had a sense or perfection most riders spend a lifetime searching for. Between 1950, when he rode his first race, and nineteen years later, when he retired, Anquetil had countless frames underneath him, yet that indefinable poise was always there.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The look was that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were extended more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes pointed down. Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques was the first of the big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on his thin [[Mafac]] brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|title=Bikerace Info, Rider database, Jacques Anquetil|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821072612/http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Physical attributes ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Height:\n| 1.76 m\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Weight:\n| {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref>These and other details published 1966 in ''En Br\u00fblant les \u00c9tapes'', Jacques Anquetil, published Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Chest:\n| 95&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Arm circumference:\n| 27&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Calf circumference:\n| 32&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Thigh circumference:\n| 47&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Foot size:\n| 41\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Lung capacity:\n| 6 litres\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Normal heart rate:\n| 48\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Heart rate after exercise:\n| 90\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Training:\n| 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, three times a week\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Gym training:\n| 20 minutes, twice a week\n|-\n!! style=\"text-align:right\"|Diet:\n| No restrictions other than sauces.

Dick Yates wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Rapha\u00ebl embarked on a policy of trying to convince Jacques of the need to win more races as he certainly had the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but G\u00e9miniani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how a man of his talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\" /></blockquote>\n\nAs a partnership they won four Tours de France, two Giro d'Italia, the [[Dauphin\u00e9-Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] and then next day, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]]. G\u00e9miniani said of him:\n<blockquote>Today, everybody pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I can still hear the way he was whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial<ref group=\"n\">Anquetil was the dominant time-triallist of his period</ref> to make him lose. His home town of [[Rouen]] organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in [[Antwerp]] that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a [[Amateur|dilettante]]. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (''il les a tous couillonn\u00e9s'').<ref>L'Express 19 June 2003</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Honours ==\nAnquetil was named France's champion of champions by [[L'\u00c9quipe]] in 1963. He was appointed Chevalier de l'[[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]] in 1965 (cross of merit) and Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] on 5 October 1966.\n\n== Personal life ==\nAnquetil was fascinated by astronomy and was delighted to meet [[Yuri Gagarin]]. The rational side of his character contrasted with his superstition. In the [[1964 Tour de France]], a fortune-teller called Belline predicted in [[France-Soir]] that Anquetil would die on or around the 13th day of the race. His wife Janine, knowing Anquetil's superstition, hid the paper but Anquetil found out, not least because he was sent cuttings with unsigned letters.<ref name=letour>Le Tour de France, Jean-Paul Brouchon, Balland-Jacob-Duvernet, 2000</ref>\n\nJean-Paul Brouchon, leading cycling commentator at the news radio station France-Info, said of the day the forecast was supposed to come true:\n\n<blockquote>During those dark hours, Anquetil refused to leave his room [the race was having a rest day]. Finally he agreed to go for a short car ride with [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] [his team manager] and Janine, to join a party organised by Radio Andorra.<ref name=letour /></blockquote>\n\nA mixture of Anquetil's fear for the future and his enjoyment of living in the present led to newspaper pictures of the large meal and the wine that he drank that day. Next morning, still worried about the prediction and laden down by partying, he was dropped on the first hairpins of the [[Port d'Envalira]].\n\nHe was famous for preparing for races by staying up all night drinking and playing cards, although the story seems to have increased with the telling. Nevertheless, his teammate, the British rider [[Vin Denson]], has written in ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' of exuberant parties during races. Denson has written, too, of Anquetil's scrupulous business arrangements with riders and others:\n\n<blockquote>I always considered Jacques to be the very best professional\", he said. \"I admired him for the gentlemanly manner and charm with riders, the public and media. A more honest and sincere businessman and friend you would not find in any walk of life. His word was his all and was of great importance to him. He was a truly great man and champion who will be greatly missed and impossible to replace.<ref name=Cycling>''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' 26 November 1987</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe British journalist Alan Gayfer, former editor of [[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]] said:\n\n<blockquote>Jacques was a real Norman with the nuances of speech that make the Normans famous, they almost say Yes to mean No, and vice versa. I asked him when he was in London if Poulidor, who was often second to Jacques, could ever win the Tour de France: \"Yes\", he said, \"but only if I am riding, and I would always finish ahead of him.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But perhaps my finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], where a German official had been particularly rude to myself and other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike from the back of the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nDick Yates said:\n<blockquote>\"He had a deep love of the land and was at his happiest when driving a tractor. They [his wife and he] both acquired a taste for bridge parties which often continued late into the night. That Anquetil was a highly intelligent man there can be no doubt and he was the nearest thing to a true intellectual that cycling has ever produced.\"<ref>Cycling News, UK, December 1999, p20</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil married Janine Boeda on 22 December 1958. She had been married to Anquetil's doctor. The doctor, seeing a rival, sent his wife to live with friends.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\">Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Anquetil went to see her, disguised as a plumber,<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> and took her to Paris to buy clothes in the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nTheir marriage produced no children. Janine had two children, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Janine had two failed pregnancies and Anquetil grew upset in 1970 that he was not a father.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> The couple considered a surrogate mother before Janine thought of her daughter, Annie. Janine said: \"We didn't use the parental authority that we could have had over her. It was a request that I addressed to her. Gently. Annie always had the choice of refusing.\"<ref group=\"n\">''Non; nous n'avons pas abus\u00e9 de l'ascendant que nous pouvions sur elle. C'est une pri\u00e8re que je lui ai adresse\u00e9e. Gentiment. Annie avait toujours le choix de refuser.'' Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Annie confirmed her mother's recollection.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> She said:\n\n{{cquote|When my mother asked that [I should become impregnated by my step-father, Anquetil].... I was totally breathtaken by the proposition.... But, mind, I accepted willingly. I have to admit that at the time, despite being 18 years old, I was in love with Jacques. And I knew that I pleased him. What do you expect? That's life. And that's how I found myself in his bed in the sacred mission of procreation.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />}}\n\nAnquetil, his wife and his wife's daughter began a ''[[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]]''<ref>Anquetil, Sophie (2004) ''Pour l'Amour de Jacques'', Grasset, France</ref> Annie said:\n{{cquote|\"Nobody thought it strange that Jacques Anquetil joined me in my bed each evening before returning to the marital bed beside my mother. Everybody was comfortable with it [''Tout le monde \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'aise''].\"<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />}}\n\nAnnie said she should have left the house after her daughter, Sophie, was born (in 2004, Sophie Anquetil published the book ''Pour l'amour de Jacques'' in which she confirmed what had been rumoured but what Anquetil had always tried to hide:<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> that she was Anquetil's daughter). Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded she leave instead.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> When Janine refused, Annie left. To fill the gap, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, ''Les Elfes'', where she organises conferences.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in [[Calenzana]], near [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\n== Doping ==\nAnquetil never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux\u2013Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through \"the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains\", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said, before adding: \"Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope.\"<ref>Cited in ''Les Miroirs du Tour'', French television, 2003</ref> There was implied acceptance of doping right to the top of the state: [[Charles de Gaulle]] said: \"Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the [[Marseillaise]] [the national anthem] abroad?\"<ref>Cited ''L'\u00c9quipe Magazine'' 23 July 1994</ref>\n\nAnquetil won [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] in 1966.  An official named Collard told him there would be a drugs test once he had got changed. \"Too late\", Anquetil said. \"If you can collect it from the soapy water there, go ahead. I'm a human being, not a fountain.\" Collard said he would return half an hour later; Anquetil said he would have left for a dinner appointment 140&nbsp;km away. Two days later the Belgian cycling federation disqualified Anquetil and fined him. Anquetil responded by calling urine tests \"a threat to individual liberty\" and engaged a lawyer. The case was never heard, the Belgians backed down and Anquetil became the winner.\n\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Jacques had the strength \u2013 for which he was always criticised \u2013 to say out loud what others would only whisper. So, when I asked him 'What have you taken?' he didn't drop his eyes before replying. He had the strength of conviction.|source=[[Pierre Chany]] on Anquetil <ref>Penot, Christophe (1996) ''Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France'', \u00c9ditions Cristel, France. {{ISBN|2-9510116-0-1}}</ref>|quoted=1}}\n\nAnquetil argued that professional riders were workers and had the same right to treat their pains, as say, a geography teacher. But the argument found less support as more riders were reported to have died or suffered health problems through drug-related incidents, including the [[death of Tom Simpson]], in the 1967 Tour de France.<ref name=Cycling />\n\nHowever, there was great support in the cyclist community for Anquetil's argument that, if there were to be rules and tests, the tests should be carried out consistently and with dignity. He said it was professional dignity, the right of a champion not to be ridiculed in front of his public, that led to his refusal to take a test in the centre of the Vigorelli track after breaking the world hour record.\n\nThe unrecognised time that Anquetil set that day was nevertheless broken by the Belgian rider [[Ferdinand Bracke]]. Anquetil was hurt that the French government had never sent him a telegram of congratulations but sent one to Bracke, who was not French. It was a measure of the unacceptability of Anquetil's arguments, as was the way he was quietly dropped from future French teams.\n\n== Anquetil and Britain ==\nBritish fans voted Anquetil the [[BBC]]'s international personality of 1964. He appeared with [[Tom Simpson]] from a studio in Paris. The Franco-American journalist [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In the studio we watched the proceedings in London, and while I cannot say Anquetil was keenly interested in the cricketing part, he was impressed with the general presentation which, however (like the stages of the 1964 Tour) he found a bit long. He was interested, though, to see [[Beryl Burton]], and his old acquaintance [[Reg Harris]] pulling at his pipe in the invited audience.<ref>''Sporting Cyclist'', UK, 1965</ref></blockquote>\n\nA few days later, Anquetil was named French sportsman of the year.\n\nAnquetil was fascinated by British enthusiasm for time-trialling and in 1961 presented prizes at the [[Road Time Trials Council]] evening at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to honour [[Beryl Burton]] and Brian Kirby.<ref name=Cycling /> The pair had won the women's and men's [[British Best All-Rounder]] competitions (BBAR) for, respectively, the highest average speed in a season over 25, 50 and 100 miles (women) and 50 and {{convert|100|mi|km}} and 12 hours (men).\n\nAlan Gayfer, the editor of ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' at the time of Anquetil's death, wrote in appreciation:\n<blockquote>It is strange to look back and see how this frail-looking young man burst on the scene in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to challenge for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160&nbsp;km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1964 Anquetil discussed riding a British 25&nbsp;mile (40&nbsp;km) race. Gayfer and Tom Simpson explained that the course would be flat and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who could predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the British record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.\n\nAnquetil asked \u00a31,000 to compete and a London timber merchant called Vic Jenner said he would put up the money. Jenner had often put money into the sport. He died shortly afterwards, however, and the ride never happened.<ref>Cited \"Cycling: the golden years\", Springfield Press, UK</ref>\n\nAnquetil took part, with Simpson, in an afternoon of exhibition racing at the Herne Hill track in South London, on 13 June 1964 \u2013 three weeks before starting in the 1964 Tour de France.\n\nAnquetil rode on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1959, 1962 and in 1965, when he won the [[Manx Trophy|Manx Premier]] by beating [[Eddy Merckx]] into second place.<ref name=Cycling />\n\n== Retirement and death ==\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teaufort 78 Anquetil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A memorial plaque to Anquetil in [[Ch\u00e2teaufort, Yvelines|Ch\u00e2teaufort]], France]]\n[[File:Anquetil's memorial at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A memorial to Anquetil in [[Quincampoix]], France]]\nAnquetil rode his last race not in France, of which he still despaired for its preferring Poulidor, but on 27 December 1969 on the track at [[Antwerp]]. It happened, wrote ''L'\u00c9quipe'' \"to the great indifference of the media.\"<ref group=\"n\">L'\u00c9quipe said Anquetil's  farewell race was in Charleroi. Other reports agree that it was Antwerp.</ref> He retired to a farm at Le Domaine des Elfes, [[La Neuville-Chant-d'Oisel]], 17&nbsp;km from Rouen. The ch\u00e2teau, formerly owned by [[Guy de Maupassant]], was surrounded by 170 hectares.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nAnquetil was a correspondent for L'\u00c9quipe, consultant for [[Europe 1]] and then on Antenne 2, a race director for [[Paris\u2013Nice]] and the [[Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en]] and in Canada, [[directeur sportif]] of French teams at world championships,<ref name=Cycling /> and a member of the managing committee of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Cyclisme]]. His radio analyses were sharp and he gained notoriety in Belgium for telling [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]], the Spanish rider living in France, how to beat Eddy Merckx.\n\nHe rode his bike only three times in retirement, saying he had already ridden enough. He rode the Grand Prix des Gentlemen in [[Nice]], a race in which old riders were paired with current competitors; he went out for an afternoon with friends in Normandy; and he joined his daughter for a bike ride on her birthday. Other than that, he did not ride his bike after 1969.\n\nOn 18 November 1987, Jacques Anquetil died of [[stomach cancer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=25|title=Cycling Hall of Fame.com|website=www.cyclinghalloffame.com}}</ref> in his sleep at 6{{nbsp}}am at the St-Hilaire Clinic in [[Rouen]]. He had been there since 10 October. The clinic said: \"His state of health had visibly deteriorated over the last hours and he died in his sleep after showing great courage throughout his illness.\"<ref name=Cycling /> Anquetil is buried beside the church in Quincampoix, north of Rouen, where a large black monument by the traffic lights lists his achievements. There is a further monument at the Piste Municipale in Paris, where the centre is named after him.\n\nThe Jacques Anquetil sports stadium at Quincampoix was dedicated in 1983. There are moves to open a museum in his memory.\n\nThe historian Richard Yates wrote:\n[[File:Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix, France]]\n<blockquote>He finally came to be respected as one of the most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques was one of the most gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made G\u00e9miniani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>His inherent shyness can never fully explain his apparent cold indifference. His roots in the Normandy countryside may explain his love of the land but could not excuse his inability to even make a generous gesture. The hard life that his father had experienced could never pardon the economy of effort with which Jacques was obsessed. In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort. He spent most of the time at the back of the bunch and did not even know the name of most of the riders.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Tour visited Rouen on the 10th anniversary of Anquetil's death. There to remember his first victory in the race were his team-mates, Gilbert Bauvin, Louis Bergard, [[Albert Bouvet]], [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]], Jean Forestier, [[Andr\u00e9 Mah\u00e9]], Ren\u00e9 Privat and [[Jean Stablinski]]. There, too, was the team car from Anquetil's first Tour, driven by the man behind the wheel that year, William Odin.<ref>Cycling, \"Anquetil anniversary celebrations\", 5 July 1997</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nAnquetil made an appearance in cartoon form in the animated movie ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]] (Les Triplettes de Belleville)'' (''Belleville Rendez-vous'' in the British release).\n\nThe French film ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' may contain an indirect reference to Anquetil.  A long-lost box of souvenirs found by Am\u00e9lie reminds an ageing estranged father of the time he cheered [[Federico Bahamontes]]' win of the 1959 Tour (Anquetil, a long-time rival of Bahamontes, came third). Am\u00e9lie is later romantically pursued by Nino Quincampoix, who shares a rare surname with the village where Anquetil is buried.\n\n==Career achievements==\n===Major results===\n\nSource:<ref
