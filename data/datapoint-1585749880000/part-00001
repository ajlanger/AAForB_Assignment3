After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9]]s.<ref name=rbth>{{cite web\n |author      = Egorov, O.\n |url         = https://www.rbth.com/history/331476-russian-white-generals\n |title       = Meet Russian Imperial officers who almost stopped the Bolsheviks\n |publisher   = Russia Beyond the Headlines\n |date        = 2019-12-27\n |accessdate  = 2020-01-29\n}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nWrangel was born in [[Zarasai|Novalexandrovsk]], [[Kovno Governorate]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now Zarasai, [[Lithuania]]). The [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German noble]] [[Wrangel family]] was part of the [[Uradel]] (old nobility), the family was of [[Danish people|Dano]]-[[Germans|German]] origin, but their origin place was largely unknown. The family first appeared in [[Virumaa|Wierland]] (now Virumaa) of [[Duchy of Estonia (1219\u20131346)|Danish Estonia]] around the 13th Century. Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel was only distantly related to the famed Arctic explorer [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]] and the Prussian Generalfeldmarschall [[Friedrich von Wrangel]]. \n\n==Early life==\nWhile he was of [[Baltic German]] roots, he was a [[Russian Orthodox]] because his [[Lutheran]] grandfather, Baron Hans Georg Hermann von Wrangel, married a Russian woman, and all of his descendants were baptized Orthodox, creating a Russian branch of the family.\n\nAfter graduating from the [[Rostov]] Technical High School in 1896 and the Institute of Mining Engineering in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1901, Wrangel volunteered for the prestigious [[Russian Imperial Guard|Life Guards]] [[cavalry]] and was commissioned a reserve [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in 1902 after graduating from the [[Nikolaev Cavalry School]]. He soon resigned his commission and travelled to [[Irkutsk]], where he was assigned to special missions by the [[Governor-General]].\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Eristov & Wrangel. Kauschen 1914.jpg|thumb|Wrangel and Prince [[Simon Sidamon-Eristoff|Sidamon-Eristavi]] at a captured German cannon in 1914]]\nAt the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904, he re-enlisted and was assigned to the 2nd Regiment of the [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossack Corps]]. In December 1904, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. \n\nAfter the war ended, in January 1906, he was reassigned to the 55th Finland Dragoon Regiment, which, under General A. N. Orlov, took part in pacifying rebels in Siberia. In 1907, he returned to the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. In 1908, he married Olga Mikhaylovna Ivanenko in St. Petersburg, and they produced two sons and two daughters.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=166380230 New York Times obituary of his last surviving child]</ref> Wrangel graduated from the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|Nicholas Imperial General Staff Academy]] in 1910 and the Cavalry Officers' School in 1911.\n\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Wrangel was promoted to captain and assigned command of a cavalry squadron. On October 13, 1914, he became one of the first Russian officers to be awarded the [[Order of St. George]] (4th degree) in the war, the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire. In December 1914, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In October 1915, Wrangel was transferred to the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] and was appointed commander of the 1st Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nThe unit was very active in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] against the [[Empire of Austria|Austrians]], and Wrangel distinguished himself especially during the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. He was promoted to the rank of major general in January 1917 and took command of the 2nd Brigade of the Ussuri Cavalry Division, which was merged with other cavalry units to become the Consolidated Cavalry Corps in July that year. He was further decorated with the George Cross (4th degree) for his defense of the [[Zbruch River]] in the summer of 1917.\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0439\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442.jpg|thumb|140px|left|White propaganda poster, c. 1919]]\n\n== Russian Civil War==\nAfter the end of Russia's participation in the war, Wrangel resigned his commission and went to live at his [[dacha]] at [[Yalta]], in the [[Crimea]]. Arrested by the [[Bolsheviks]] at the end of 1917, he was released and escaped to [[Kiev]], where he joined [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]'s [[Ukrainian State]]. However, it was soon apparent to him that the new government existed only because of the waning support of Germany, and in August 1918, he joined the anti-Bolshevik [[Volunteer Army]] based at [[Krasnodar|Yekaterinodar]], where he was given command of the 1st Cavalry Division and the rank of major general in the [[White movement]]. After the [[Second Kuban Campaign]] in late 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and his division was raised to that of a [[army corps|corps]].\n\n[[File:Government of South Russia 1920 cropped.JPG|thumb|The [[Government of South Russia]] established in [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]] in April 1920]]\nAs an aggressive commander, he won a number of victories in the north of Caucasus. In January 1919, his military force was renamed to the [[Caucasus Volunteer Army]]. Wrangel soon clashed politically with [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] leader [[Anton Denikin]], who demanded a quick march on [[Moscow]]. Wrangel insisted that his forces should instead take [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] first, to join up with the army of Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], [[Battle of Tsaritsyn|which his troops accomplished]] on June 30, 1919, after three previous attempts by [[Pyotr Krasnov]] had failed in 1918.\n\nWrangel gained a reputation as a skilled and just administrator, who, unlike some other White Army generals, did not tolerate lawlessness or looting by his troops.<ref>Lincoln, p. 430.</ref> However, after he was unable to join forces with Admiral Kolchak and at the insistence of Denikin, he led his forces north towards Moscow on a [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|failed attempt by the Whites to take it]] in autumn 1919. Continuing disagreement with Denikin led to his removal from command, and Wrangel departed for exile to [[Constantinople]] on February 8, 1920.[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b \u0432 \u00ab\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044f\u00bb \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435.jpg|thumb|Wrangel, Metropolitan [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)|Anthony]], Metropolitan [[Anastasius (Gribanovsky)|Anastasius]] and other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Yugoslavia, 1927]]\n[[File:General Wrangel Statue.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Statue of Wrangel in [[Sremski Karlovci]]]]\n\nHowever, Denikin was forced to resign on March 20, 1920, and a military committee, led by General [[Abram Dragomirov]] in [[Sevastopol]], asked for Wrangel's return as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the White forces in Crimea. He assumed that post on April 4, 1920, at the head of the ''[[Army of Wrangel|Russian Army]]'', and he put forth a coalition government that attempted to institute sweeping reforms (including land reforms).<ref>Luckett, pp. 359-360.</ref> He also recognized and established relations with the new (and short-lived) anti-Bolshevik independent republics of [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHowever, by that stage in the [[Russian Civil War]], such measures were too late, and the White movement was rapidly losing support, both domestically and overseas.\nWrangel is immortalized by the nickname of \"Black Baron\" in the marching song ''[[The Red Army is the Strongest]]'', composed as a rallying call for a final effort on the part of the Bolsheviks to end the war. The song was immensely popular in the early Soviet Union in the 1920s.\n\n[[File:Wrangel in Sevastopol, 1920.jpg|left|thumb|210px|At a prayer vigil upon accepting command.]]\n\nAfter defeats in which he lost half his standing army and facing [[Northern Taurida Operation|defeat in Northern Tavria]] and [[Siege of Perekop (1920)|in the Crimea]], Wrangel organised [[Evacuation of the Crimea (1920)|a mass evacuation]] on the shores of the [[Black Sea]].<ref>Luckett, pp. 381ff.</ref> Wrangel gave every officer, soldier and civilian the choice to evacuate and go with him into the unknown or to remain in Russia and face the wrath of the Red Army.<ref name=rbth/> Wrangel evacuated the White forces from the Crimea in 1920; the remnants of the Russian Imperial Navy that became known as [[Wrangel's fleet]].

After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9]]s.<ref name=rbth>{{cite web\n |author      = Egorov, O.\n |url         = https://www.rbth.com/history/331476-russian-white-generals\n |title       = Meet Russian Imperial officers who almost stopped the Bolsheviks\n |publisher   = Russia Beyond the Headlines\n |date        = 2019-12-27\n |accessdate  = 2020-01-29\n}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nWrangel was born in [[Zarasai|Novalexandrovsk]], [[Kovno Governorate]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now Zarasai, [[Lithuania]]). The [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German noble]] [[Wrangel family]] was part of the [[Uradel]] (old nobility), the family was of [[Danish people|Dano]]-[[Germans|German]] origin, but their origin place was largely unknown. The family first appeared in [[Virumaa|Wierland]] (now Virumaa) of [[Duchy of Estonia (1219\u20131346)|Danish Estonia]] around the 13th Century. Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel was only distantly related to the famed Arctic explorer [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]] and the Prussian Generalfeldmarschall [[Friedrich von Wrangel]]. \n\n==Early life==\nWhile he was of [[Baltic German]] roots, he was a [[Russian Orthodox]] because his [[Lutheran]] grandfather, Baron Hans Georg Hermann von Wrangel, married a Russian woman, and all of his descendants were baptized Orthodox, creating a Russian branch of the family.\n\nAfter graduating from the [[Rostov]] Technical High School in 1896 and the Institute of Mining Engineering in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1901, Wrangel volunteered for the prestigious [[Russian Imperial Guard|Life Guards]] [[cavalry]] and was commissioned a reserve [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in 1902 after graduating from the Nikolaev Cavalry School. He soon resigned his commission and travelled to [[Irkutsk]], where he was assigned to special missions by the [[Governor-General]].\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Eristov & Wrangel. Kauschen 1914.jpg|thumb|Wrangel and Prince [[Simon Sidamon-Eristoff|Sidamon-Eristavi]] at a captured German cannon in 1914]]\nAt the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904, he re-enlisted and was assigned to the 2nd Regiment of the [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossack Corps]]. In December 1904, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. \n\nAfter the war ended, in January 1906, he was reassigned to the 55th Finland Dragoon Regiment, which, under General A. N. Orlov, took part in pacifying rebels in Siberia. In 1907, he returned to the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. In 1908, he married Olga Mikhaylovna Ivanenko in St. Petersburg, and they produced two sons and two daughters.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=166380230 New York Times obituary of his last surviving child]</ref> Wrangel graduated from the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|Nicholas Imperial General Staff Academy]] in 1910 and the Cavalry Officers' School in 1911.\n\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Wrangel was promoted to captain and assigned command of a cavalry squadron. On October 13, 1914, he became one of the first Russian officers to be awarded the [[Order of St. George]] (4th degree) in the war, the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire. In December 1914, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In October 1915, Wrangel was transferred to the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] and was appointed commander of the 1st Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nThe unit was very active in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] against the [[Empire of Austria|Austrians]], and Wrangel distinguished himself especially during the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. He was promoted to the rank of major general in January 1917 and took command of the 2nd Brigade of the Ussuri Cavalry Division, which was merged with other cavalry units to become the Consolidated Cavalry Corps in July that year. He was further decorated with the George Cross (4th degree) for his defense of the [[Zbruch River]] in the summer of 1917.\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0439\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442.jpg|thumb|140px|left|White propaganda poster, c. 1919]]\n\n== Russian Civil War==\nAfter the end of Russia's participation in the war, Wrangel resigned his commission and went to live at his [[dacha]] at [[Yalta]], in the [[Crimea]]. Arrested by the [[Bolsheviks]] at the end of 1917, he was released and escaped to [[Kiev]], where he joined [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]'s [[Ukrainian State]]. However, it was soon apparent to him that the new government existed only because of the waning support of Germany, and in August 1918, he joined the anti-Bolshevik [[Volunteer Army]] based at [[Krasnodar|Yekaterinodar]], where he was given command of the 1st Cavalry Division and the rank of major general in the [[White movement]]. After the [[Second Kuban Campaign]] in late 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and his division was raised to that of a [[army corps|corps]].\n\n[[File:Government of South Russia 1920 cropped.JPG|thumb|The [[Government of South Russia]] established in [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]] in April 1920]]\nAs an aggressive commander, he won a number of victories in the north of Caucasus. In January 1919, his military force was renamed to the [[Caucasus Volunteer Army]]. Wrangel soon clashed politically with [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] leader [[Anton Denikin]], who demanded a quick march on [[Moscow]]. Wrangel insisted that his forces should instead take [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] first, to join up with the army of Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], [[Battle of Tsaritsyn|which his troops accomplished]] on June 30, 1919, after three previous attempts by [[Pyotr Krasnov]] had failed in 1918.\n\nWrangel gained a reputation as a skilled and just administrator, who, unlike some other White Army generals, did not tolerate lawlessness or looting by his troops.<ref>Lincoln, p. 430.</ref> However, after he was unable to join forces with Admiral Kolchak and at the insistence of Denikin, he led his forces north towards Moscow on a [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|failed attempt by the Whites to take it]] in autumn 1919. Continuing disagreement with Denikin led to his removal from command, and Wrangel departed for exile to [[Constantinople]] on February 8, 1920.[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b \u0432 \u00ab\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044f\u00bb \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435.jpg|thumb|Wrangel, Metropolitan [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)|Anthony]], Metropolitan [[Anastasius (Gribanovsky)|Anastasius]] and other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Yugoslavia, 1927]]\n[[File:General Wrangel Statue.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Statue of Wrangel in [[Sremski Karlovci]]]]\n\nHowever, Denikin was forced to resign on March 20, 1920, and a military committee, led by General [[Abram Dragomirov]] in [[Sevastopol]], asked for Wrangel's return as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the White forces in Crimea. He assumed that post on April 4, 1920, at the head of the ''[[Army of Wrangel|Russian Army]]'', and he put forth a coalition government that attempted to institute sweeping reforms (including land reforms).<ref>Luckett, pp. 359-360.</ref> He also recognized and established relations with the new (and short-lived) anti-Bolshevik independent republics of [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHowever, by that stage in the [[Russian Civil War]], such measures were too late, and the White movement was rapidly losing support, both domestically and overseas.\nWrangel is immortalized by the nickname of \"Black Baron\" in the marching song ''[[The Red Army is the Strongest]]'', composed as a rallying call for a final effort on the part of the Bolsheviks to end the war. The song was immensely popular in the early Soviet Union in the 1920s.\n\n[[File:Wrangel in Sevastopol, 1920.jpg|left|thumb|210px|At a prayer vigil upon accepting command.]]\n\nAfter defeats in which he lost half his standing army and facing [[Northern Taurida Operation|defeat in Northern Tavria]] and [[Siege of Perekop (1920)|in the Crimea]], Wrangel organised [[Evacuation of the Crimea (1920)|a mass evacuation]] on the shores of the [[Black Sea]].<ref>Luckett, pp. 381ff.</ref> Wrangel gave every officer, soldier and civilian the choice to evacuate and go with him into the unknown or to remain in Russia and face the wrath of the Red Army.<ref name=rbth/> Wrangel evacuated the White forces from the Crimea in 1920; the remnants of the Russian Imperial Navy that became known as [[Wrangel's fleet]].

Wrangel, who was then on shore, escaped with his life in what was widely regarded as an assassination attempt.\n\n=== Emigration===\nIn 1922, he moved to the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] as the head of all [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White Russian]] refugees, and he arguably became the most prominent of all [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]].\n\nIn 1924, in the Serbian town of [[Sremski Karlovci]], he established the [[Russian All-Military Union]], an ostensibly-civilian organisation that was designed to embrace all Russian military \u00e9migr\u00e9s all over the world,<ref>[https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/wrangel_petr_nikolaevich_baron Wrangel, Petr Nikolaevich, Baron]</ref> with a view to preserving a Russian military organisation for the eventuality of having to fight Bolshevism again.<ref name=\"politikarovs\">\u2033\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0438 \u0446\u0438\u0459 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u0430\u2033. // ''[[Politika]]'', 7 December 2017, p. 21.</ref> \n\nIn September 1927, Wrangel and his family settled in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], where he worked as a mining engineer. \n\nWrangel's [[memoirs]] were published in the magazine ''White Cause'' (\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e) in [[Berlin]] in 1928.\n\n==Death and burial==\nWrangel died suddenly on April 25, 1928, and his family believed that he had been poisoned by his butler's brother, who briefly lived in the his household in Brussels and was allegedly a [[Soviet]] agent.<ref name=\"Boris Volodarsky\">Volodarsky, Boris. \"The KGB's Poison Factory, from Lenin to Litvinenko\".
