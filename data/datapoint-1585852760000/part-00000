Windows 7 continued improvements on [[Windows Aero]] (the [[user interface]] introduced in Windows Vista) with the addition of a redesigned [[taskbar]] that allows applications to be \"pinned\" to it, and new window management features. Other new features were added to the operating system, including libraries, the new file sharing system HomeGroup, and support for [[multitouch]] input. A new \"Action Center\" interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the [[User Account Control]] system to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including [[Internet Explorer 8]], [[Windows Media Player]], and [[Windows Media Center]].\n\nIn contrast to Windows Vista, Windows 7 was generally praised by critics, who considered the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor due to its increased performance, its more intuitive interface (with particular praise devoted to the new taskbar), fewer User Account Control popups, and other improvements made across the platform. Windows 7 was a major success for Microsoft; even prior to its official release, pre-order sales for the operating system on the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] had surpassed previous records. In just six months, over 100 million copies had been sold worldwide, increasing to over 630 million licenses by July 2012. {{As of|2020|04}}, 21.21% of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 7 (and thus 16% of all traditional PCs),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201803-202003|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> which still has well over 50% market share in some countries.<!--e.g. in Turkmenistan at 54-62%--><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/turkmenistan/#monthly-201810-202003|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Turkmenistan|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/turkmenistan/#quarterly-201804-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Turkmenistan|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> <!--while still most popular in China at 43.57%,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/china/#monthly-201803-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share China|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> -->\n\n== Development history ==\nOriginally, a version of Windows codenamed \"Blackcomb\" was planned as the successor to [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] in 2000.

However, an interim, minor release, codenamed \"Longhorn,\" was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/24/gates_confirms_windows_longhorn|title=Gates confirms Windows Longhorn for 2003|last=Lettice|first=John|date=October 24, 2001|website=The Register|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb.

Windows 7 continued improvements on [[Windows Aero]] (the [[user interface]] introduced in Windows Vista) with the addition of a redesigned [[taskbar]] that allows applications to be \"pinned\" to it, and new window management features. Other new features were added to the operating system, including libraries, the new file sharing system HomeGroup, and support for [[multitouch]] input. A new \"Action Center\" interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the [[User Account Control]] system to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including [[Internet Explorer 8]], [[Windows Media Player]], and [[Windows Media Center]].\n\nIn contrast to Windows Vista, Windows 7 was generally praised by critics, who considered the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor due to its increased performance, its more intuitive interface (with particular praise devoted to the new taskbar), fewer User Account Control popups, and other improvements made across the platform. Windows 7 was a major success for Microsoft; even prior to its official release, pre-order sales for the operating system on the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] had surpassed previous records. In just six months, over 100 million copies had been sold worldwide, increasing to over 630 million licenses by July 2012. {{As of|2020|04}}, 21.21% of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 7 (and thus 16% of all traditional PCs),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201803-202003|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> which still has over 60% market share <!-- and 84.56% in Syria?! --> in some countries.<!--e.g. in Turkmenistan at 61.86%--><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/turkmenistan/#monthly-201810-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Turkmenistan|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/turkmenistan/#quarterly-201804-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Turkmenistan|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref> <!--now less than 50% in a number of countries such as India (Win10 has overtaken) and in China at 48.37%,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/china/#monthly-201803-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share China|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref> -->\n\n== Development history ==\nOriginally, a version of Windows codenamed \"Blackcomb\" was planned as the successor to [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] in 2000.

However, an interim, minor release, codenamed \"Longhorn,\" was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/24/gates_confirms_windows_longhorn|title=Gates confirms Windows Longhorn for 2003|last=Lettice|first=John|date=October 24, 2001|website=The Register|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb.
