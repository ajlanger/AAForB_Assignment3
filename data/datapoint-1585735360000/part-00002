He was later enrolled at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he graduated in 1869. Halsted entered [[Yale College]] after a year of studying at home.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> At Yale, Halsted was captain of the football team, played baseball and rowed on the crew team, but his academic achievements were below average.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> One of his social setbacks was in his senior year when he wasn't accepted into the prestigious Skull and Bones Secret Society.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> At the end of his senior year at Yale, a newfound interest in medicine seemed to arise.

He complained about his memory not working correctly among other things so during the summer of his second year he went to Block Island in Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Here, he studied while participating in activities like fishing and sailing.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He then took a competitive exam to apply for an internship at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in New York even though this program was only open to students with medical degrees.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted did very well on the exam and was awarded the internship for House Surgeon at Bellevue where he remained for a year.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" />\n\nHalsted spent most of his internship in the medical wards but also helped with some surgical operations.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The conditions in the hospital were very unsanitary; bleeding patients was a common practice during this time, and surgical tools weren't as well cared for as they are modernly.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Interns ran around the hospital with buckets full of pus from the patients.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> During the internship, Halsted was introduced to the idea of antiseptic through physicians using Joseph Lister's technique created in 1867.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> This sparked an interest in Halsted, and he helped with the issue of infections at Bellevue during the rest of the internship.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> He ended his academic career in the top ten of his medical school class. He then participated in a competition that placed him at the top of his class.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He graduated in 1877 with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree.<ref>{{cite news|title=William Stewart Halsted|work=[[Annals of Surgery]]|pmc = 1448951}}</ref>\n\n== Medical career ==\nAfter graduation, Halsted joined the [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital]] as house physician in April 1878, where he introduced the hospital chart which tracks the patient's temperature, pulse and respiration. It was at New York Hospital that Halsted met the pathologist [[William H. Welch]], who would become his closest friend. He left New York Hospital in October 1878.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" />\n\nHalsted had exhausted all of the medical training opportunities the United States had to offer in his position, for there was no program to train recent medical school graduates for a career in medicine at this time.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted then went to Europe to study under the tutelage of several prominent surgeons and scientists, including [[Edoardo Bassini]], [[Ernst von Bergmann]], [[Theodor Billroth]], [[Heinrich Braun]], [[Hans Chiari]], [[Friedrich von Esmarch]], [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]], [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]], [[Max Schede]], [[Adolph St\u00f6hr]], [[Richard von Volkmann]], [[Anton W\u00f6lfler]], [[Emil Zuckerkandl]].<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> He became especially close to Anton Woelfler among others which gave him unlimited access to resources.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> The relationships Halsted forged with these future leaders in their fields would last a lifetime.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> During this time in Europe, cancer was just starting to be studied more widely, making the timing of his arrival ideal.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> This experience inspired him with multiple new medical ideas and practices that he would contribute to in the United States.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted returned to New York in 1880 and for the next six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. Like when Halsted visited Europe, it was an opportune time for Halsted's involvement because surgery was on the brink of various important discoveries.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He operated at multiple hospitals including the Chambers Street Hospital, College of Physicians and Surgeons where he was Assistant Demonstrator in Anatomy, Charity Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and [[Mount Sinai West]] (formerly Roosevelt Hospital) where he was a visiting physician at all three, and Emigrant Hospital where he was Surgeon-in-Chief.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> At Bellevue Hospital, he convinced the hospital to erect a tent that was used as his surgical area where he could practice the idea of antiseptic surgery. This project cost $10,000 at the time.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted also started teaching, but he greatly strayed from classical teaching methods. He reformed the classroom by creating a more hands-on experience coupled with theory for his students who were generally at the top of their classes.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher due to this. In 1882 he performed one of the first [[gallbladder]] operations in the United States, a [[cholecystotomy]] performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2&nbsp;am in which he removed seven gallstones.<ref name=\"Ember Gerald\">{{Cite journal|last=Gerald|first=Ember|title=Genius on the Edge: The Bizarre Double Life of Dr. William Stewart halsted|url=http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.28.0a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&S=BHNAFPLCFLDDNCOLNCFKMBMCHPCHAA00&returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.22.23%257c0%257c00000542-201106000-00046%26S%3dBHNAFPLCFLDDNCOLNCFKMBMCHPCHAA00&directlink=http%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCMCMBOLFL00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv023%2f00000542%2f00000542-201106000-00046.pdf&filename=Genius+on+the+Edge%3a+The+Bizarre+Double+Life+of+Dr.+William+Stewart+Halsted.&pdf_key=FPDDNCMCMBOLFL00&pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00000542/00000542-201106000-00046|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=114|issue=6|pages=1496\u20131497|via=|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e318216e9fa|year=2011|pmc=2898614}}</ref> His mother completely recovered.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted also performed one of the first emergency blood transfusions in the United States.<ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth.

Halsted and Dr. Richard Hall were the only colleagues who became addicted that would survive their cocaine problems.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted maintained an active career while dealing with his addiction for five years. Although, there were some clues to his condition during this time.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted published an article in 1885 in the ''New York Medical Journal'', and it was incoherent. This showcased what state Halsted was in with his addiction to cocaine.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /><ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> His close friend [[Harvey Firestone]] recognized the gravity of the situation, and arranged for Halsted to be abducted and put aboard a steamer headed for Europe.  In the two weeks it took to complete the voyage, Halsted underwent an early, crude form of detoxification.  Upon his return to the United States he became addicted again, and was sent to [[Butler Hospital|Butler Sanatorium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where they attempted to cure his cocaine addiction with morphine. He was there for seven months.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Even though he remained dependent upon morphine for the remainder of his life, he continued his career as a pioneering surgeon; many of his innovations remain standard operating room procedures.<ref>Imber, G. ''Genius on the Edge: The Bizarre Double Life of Dr. William Stewart Halsted''.  Kaplan Publishing (2010), pp. 138-43.</ref> However, his addiction to cocaine ended his medical career in New York City.<ref name=\"Peter Olch\" />\n[[File:Four doctors 1907.jpg|thumb|The four doctors: Osler, Halsted, Welch, and Kelly]]\nFollowing his discharge from Butler in 1886, Halsted moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] to join his friend William Welch in organizing and launching the new [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Halsted began working in Welch's experimental laboratory, and he presented a paper at Harvard Medical School. Although, soon after, he was readmitted to Butler Hospital and remained there for nine months. He returned to Baltimore thereafter.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> When Johns Hopkins University Hospital opened in May 1889, he became Head of the Outpatient Department, acting Surgeon to the Hospital, and Associate Professor of Surgery after being recommended by Welch when the first choice for the position fell through. These lesser positions alluded to the fact that the administration was still worried about Halsted's past cocaine addiction. In 1890, he was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief of the hospital.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> In 1892, Halsted joined Welch, [[William Osler]], and [[Howard Kelly]] in founding the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], and was appointed its first Professor of Surgery.<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 162-4.</ref> Although, compared to his teaching in New York, Halsted's teaching was declining. He would pay attention to specific students and ignore the rest. But, he would also give certain residents that worked under him unprecedented learning experiences because of the amount of responsibility he awarded them.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> During these years at Johns Hopkins, he is credited with multiple achievements in the surgical world.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" />\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nHalsted was credited with starting the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States at Johns Hopkins. He based this mainly on the ideas that he obtained in Europe, especially those of the Germans, Austrians, and Swiss. This was the foundation for the residency training programs in place today.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The program began with an internship of undefined length (individuals advanced once Halsted believed they were ready for the next level of training), followed by six years as an assistant resident, and then two years as house surgeon. This program was also developed to create role models and teachers for the next generation of surgeons.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted trained many of the prominent academic surgeons of the time, including [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and [[Walter Dandy]], founders of the surgical subspecialty of [[neurosurgery]]; and [[Hugh H. Young]], a founder of the specialty of [[urology]].<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 183-5.</ref> His methods of training surgeons spread, first to the rest of Baltimore and then throughout the United States.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Many prominent figures in medical surgery were affected and influenced by his new system of training, and it has had a profound impact on American medicine.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" />\n[[File:William Stewart Halsted, Surgical papers Wellcome L0004968.jpg|thumb|Radical mastectomy]]\nHalsted held the belief that cancers spread through the bloodstream, which led him to think that sufficient local removal of the tumor would cure the cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/history-of-cancer/cancer-treatment-surgery.html}}</ref> This belief led him to perform  the first [[radical mastectomy]] for breast cancer in the U.S. at [[Roosevelt Hospital]] in New York in 1882;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1u4x_iGiHNEC&pg=PA721# ''The Breast: Comprehensive Management of Benign and Malignant Diseases, Volume 2'' by Kirby I.

Peyrhile, \"Dissertatio academica de cancro,\" The Lyon Academy, (1773)</ref> Halsted had observed a German surgeon perform increasingly aggressive surgeries to remove cancerous tumors from the breast, but the patients still relapsed even with this more aggressive surgery.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> An English surgeon, Charles Moore, believed that even more breast tissue should be removed and doctors who were trying to save women from disfigurement were doing them a disservice.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted took this to the next level, eventually resorting to removing the pectoralis major, lymph nodes near the collar bone, and lymph nodes near the armpit.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Some surgeons in Europe even removed ribs from women with breast cancer. This caused great disfigurement of the women operated on.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted presented his findings at the [[American Surgical Association]] conference in New Orleans in 1898, concluding that the procedure significantly decreased the percentage of local reoccurrence.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> He also presented more findings in 1907, showing the same results.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Although, the radical mastectomy throughout the years has come under fire. It is now known that survival from breast cancer is more closely related to how much the cancer has spread before surgery than how much is removed during surgery.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted created multiple techniques for surgery so damage to tissues and blood supply would be minimized. Some of these new advances included different types of forceps, sutures, and ligatures.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> He was also the first to introduce rubber gloves into the operating room for surgery in 1889, drastically increasing the sanitization of operations.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> Although, this wasn't originally championed for sanitary reasons.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" /> The main reason for the introduction of these rubber gloves was to protect the hands of his scrub nurse, [[Caroline Hampton]]. She was allergic to the antiseptic so Halsted facilitated an arrangement with [[Goodyear Rubber Company]] to make rubber gloves. Caroline Hampton would later become his wife.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" />\n\nHe is also known for many other medical and surgical achievements. Besides working on breast cancer, Halsted also contributed to the surgical treatment for other diseases including vascular aneurysm, inguinal hernia, and a certain kind of primary carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> In addition, he helped develop anesthesia, an integral part of modern surgery.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> As one of the first proponents of [[hemostasis]] and investigators of [[wound healing]], Halsted pioneered [[Halsted's principles]], modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, exact approximation of tissue in wound closures without excessive tightness, and gentle handling of tissues.\n\nOther achievements included the introduction of latex surgical glove and advances in [[thyroid]], [[biliary tract]], [[hernia]],<ref name=\"Halsted1893\">{{cite journal|last=Halsted|first=WS|title=The radical cure of inguinal hernia in the male|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|volume=17|issue=5|pages=542\u201356|year=1893|pmc=1492972|pmid=17859917}}</ref> intestinal and arterial [[aneurysm]] surgery.\n\n[[H.L. Mencken]] considered Halsted the greatest physician of the whole Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken's praise of his achievements when he reviewed [[William George MacCallum|Dr. MacCallum]]'s 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. \"His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, he was the first to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. [[William James Mayo|Dr. William Mayo]], one of the cofounders of the [[Mayo Clinic]], once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Markel|first1=Howard|title=An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmond Freud, William Halstead, and the Miracle Drug, Cocaine|date=July 19, 2011|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1400078790|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189 189]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189}}</ref> Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of [[Ambroise Par\u00e9]]: 'God cured him; I assisted.'

He left New York Hospital in October 1878.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" />\n\nHalsted had exhausted all of the medical training opportunities the United States had to offer in his position, for there was no program to train recent medical school graduates for a career in medicine at this time.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted then went to Europe to study under the tutelage of several prominent surgeons and scientists, including [[Edoardo Bassini]], [[Ernst von Bergmann]], [[Theodor Billroth]], [[Heinrich Braun]], [[Hans Chiari]], [[Friedrich von Esmarch]], [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]], [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]], [[Max Schede]], [[Adolph St\u00f6hr]], [[Richard von Volkmann]], [[Anton W\u00f6lfler]], [[Emil Zuckerkandl]].<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> He became especially close to Anton Woelfler among others which gave him unlimited access to resources.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> The relationships Halsted forged with these future leaders in their fields would last a lifetime.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> During this time in Europe, cancer was just starting to be studied more widely, making the timing of his arrival ideal.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> This experience inspired him with multiple new medical ideas and practices that he would contribute to in the United States.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted returned to New York in 1880 and for the next six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. Like when Halsted visited Europe, it was an opportune time for Halsted's involvement because surgery was on the brink of various important discoveries.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He operated at multiple hospitals including the Chambers Street Hospital, College of Physicians and Surgeons where he was Assistant Demonstrator in Anatomy, Charity Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and [[Mount Sinai West]] (formerly Roosevelt Hospital) where he was a visiting physician at all three, and Emigrant Hospital where he was Surgeon-in-Chief.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> At Bellevue Hospital, he convinced the hospital to erect a tent that was used as his surgical area where he could practice the idea of antiseptic surgery. This project cost $10,000 at the time.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted also started teaching, but he greatly strayed from classical teaching methods. He reformed the classroom by creating a more hands-on experience coupled with theory for his students who were generally at the top of their classes.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher due to this. In 1882 he performed one of the first [[gallbladder]] operations in the United States, a [[cholecystotomy]] performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2&nbsp;am in which he removed seven gallstones.<ref name=\"Ember Gerald\">{{Cite journal|last=Gerald|first=Ember|title=Genius on the Edge: The Bizarre Double Life of Dr. William Stewart halsted|url=http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.28.0a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&S=BHNAFPLCFLDDNCOLNCFKMBMCHPCHAA00&returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.22.23%257c0%257c00000542-201106000-00046%26S%3dBHNAFPLCFLDDNCOLNCFKMBMCHPCHAA00&directlink=http%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCMCMBOLFL00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv023%2f00000542%2f00000542-201106000-00046.pdf&filename=Genius+on+the+Edge%3a+The+Bizarre+Double+Life+of+Dr.+William+Stewart+Halsted.&pdf_key=FPDDNCMCMBOLFL00&pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00000542/00000542-201106000-00046|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=114|issue=6|pages=1496\u20131497|via=|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e318216e9fa|year=2011|pmc=2898614}}</ref> His mother completely recovered.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted also performed one of the first emergency blood transfusions in the United States.<ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth.

Halsted and Dr. Richard Hall were the only colleagues who became addicted that would survive their cocaine problems.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted maintained an active career while dealing with his addiction for five years. Although, there were some clues to his condition during this time.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted published an article in 1885 in the ''New York Medical Journal'', and it was incoherent. This showcased what state Halsted was in with his addiction to cocaine.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /><ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> His close friend [[Harvey Firestone]] recognized the gravity of the situation, and arranged for Halsted to be abducted and put aboard a steamer headed for Europe.  In the two weeks it took to complete the voyage, Halsted underwent an early, crude form of detoxification.  Upon his return to the United States he became addicted again, and was sent to [[Butler Hospital|Butler Sanatorium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where they attempted to cure his cocaine addiction with morphine. He was there for seven months.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Even though he remained dependent upon morphine for the remainder of his life, he continued his career as a pioneering surgeon; many of his innovations remain standard operating room procedures.<ref>Imber, G.

Halsted began working in Welch's experimental laboratory, and he presented a paper at Harvard Medical School. Although, soon after, he was readmitted to Butler Hospital and remained there for nine months. He returned to Baltimore thereafter.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> When Johns Hopkins University Hospital opened in May 1889, he became Head of the Outpatient Department, acting Surgeon to the Hospital, and Associate Professor of Surgery after being recommended by Welch when the first choice for the position fell through. These lesser positions alluded to the fact that the administration was still worried about Halsted's past cocaine addiction. In 1890, he was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief of the hospital.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> In 1892, Halsted joined Welch, [[William Osler]], and [[Howard Kelly]] in founding the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], and was appointed its first Professor of Surgery.<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 162-4.</ref> Although, compared to his teaching in New York, Halsted's teaching was declining. He would pay attention to specific students and ignore the rest. But, he would also give certain residents that worked under him unprecedented learning experiences because of the amount of responsibility he awarded them.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> During these years at Johns Hopkins, he is credited with multiple achievements in the surgical world.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" />\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nHalsted was credited with starting the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States at Johns Hopkins. He based this mainly on the ideas that he obtained in Europe, especially those of the Germans, Austrians, and Swiss. This was the foundation for the residency training programs in place today.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The program began with an internship of undefined length (individuals advanced once Halsted believed they were ready for the next level of training), followed by six years as an assistant resident, and then two years as house surgeon. This program was also developed to create role models and teachers for the next generation of surgeons.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted trained many of the prominent academic surgeons of the time, including [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and [[Walter Dandy]], founders of the surgical subspecialty of [[neurosurgery]]; and [[Hugh H. Young]], a founder of the specialty of [[urology]].<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 183-5.</ref> His methods of training surgeons spread, first to the rest of Baltimore and then throughout the United States.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Many prominent figures in medical surgery were affected and influenced by his new system of training, and it has had a profound impact on American medicine.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" />\n[[File:William Stewart Halsted, Surgical papers Wellcome L0004968.jpg|thumb|Radical mastectomy]]\nHalsted held the belief that cancers spread through the bloodstream, which led him to think that sufficient local removal of the tumor would cure the cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/history-of-cancer/cancer-treatment-surgery.html}}</ref> This belief led him to perform  the first [[radical mastectomy]] for breast cancer in the U.S. at [[Roosevelt Hospital]] in New York in 1882;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1u4x_iGiHNEC&pg=PA721# ''The Breast: Comprehensive Management of Benign and Malignant Diseases, Volume 2'' by Kirby I.

This caused great disfigurement of the women operated on.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted presented his findings at the [[American Surgical Association]] conference in New Orleans in 1898, concluding that the procedure significantly decreased the percentage of local reoccurrence.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> He also presented more findings in 1907, showing the same results.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Although, the radical mastectomy throughout the years has come under fire. It is now known that survival from breast cancer is more closely related to how much the cancer has spread before surgery than how much is removed during surgery.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted created multiple techniques for surgery so damage to tissues and blood supply would be minimized. Some of these new advances included different types of forceps, sutures, and ligatures.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> He was also the first to introduce rubber gloves into the operating room for surgery in 1889, drastically increasing the sanitization of operations.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> Although, this wasn't originally championed for sanitary reasons.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" /> The main reason for the introduction of these rubber gloves was to protect the hands of his scrub nurse, [[Caroline Hampton]]. She was allergic to the antiseptic so Halsted facilitated an arrangement with [[Goodyear Rubber Company]] to make rubber gloves. Caroline Hampton would later become his wife.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" />\n\nHe is also known for many other medical and surgical achievements. Besides working on breast cancer, Halsted also contributed to the surgical treatment for other diseases including vascular aneurysm, inguinal hernia, and a certain kind of primary carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> In addition, he helped develop anesthesia, an integral part of modern surgery.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> As one of the first proponents of [[hemostasis]] and investigators of [[wound healing]], Halsted pioneered [[Halstead's principles|Halsted's principles]], modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, exact approximation of tissue in wound closures without excessive tightness, and gentle handling of tissues.\n\nOther achievements included the introduction of latex surgical glove and advances in [[thyroid]], [[biliary tract]], [[hernia]],<ref name=\"Halsted1893\">{{cite journal|last=Halsted|first=WS|title=The radical cure of inguinal hernia in the male|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|volume=17|issue=5|pages=542\u201356|year=1893|pmc=1492972|pmid=17859917}}</ref> intestinal and arterial [[aneurysm]] surgery.\n\n[[H.L. Mencken]] considered Halsted the greatest physician of the whole Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken's praise of his achievements when he reviewed [[William George MacCallum|Dr. MacCallum]]'s 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. \"His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, he was the first to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. [[William James Mayo|Dr. William Mayo]], one of the cofounders of the [[Mayo Clinic]], once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Markel|first1=Howard|title=An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmond Freud, William Halstead, and the Miracle Drug, Cocaine|date=July 19, 2011|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1400078790|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189 189]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189}}</ref> Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of [[Ambroise Par\u00e9]]: 'God cured him; I assisted.'
