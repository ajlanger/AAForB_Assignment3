The charter was granted by [[James I]]. The school moved to its current site in [[Croydon]] in 1975. A school for girls, [[Mary Datchelor Girl's School]], was established in Camberwell in 1877. It was built on two houses at 15 and 17 Grove Lane, the location of a former manor house. All except one of its 30 pupils came from the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London. The funding for the school came from a bequest from Mary Datchelor, who died childless. Proceeds of a property in [[Threadneedle Street]] used as a coffee-house were used to pay for apprenticeships for the poor boys of the parish, but as demographics in the City changed, it was decided to set up a school. By the 1970s, the school was receiving funding from the [[Clothworkers' Company]] and the [[Inner London Education Authority]] funded teaching posts. The school came under pressure from ILEA to become co-educational and comprehensive. Faced with this choice or becoming fully private, the school's governors instead decided to close in 1981. The school buildings were later used as offices for the charity [[Save the Children]] but have now been converted to flats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.southwark.gov.uk/objects/317/mary-datchelor-school-camberwell-grove;jsessionid=BB9D9B6B2FAF4191B8CFC96178470121|title=Mary Datchelor School, Camberwell Grove \u2013 Works \u2013 Southwark Heritage|website=heritage.southwark.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F100193|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk/mary-datchelor-school/4593161554|title=Mary Datchelor School \u2013 Exploring Southwark|website=www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk}}</ref>[[Camberwell Collegiate School]]\nwas an independent school located on the eastern side of Camberwell Grove, directly opposite the Grove Chapel.

The charter was granted by [[James I]]. The school moved to its current site in [[Croydon]] in 1975. A school for girls, [[Mary Datchelor Girl's School]], was established in Camberwell in 1877. It was built on two houses at 15 and 17 Grove Lane, the location of a former manor house. All except one of its 30 pupils came from the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London. The funding for the school came from a bequest from Mary Datchelor, who died childless. Proceeds of a property in [[Threadneedle Street]] used as a coffee-house were used to pay for apprenticeships for the poor boys of the parish, but as demographics in the City changed, it was decided to set up a school. By the 1970s, the school was receiving funding from the [[Clothworkers' Company]] and the [[Inner London Education Authority]] funded teaching posts. The school came under pressure from ILEA to become co-educational and comprehensive. Faced with this choice or becoming fully private, the school's governors instead decided to close in 1981. The school buildings were later used as offices for the charity [[Save the Children]] but have now been converted to flats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.southwark.gov.uk/objects/317/mary-datchelor-school-camberwell-grove;jsessionid=BB9D9B6B2FAF4191B8CFC96178470121|title=Mary Datchelor School, Camberwell Grove \u2013 Works \u2013 Southwark Heritage|website=heritage.southwark.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F100193|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk/mary-datchelor-school/4593161554|title=Mary Datchelor School \u2013 Exploring Southwark|website=www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk}}</ref>[[Camberwell Collegiate School]]\nwas an independent school located on the eastern side of Camberwell Grove, directly opposite the Grove Chapel.
