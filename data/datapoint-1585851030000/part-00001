Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters.

Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.

According to Barakat's account, Khaled Mustafa Qurmo and Khaled Abdel Majid Qurmo, two cousins, were driving him home in Barisha on October 26 when helicopters fired on their white van. All three exited the vehicle, but one fell, his legs filled with [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]. A follow-up strike targeted the group again, killing the two cousins and blowing off a chunk of Barakat's right arm. The cousins died of shrapnel wounds to the chest, according to autopsy reports by a Syrian doctor with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, an international medical group. Several relatives said the cousins operated a van service and had no connection to ISIL or any armed group; Barakat said the van carried no weapons.

Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid.<ref name=nprciv/>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA November 6, 2019 [[Brookings Institution]] analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \"power and resolve\" in the [[War on Terror]], remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence collection]], international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.
