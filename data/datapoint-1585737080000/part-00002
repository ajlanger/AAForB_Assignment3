The show aired from September 10, 2005 to October 14, 2006. In 2008, after a hiatus, the show was renewed for season 2. The show is about four female teenagers who run their own [[teen magazine]].\n\nThe voice actors are [[Olivia Hack]], [[Soleil Moon Frye]], [[Tia Mowry]], [[Dionne Quan]], [[Wendie Malick]], [[Lacey Chabert]], and [[Kaley Cuoco]]. In season 2, not only the voice actors were different, but replaced with Canadian voice actors as well, [[Britt McKillip]], [[Britt Irvin]], Dorla Bell, [[Maryke Hendrikse]], [[Ellie Harvie]], [[Kelly Sheridan]], and [[Ashleigh Ball]] all star in season 2. Other Bratz shows such as ''[[Bratzillaz (web series)|Bratzillaz]]'' and ''[[Bratz: C.I.Y. Shoppe Webseries]]'' have a different plot and they serve as reboots. ''Bratz'' also had a lot of films. Some of them had the Bratz Babyz and Bratz Kidz characters or the Bratz in their original style. They featured different voice actors for both seasons. The show also spawned video games based on the films.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the fictional city of Stylesville, the show revolves around four teenagers (Cloe, Jade, Sasha, Yasmin) running their own [[teen magazine]], titled \"Bratz\", while struggling school life at Stiles High School. Their rival magazine is \"Your Thing\", owned and run by the proud and demanding self-proclaimed \"Reigning Queen of Fashion\" Burdine Maxwell, and her mean identical twin interns Kirstee and Kaycee, known infamously as \"the Tweevils\". Accompanied by their friends Dylan, Cameron and Eitan, the girls' issues are exploited throughout the series, both in and outside of Stylesville.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n====Bratz Magazine====\n'''Cloe''' (Angel) (voiced by [[Olivia Hack]] in season 1; [[Britt McKillip]] in season 2): Cloe is charge of the \"Dear Cloe\" column in the magazine, where readers write to her for teen advice. She is characterised by her romantic, dreamy and outgoing attitude, as well as her highly dramatic tendencies, hence specialising in acting and debating. Although she enjoys shopping and fashion, she plays in a tomboy side through skateboarding and riding a motorcycle. Her love interest is Cameron.\n\n'''Sasha''' (Bunny Boo) (voiced by [[Tia Mowry]] in season 1; Dorla Bell in season 2): Sasha is the music editor of the group and specializes in hip-hop dancing and creating songs. She is described by her bold and sassy attitude, although this can sometimes backfire and make her become perfectionistic and controlling.

She is, in reality, unintentionally responsible for the creation of Bratz magazine after firing Jade unreasonably during the latter's internship. Quick to anger, impatient and bossy, she proclaims herself the \"Reigning Queen of Fashion\", choosing to uphold this title by dressing constantly in same pink suits and owning over 50 pairs of old-fashioned pink pumps.

Due to being older and more intelligent she tends to lead and facilitate the twins' various operations. \n\n'''Kaycee''' (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in season 1; [[Kelly Sheridan]] in season 2): Kaycee is the youngest of the Tweevils who does her bun with a ribbon-shaped hair tie and has a [[adhesive bandage]] on her nose which, according to Sasha, was the result of three nose jobs following accidents involving it.

Her hit singles are \"Everything\", \"My Attitude\", and \"Shining Like Real Diamondz\". She is a R&B singer, has a  moon tattoo on the back of her hand and has two platinum CDs. Once, Alonc\u00e9 went to [[London]] to have an interview with Sasha. The Bratz performed a show for her and said \"she loved the show\". Cree Summer (best known for voicing Susie Carmichael in ''[[Rugrats]]'') voices Alonc\u00e9.
