It is believed that Salinas originally  met Gerard in 1983 at the [[Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico]], where he was teaching at the time, though that story remains unconfirmed.<ref name=cg/> Gerard later worked as a technical secretary for the Economic Cabinet of the Salinas administration.<ref name=cg/> The couple had three children.

It was a key cabinet position since Mexico was in dire financial circumstances following the presidency of [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]], who as a desperate measure had nationalized the banks in Mexico and expropriated dollar-denominated savings accounts. The country held no hard currency reserves, exhaustion of foreign credit, and soaring interest rates. the Ministries of Finance and Planning and Budget became the most powerful positions to deal with the economic crisis. In the cabinet, Salinas's main rival was [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]], Minister of Finance.  In the internecine politics that would decide who would succeed De la Madrid as president, Salinas sought to destroy the reputation of Silva Herzog. Another key figure in the cabinet was [[Manuel Bartlett]], Minister of the Interior, with whom Salinas forged a non-compete alliance. Salinas also forged other alliances within the circles of power and did not directly compete with De la Madrid for public attention. Silva Herzog made missteps in his ministry, which Salinas capitalized on, forcing his resignation.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 63-68</ref>\n\n==Presidential election 1988==\n{{Main|1988 Mexican general election}}\n\n\"Not in their worst nightmares could the lords of the PRI have imagined what would happen to them on the sixth of July 1988. As they had done six years before, the electorate came out to vote, but not in support of the official candidate. They came to the voting booths to punish him.\"<ref>[[Enrique Krauze]], ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 770.</ref>  Carlos Salinas had become presidential candidate in a difficult time for the PRI which for the first time was faced by significant opposition from the left ([[National Democratic Front (Mexico)|National Democratic Front]]) and from the right ([[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], PAN). The candidate of the PAN was [[Manuel Clouthier]].\n\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas Sol\u00f3rzano]], son of President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], registered as an opposing candidate from a left-wing coalition called ''Frente Democr\u00e1tico Nacional''. He rapidly became a popular figure, and became the first opposing candidate to fill the ''[[Z\u00f3calo]]'' with sympathizers and to seriously threaten the PRI, which had won all presidential elections since its inception in 1929. The Ministry of the Interior ([[Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n]]), through its Federal Electoral Commission, was the institution in charge of the electoral process, and installed a modern computing system to count the votes. On election day July 6, 1988, the system \"crashed\", and when it was finally restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner. Even though the elections are extremely controversial, and some maintain that Salinas won legally, the expression ''se cay\u00f3 el sistema'' (\"the system crashed\") became a colloquial euphemism for electoral fraud. As one observer put it, \"For the ordinary citizen, it was not the computer network but the Mexican political system that had crashed.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. p. 770.</ref>\n\nThe process involved two suspicious shutdowns of the computer system used to keep track of the number of votes.<ref name=\"july6book\">{{cite book|last=Vald\u00e9s|first=Leonardo|author2=Piekarewicz Sigal, Mina|title=M\u00e9xico, el 6 de julio de 1988 : segundo informe sobre la democracia|editor=Gonz\u00e1lez Casanova, Pablo |publisher=Siglo Vientiuno Editores : Centro de Investigaciones Interdisciplinarias en Humanidades, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico|location=Mexico City|year=1990|chapter=La organizaci\u00f3n de las elecciones|isbn=978-968-23-1651-7 |oclc=23953244 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTdvt22y08QC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76|accessdate=2009-04-19|language=Spanish}}</ref> Suspicions later grew as [[Congress of the Union|Congress]] voted (with support from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Revolutionary Institutional]] and [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action]] parties)<ref name=\"aguayo-boletas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sergioaguayo.org/articulos/2008/ART08-01-16.pdf |title=Las boletas |last=Aguayo Quezada |first=Sergio |date=2008-01-16 |publisher=Reforma |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-04-19 |quote=El 88 termin\u00f3 siendo un detonante de la transici\u00f3n y cal\u00f3 muy hondo la ignominiosa quema de las boletas electorales de 1988 aprobada por el PRI y el PAN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003064650/http://www.sergioaguayo.org/articulos/2008/ART08-01-16.pdf |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> to destroy without opening the electoral documentation.

Vargas 1998\"/>\n\n====First steps====\nImmediately upon his inauguration, he arrested prominent union leaders, many of whom were his opponents in the PRI, among other measures to demonstrate his determination to set his own course. His government privatized state-run companies, including Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, sold to PRI-insider [[Carlos Slim]], as well as re-privatizing banks that President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] had nationalized at the end of his term. The funds from these sales of state assets helped pay off Mexico's internal debt.  However, there were also bailouts for banks and the Mexican toll roads that became scandals.<ref>Bussey, \"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\", p. 1331</ref>\n\n====Economic policy====\nSalinas continued with the [[neoliberal]] economic policy of his predecessor [[Miguel de la Madrid]] and converted Mexico into a regulatory state.<ref>Remonda Bensabat Kleinberg,  \"Strategic Alliances: State\u2010Business Relations in Mexico Under Neo\u2010Liberalism and Crisis.\" ''Bulletin of Latin American Research'' 18.1 (1999): 71-87.</ref> During his presidential term,  he aggressively privatized hundreds of state-run companies, including telecommunications, steel, and mining.

Shortly after leaving office, due to the so-called [[Mexican peso crisis|December Mistake]], inflation rose again to 51%.\n\nDuring his term, the peso devalued from 2.65 MXP to 3.60 [[MXN]] per U.S. dollar by November 30, 1994, the last day of his term; thus the peso devalued far less than it had in the two previous terms. (The peso was later devalued from 4 per dollar to 7.2 in a single week due to the \"December Mistake.\")\n\n====Poverty alleviation====\nSalinas established the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL), a [[Social Welfare in Mexico|social welfare program]], as a way to directly aid poor Mexicans, but also create a network of support for Salinas.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"Social spending and political support: The\" lessons\" of the National Solidarity Program in Mexico.\" Comparative Politics (1996): 151-177.</ref>  It was his first official act as president.  The program channeled public funds, which the administration said came largely from privatization of  state-owned companies, into impoverished areas to improve roads, the electrical grid, schools, and clinics in order to raise levels of education and health and link remote areas, with lack of oversight in its spending.<ref>Paul Lawrence Haber, \"Neoliberalism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

Salinas's Harvard doctoral dissertation had examined the relationship between social programs and political support for the government. Given the Salinas's questionable legitimacy as the winner of the 1988 election, PRONASOL was seen as a way for Salinas to deliver immediate benefits to the poor and avert their turning to other political parties or worse. It did not prioritize funding for Mexico's poorest states, but rather to states with middle-income populations where elections were most contested and where the PRI had lost. Politically, the program sought to undermine the appeal of leftists, especially [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]].<ref>Haber, \"Neoliberalism\", p. 1016.</ref> In Chiapas, PRONASOL channeled increased funds in 1993 and 1994, but it did not prevent the [[Zapatista uprising]], which showed that the program had only a limited impact.<ref>Jonathan Fox, \"Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, (PRONASOL)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1360-1362</ref><ref>Cornelius, Wayne, Ann Craig, and Jonathan Fox, eds.

In the 1980s, the church saw electoral participation reform and fighting electoral fraud as an issue. Sometime during the presidential campaign, the PRI had indicated to the Church that a Salinas victory would be beneficial to the Church. It has been considered a quid pro quo agreement.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'', see esp. chapter 5, \"Salinismo, the Church, and Quid Pro Quo\".</ref>\nA delegation of the leadership of the episcopal hierarchy attended the inauguration of Salinas on December 1, 1988.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'' p. 71-72.</ref> After the 1988 election the Mexican bishops did not make public statements about the election results. Behind the scenes the apostolic delegate to Mexico, the Vatican's representative, Mexican bishops, and government officials had a series of secret meetings that hammered out the outlines of a new Church-State relationship. In his inaugural address, Salinas de Gortari announced a program to \"modernize\" Mexico via structural transformation. \"The modern state is a state which ... maintains transparency and updates its relation with political parties, entrepreneurial groups, and the church.\"<ref>Salinas, quoted in Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach.\" ''Journal of Church & State'', Autumn 1993, vol. 35.

A major change was the creation of the [[Instituto Nacional Electoral|Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) in October 1990, taking elections out of the hands of the Ministry of the Interior to create an independent entity.\n\nThe [[1994 Mexican general election|1994 elections]] were the first to have international observers, and were considered, at that time, the fairest elections in the century, although not free of controversy.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/world/mexico-invites-un-to-attend-election-to-observe-the-observers.html |title= Mexico Invites U.N. to Attend Election to Observe the Observers|author= Tim Golden|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date = May 13, 1994}}</ref>  For the first time, the PRI lost its two-thirds majority in Congress, which is necessary to conduct constitutional reforms.<ref name=\"Rivera Ayala 2008 388\">{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=388}}</ref>\n\n====Human rights====\nIn 1990, the [[National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)|National Human Rights Commission]] (''Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos'') was created.<ref name=\"Delgado de Cant\u00fa 2003 484\">{{cite book|last=Delgado de Cant\u00fa|first=Gloria M.|title=M\u00e9xico, estructuras pol\u00edtica, econ\u00f3mica y social|year=2003|publisher=Pearson Educaci\u00f3n|pages=484}}</ref>  Initially a government agency, it became a separate entity,\n\n====Education====\nIn 1992, Salinas and his Secretary of Education, [[Ernesto Zedillo]] introduced new compulsory history texts in Mexican schools, part of the Mexican Free-Textbook Program. Authored by [[:es:Enrique Florescano|Enrique Florescano]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Aguilar Cam\u00edn]], the new textbooks set off a storm of controversy. Shifts in emphasis concerned the [[Porfiriato]] and the role of foreign investment, [[Emiliano Zapata]], lauding him as a hero despite his having opposed every government in power; [[U.S.-Mexico relations]], avoiding negative treatment of the history; and the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]], treating it dispassionately.  The government was compelled to withdraw them in January 1993.  According to one assessment, \"While the 1992 textbook controversy disclosed new support for the regime from the right, it also revealed an erosion of support and discipline within officialdom.\"<ref>Dennis Gilbert, \"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\" ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' 13(2), summer 1997 p. 295.</ref>\n\n===North American Free Trade Agreement===\n{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}\n{{See also|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}\n[[File:Nafta.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Carlos Salinas (left), [[George H.&nbsp;W. Bush]], and [[Brian Mulroney]] during the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] Initialing Ceremony in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\n[[File:NAFTA logo.svg|thumb|250px|right|NAFTA logo]]\n\nThe centerpiece of Salinas's presidency was his successful negotiation with the U.S. and Canada to create the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which came into effect on 1 January 1994. The agreement was a reversal of Mexico's longstanding policies of economic nationalism and anti-Americanism and was intended to create a single market. Mexican proponents of NAFTA saw it in a way to secure markets for its exports and attract foreign investment, and create jobs, help the government to be able to service its foreign debt, and overall, promote economic recovery. In Mexico, the reversal was controversial, opposed by organized labor, many academics, and nongovernmental organizations.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1021-22.</ref>\n\n===Drug trafficking and corruption===\n{{Main|Mexican Drug War}}\nAn issue of importance both domestic and foreign policy is drug trafficking. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico was a transit country for [[cocaine]] produced in Colombia and destined for consumers in the United States. President De la Madrid considered drug trafficking a national security issue and devoted government funding to it. Salinas expanded this funding, but neither president stemmed the growth of trafficking and its impact on Mexico. Drug trafficking is highly lucrative for those involved with it, and Mexico's weak law enforcement and judicial system could not prevent the wide-scale involvement of Mexico's poorly-paid police from being corrupted. The Mexican military to a lesser extent was corrupted, along with politicians, and some journalists. Such corruption undermined the possibility of rule of law and it prevented Mexicans from having trust in the state.

Salinas also renegotiated Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, Salinas had traveled to Europe to attract non-North American capital investment, but dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc opened them to foreign investment; Mexico was less attractive to them and Salinas turned to North America.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\", p. 1021.</ref> Critics say that  NAFTA has had mixed results for Mexico: while there has been huge increase in commerce and foreign investment, this has not been at all the case for employment and salaries.<ref name=\"eluniversal.com.mx\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Mexico hosted the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a venue where the parties in the civil war in El Salvador signed an accord ending the long conflict.<ref>Diana Negroponte, \"Implementation of the Chapultepec Peace Accords\" in ''Seeking Peace in El Salvador: The Struggle to Reconstruct a Nation at the End of the Cold War''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan 2012</ref>\n\nMexico reestablished diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Moreover, Mexico became member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). The First [[Ibero-American Summit]] was held and the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a peace agreement for El Salvador, were signed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=393}}</ref>\n\nSalinas in 1991 visited United States to help convince the Illinois Governor, [[James R. Thompson]] to pardon four Mexican citizens from a quadruple murder known as the Milwaukee Ave Massacre, that took place in 1981 in Chicago, Illinois. With the help of Carlos Salinas de Gortari the four men, Joaquin Varela, Rogelio Arroyo, Ignacio Varela, and Isauro Sanchez, had their sentences commuted, later pardoned by Governor [[Jim Edgar]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==1994 Election year==\nAs the 1994 presidential election approached, Salinas had the crucial decision to designate the candidate for the PRI; that person had always gone on to win the presidential election. \"The shipwreck of the 1988 succession should have sufficed to teach Salinas to prevent another disaster from befalling the system he had inherited.\"<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 89.</ref> At the time Salinas made the choice, popularity and credibility was high over the course of his presidency,<ref>Villarreal, Andres. \u201cPublic Opinion of the Economy and the President among Mexico City Residents: The Salinas Sexenio.\u201d Latin American Research Review, vol. 34, no. 2, 1999, p. 131 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2503915 accessed 21 March 2019</ref> but a series of events in the final year of his presidency changed that.\n\n===Choosing the PRI Nominee===\n\nThe \"unveiling\" of the PRI candidate for the presidency was on 28 November 1993, with Salinas choosing [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]]. Those considered for the position were [[Manuel Camacho Solis|Manuel Camacho]] and Colosio, with earlier contenders, such as [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]] and [[Pedro Aspe]] being eliminated. Aspe, a graduate of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] had a high international profile, but was considered unlikely to actually attract voters.  The changed circumstances of the Mexican political system, as demonstrated by Salinas's own election to the presidency, meant that being designated the PRI did not guarantee election. Aspe was not a charismatic prospect as a candidate who could energize and charm voters.  With the potential that Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas was likely to run again for the presidency, the PRI needed to field someone who could garner votes.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 92-96.</ref>\n\n===Zapatista rebellion===\n{{Main|Zapatista Army of National Liberation}}\n[[File:Flag of the EZLN.jpg|thumb|Flag of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)]]\nThe uprising in Chiapas on 1 January 1994 coincided with the date that the NAFTA came into effect. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', EZLN) issued their first declaration from the state of [[Chiapas]] in southern Mexico. Salinas's immediate response was to find for a peaceful solution: offering pardon to deposed arms; ordering a cease fire; appointing a peace negotiator, and sending Mexican Congress a General Amnesty Law. Salinas's presidential successor took a harder line when he was inaugurated. But Salinas's more peaceful solution [[1995 Zapatista Crisis|Zapatista uprising]] was legal and politically pragmatic, likely saving many lives in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&article=12183|title=La \u00danica l\u00ednea es que no tenemos l\u00ednea|website=Enlineadirecta.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Buzos|website=Buzos.com.mx|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&rl=wh&#93; |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825194625/https://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958 |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Zapatista rebellion did not spread regionally or nationwide, but the fact that it happened and that international attention was drawn to this poor region of Mexico just as NAFTA was implemented meant that Salinas's careful plans for a peaceful political transition with his legacy intact were obliterated.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 106</ref> Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the government's peace mediator. For Salinas, this had political benefits, since Camacho, having been passed over as the PRI presidential candidate, could have bolted from the party. With this important appointment, he was in the public limelight again.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 107.</ref>\n\n===Assassination of Colosio and the new PRI Candidate===\n[[File:Luis Donaldo Colosio Los Pinos Mexico 2018.jpg|thumb|Bust of Colosio at Los Pinos]]\nA spectacular political event of 1994 was the assassination of Salinas's handpicked PRI presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] in March 1994, upending the already complex electoral situation with elections scheduled for August 1994. The Zapatista uprising had ruined Salinas's plans for a peaceful transition of Mexico in the elections.  There is evidence that Salinas and Colosio began to disagree, not unusual after the electoral transfer, but this occurred prior to it. His campaign languished with lack of funding, Colosio had problems getting media coverage, given the high-profile events in Chiapas. Salinas prevented Colosio from going to Chiapas, while the explanation that his presence there would complicate the situation. Increasingly there was the impression that Salinas would reverse his decision for Colosio, substituting someone else, perhaps [[Manuel Camacho]]. Camacho was a politically savvy former [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Head of Government of Mexico City]] as well as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas.  Salinas made a public statement on 17 January 1994, affirming his choice as candidate, but this was at the insistence of Colosio. Salinas extracted a pledge from Camacho that he had no designs on the presidency, which he renounced the day before Colosio's assassination in Tijuana 23 March 1994.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 108- 109</ref>  After a few days of weighing his options, Salinas chose Colosio's campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, former Minister of Education, as the new PRI candidate for the presidency. Zedillo had been Secretary of Education, a relatively unimportant ministry; he had resigned to run the campaign of Colosio. Zedillo had never held elective office, sharing that trait with De la Madrid and Salinas, but Zedillo was not otherwise experienced politically. He was perceived as a weak candidate. There are speculation that Salinas wished to perpetuate his power as [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] had in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], controlling successor presidents.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1641</ref>\n\n===1994 General Election===\n{{See|1994 Mexican general election}}\nAfter considering whether to postpone the general election scheduled for 21 August 1994, Salinas chose Zedillo to run as the PRI candidate for the presidency and the elections took place as scheduled. Voters came out in large numbers to choose between three main candidates, Zedillo for the PRI, C\u00e1rdenas for the Party of Democratic Revolution, and [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] for the PAN. Zedillo won a clear victory, in what were considered by foreign observers as free and fair. In results published by the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), Zedillo got 48.7%, Cevallos 25.9%, and C\u00e1rdenas 16.6%.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061115072642/http://www.ife.org.mx/documentos/RESELEC/nuevo_1994/pres_94/nac_edo/nac_pre_94.html accessed 25 March 2019</ref>\n\n===Another political assassination===\nFollowing the election in September 1994, Secretary General of the PRI [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], Salinas' former brother-in-law, was assassinated in downtown Mexico City in broad daylight. The murder was not solved during Salinas's presidency, even when [[:es:Mario Ruiz Massieu|Mario Ruiz Massieu]] (Francisco's brother) was the [[Attorney General of Mexico|attorney general]] and in charge of the investigation.\n\n===Economic issues===\nThe economic bubble gave Mexico a prosperity not seen in a generation. This period of rapid growth coupled with low inflation prompted some political thinkers and the media to state that Mexico was on the verge of becoming a \"First World nation\". In fact, it was the first of the \"newly industrialized nations\" to be admitted into the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in May 1994. It was known that the peso was overvalued, but the extent of the Mexican economy's vulnerability was either not well known or downplayed by both the Salinas administration and the media.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This vulnerability was further aggravated by several unexpected events and macroeconomic mistakes made in the last year of his administration.\n\nSeveral economists and historians have analyzed some of the events and policy mistakes that precipitated the crisis of December 1994.<ref>Hufbauer and Schoot, (2005)</ref> In keeping with the PRI election-year practices, Salinas launched a spending spree to finance popular projects, which translated into a historically high deficit. This budget deficit was coupled with a current account deficit, fueled by excessive consumer spending as allowed by the overvalued peso. In order to finance this deficit, the Salinas administration issued ''tesobonos'', an attractive debt instrument that insured payment in dollars instead of pesos.\n\nIncreasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (''tesobono'') investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9&nbsp;billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves.<ref>Hufbauer & Schott, 2005</ref> Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the [[Bank of Mexico]] decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.\n\n==Successor first days crises==\n===Peso devaluation===\n{{See also|1994 economic crisis in Mexico}}\nSoon after taking office, Zedillo announced that his government would let the fixed exchange rate band increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g.,&nbsp;by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects. Whether the effects were aggravated further or not, the result was that the peso crashed under a floating regime from four pesos to the dollar (with the previous increase of 15%) to 7.2 to the dollar in the space of a week.\n\nMexican businesses with debts to be paid in dollars, or that relied on supplies bought from the United States, suffered an immediate hit, with mass industrial lay-offs and several suicides.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} To make matters worse, the devaluation announcement was made mid-week, on a Wednesday, and for the remainder of the week foreign investors fled the Mexican market without any government action to prevent or discourage the flight until the following Monday, when it was too late.\n\nSalinas faced widespread criticism in Mexico. He was widely blamed for the collapse of the economy and his privatization of several government-run businesses such as Telmex.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} With respect to the collapse of the economy, he rapidly responded by blaming Zedillo's \"inept\" handling of the situation, coining the term \"December mistake\" to refer to the crisis and Zedillo's mistakes. He then argued that he had talked to Zedillo of a possibility of \"sharing the burden\" of the devaluation by allowing the peso to devaluate a certain percent before his term was over, and the rest of the necessary devaluation would have been done during Zedillo's administration.\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\nInitially the Zedillo administration followed Salinas's policies regarding the negotiations with the Zapatistas, pledging to reach a peaceful resolution to the Chiapas crisis. Zedillo then reversed course and on February 9, 1995, identifying [[Subcomandante Marcos]] to be [[Subcomandante Marcos|Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n Vicente]], and pursued military intervention. He abandoned that unsuccessful strategy and peace talks were subsequently re-established. Zedillo's zigzag policies in Chiapas were consistent with some others of his administration.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997 p. 1641</ref>\n\n===Break with Zedillo, Ra\u00fal Salinas arrest and self-exile===\nErnesto Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who had no political experience or independent base of power. There was a perception that Salinas wanted to follow the precedent of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] who wielded tremendous power over three successor presidents following the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]].<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" p. 1640</ref> However, this changed when by order of [[Ernesto Zedillo|president Zedillo]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siempre.mx/2019/04/la-corte-y-los-calzones-del-presidente/|title=La corte y los calzones del presidente|date=2019-04-11|website=Siempre!|language=es|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Salinas's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] was arrested on 28 February 1995 under charges of orchestrating the assassination of Ruiz Massieu; the arrest dramatically shifted the political situation. Since 1940 when president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] left the presidency and turned power over to his successor, Mexican former presidents had not directly intervened in politics. After the arrest of his brother, Salinas went on television, expressing his outrage at Zedillo. In the broadcast he placed the blame for the December peso crisis on Zedillo, resulting in the loss of Mexican jobs, bankruptcies, and the tarnishing of Mexico's image.<ref>Andres Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos: Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, Politicians, and Mexico's Road to Prosperity''. Boston: Little Brown and Company 2000, p. 1996.</ref>\n\nSalinas abandoned his campaign -which had been backed by the United States- to become the Director-General of the [[World Trade Organization]] and left Mexico City, going to Monterrey where he staged a publicized hunger strike in the home of a PRI supporter. [[Arturo Warman]], Minister of Agrarian Reform, was sent to Monterrey to persuade Salinas to return to Mexico City. Salinas demanded that the government issue a statement clearing him of responsibility for the Colosio case and the December 20 devaluation. Salinas returned to Mexico City and he and Zedillo met. Zedillo's government issued a statement absolving Salinas of the Colosio murder and tempered his criticism of Salinas in the peso crisis.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 207-08</ref>  Salinas left Mexico for self-imposed exile and settled in Ireland for a period.\n\n==Post-Presidential years==\nSalinas's reputation was to be further clouded by a series of controversies involving close family members. His brother Ra\u00fal had been arrested in February 1995. In November 1995, Ra\u00fal's wife, [[:es:Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n|Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], after attempting to withdraw US$84 million from an account owned by Ra\u00fal Salinas under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, even though Ra\u00fal Salinas had never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that Ra\u00fal Salinas had transferred over $90 million out of Mexico into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRIVATE BANKING : Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering|website=Gao.gov|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Ra\u00fal Salinas, to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The Salinas family would not receive back any of the frozen funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Salinas_funds_finally_head_back_to_Mexico.html?cid=6740256 |title=Switzerland will return blocked Salinas funds to Mexico \u2013 swissinfo |website=Swissinfo.ch |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, while Salinas was in exile and his brother Ra\u00fal in jail, their father, Ra\u00fal Salinas Lozano was accused in a U.S court of being connected to drug dealing by a convicted Mexican trafficker, Magdalena Ruiz Pelayo; the senior Salinas denied the charges.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/31/world/scandal-pushes-powerful-family-from-pinnacle-in-mexico.html</ref>\n\nSalinas divorced his first wife, Cecilia Occelli Gonz\u00e1lez, in 1995 soon after leaving office.

In July 1999, an appeals court cut the sentence to 27 1/2 years.

It was a key cabinet position since Mexico was in dire financial circumstances following the presidency of [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]], who as a desperate measure had nationalized the banks in Mexico and expropriated dollar-denominated savings accounts. The country held no hard currency reserves, exhaustion of foreign credit, and soaring interest rates. the Ministries of Finance and Planning and Budget became the most powerful positions to deal with the economic crisis. In the cabinet, Salinas's main rival was [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]], Minister of Finance.  In the internecine politics that would decide who would succeed De la Madrid as president, Salinas sought to destroy the reputation of Silva Herzog. Another key figure in the cabinet was [[Manuel Bartlett]], Minister of the Interior, with whom Salinas forged a non-compete alliance. Salinas also forged other alliances within the circles of power and did not directly compete with De la Madrid for public attention. Silva Herzog made missteps in his ministry, which Salinas capitalized on, forcing his resignation.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 63-68</ref>\n\n==Presidential election 1988==\n{{Main|1988 Mexican general election}}\n\n\"Not in their worst nightmares could the lords of the PRI have imagined what would happen to them on the sixth of July 1988. As they had done six years before, the electorate came out to vote, but not in support of the official candidate. They came to the voting booths to punish him.\"<ref>[[Enrique Krauze]], ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 770.</ref>  Carlos Salinas had become presidential candidate in a difficult time for the PRI which for the first time was faced by significant opposition from the left ([[National Democratic Front (Mexico)|National Democratic Front]]) and from the right ([[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], PAN). The candidate of the PAN was [[Manuel Clouthier]].\n\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas Sol\u00f3rzano]], son of President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], registered as an opposing candidate from a left-wing coalition called ''Frente Democr\u00e1tico Nacional''. He rapidly became a popular figure, and became the first opposing candidate to fill the ''[[Z\u00f3calo]]'' with sympathizers and to seriously threaten the PRI, which had won all presidential elections since its inception in 1929. The Ministry of the Interior ([[Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n]]), through its Federal Electoral Commission, was the institution in charge of the electoral process, and installed a modern computing system to count the votes. On election day July 6, 1988, the system \"crashed\", and when it was finally restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner. Even though the elections are extremely controversial, and some maintain that Salinas won legally, the expression ''se cay\u00f3 el sistema'' (\"the system crashed\") became a colloquial euphemism for electoral fraud. As one observer put it, \"For the ordinary citizen, it was not the computer network but the Mexican political system that had crashed.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. p. 770.</ref>\n\nThe process involved two suspicious shutdowns of the computer system used to keep track of the number of votes.<ref name=\"july6book\">{{cite book|last=Vald\u00e9s|first=Leonardo|author2=Piekarewicz Sigal, Mina|title=M\u00e9xico, el 6 de julio de 1988 : segundo informe sobre la democracia|editor=Gonz\u00e1lez Casanova, Pablo |publisher=Siglo Vientiuno Editores : Centro de Investigaciones Interdisciplinarias en Humanidades, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico|location=Mexico City|year=1990|chapter=La organizaci\u00f3n de las elecciones|isbn=978-968-23-1651-7 |oclc=23953244 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTdvt22y08QC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76|accessdate=2009-04-19|language=Spanish}}</ref> Suspicions later grew as [[Congress of the Union|Congress]] voted (with support from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Revolutionary Institutional]] and [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action]] parties)<ref name=\"aguayo-boletas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sergioaguayo.org/articulos/2008/ART08-01-16.pdf |title=Las boletas |last=Aguayo Quezada |first=Sergio |date=2008-01-16 |publisher=Reforma |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-04-19 |quote=El 88 termin\u00f3 siendo un detonante de la transici\u00f3n y cal\u00f3 muy hondo la ignominiosa quema de las boletas electorales de 1988 aprobada por el PRI y el PAN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003064650/http://www.sergioaguayo.org/articulos/2008/ART08-01-16.pdf |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> to destroy without opening the electoral documentation.

When the PRI candidate in the 1994 elections, [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] was assassinated in March 1994, new restrictions barring cabinet ministers who had not resigned in the six months previous to the election date from being candidates for the presidency meant that Salinas had a small pool of eligible choices.\n\n===Domestic issues===\nIn his inaugural address in December 1988, he outlined an ambitious and important goal of \"modernizing\" Mexico.\"<ref>Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach\".

Article 6, fn. 40.</ref>\n\nDuring his six-year term in office (''sexenio'') major changes were made to the [[Constitution of 1917]] that affected political reform; church-state relations, ending many aspects of [[anticlericalism]] restricting the Catholic Church and other religious organizations; agrarian reform, ending redistribution of land under Article 27; and policy changes on \"indigenous peoples, human rights, economic activities of the state, [and] criminal due process.\"<ref name=\"Jorge A. Vargas 1998\"/>\n\n====First steps====\nImmediately upon his inauguration, he arrested prominent union leaders, many of whom were his opponents in the PRI, among other measures to demonstrate his determination to set his own course. His government privatized state-run companies, including Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, sold to PRI-insider [[Carlos Slim]], as well as re-privatizing banks that President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] had nationalized at the end of his term. The funds from these sales of state assets helped pay off Mexico's internal debt.  However, there were also bailouts for banks and the Mexican toll roads that became scandals.<ref>Bussey, \"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\", p. 1331</ref>\n\n====Economic policy====\nSalinas continued with the [[neoliberal]] economic policy of his predecessor [[Miguel de la Madrid]] and converted Mexico into a regulatory state.<ref>Remonda Bensabat Kleinberg,  \"Strategic Alliances: State\u2010Business Relations in Mexico Under Neo\u2010Liberalism and Crisis.\" ''Bulletin of Latin American Research'' 18.1 (1999): 71-87.</ref> During his presidential term,  he aggressively privatized hundreds of state-run companies, including telecommunications, steel, and mining.

Shortly after leaving office, due to the so-called [[Mexican peso crisis|December Mistake]], inflation rose again to 51%.\n\nDuring his term, the peso devalued from 2.65 MXP to 3.60 [[MXN]] per U.S. dollar by November 30, 1994, the last day of his term; thus the peso devalued far less than it had in the two previous terms. (The peso was later devalued from 4 per dollar to 7.2 in a single week due to the \"December Mistake.\")\n\n====Poverty alleviation====\nSalinas established the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL), a [[Social Welfare in Mexico|social welfare program]], as a way to directly aid poor Mexicans, but also create a network of support for Salinas.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"Social spending and political support: The\" lessons\" of the National Solidarity Program in Mexico.\" Comparative Politics (1996): 151-177.</ref>  It was his first official act as president.  The program channeled public funds, which the administration said came largely from privatization of  state-owned companies, into impoverished areas to improve roads, the electrical grid, schools, and clinics in order to raise levels of education and health and link remote areas, with lack of oversight in its spending.<ref>Paul Lawrence Haber, \"Neoliberalism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1016.</ref><ref>Bussey, \"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\", pp. 1331-32</ref> The program was similar to those in other countries to manage the disruption and political costs of macroeconomic adjustment. Salinas's Harvard doctoral dissertation had examined the relationship between social programs and political support for the government. Given the Salinas's questionable legitimacy as the winner of the 1988 election, PRONASOL was seen as a way for Salinas to deliver immediate benefits to the poor and avert their turning to other political parties or worse. It did not prioritize funding for Mexico's poorest states, but rather to states with middle-income populations where elections were most contested and where the PRI had lost. Politically, the program sought to undermine the appeal of leftists, especially [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]].<ref>Haber, \"Neoliberalism\", p. 1016.</ref> In Chiapas, PRONASOL channeled increased funds in 1993 and 1994, but it did not prevent the [[Zapatista uprising]], which showed that the program had only a limited impact.<ref>Jonathan Fox, \"Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, (PRONASOL)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1360-1362</ref><ref>Cornelius, Wayne, Ann Craig, and Jonathan Fox, eds.

In the 1980s, the church saw electoral participation reform and fighting electoral fraud as an issue. Sometime during the presidential campaign, the PRI had indicated to the Church that a Salinas victory would be beneficial to the Church. It has been considered a quid pro quo agreement.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'', see esp. chapter 5, \"Salinismo, the Church, and Quid Pro Quo\".</ref>\nA delegation of the leadership of the episcopal hierarchy attended the inauguration of Salinas on December 1, 1988.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'' p. 71-72.</ref> After the 1988 election the Mexican bishops did not make public statements about the election results. Behind the scenes the apostolic delegate to Mexico, the Vatican's representative, Mexican bishops, and government officials had a series of secret meetings that hammered out the outlines of a new Church-State relationship. In his inaugural address, Salinas de Gortari announced a program to \"modernize\" Mexico via structural transformation. \"The modern state is a state which ... maintains transparency and updates its relation with political parties, entrepreneurial groups, and the church.\"<ref>Salinas, quoted in Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach.\" ''Journal of Church & State'', Autumn 1993, vol. 35.

A major change was the creation of the [[Instituto Nacional Electoral|Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) in October 1990, taking elections out of the hands of the Ministry of the Interior to create an independent entity.\n\nThe [[1994 Mexican general election|1994 elections]] were the first to have international observers, and were considered, at that time, the fairest elections in the century, although not free of controversy.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/world/mexico-invites-un-to-attend-election-to-observe-the-observers.html |title= Mexico Invites U.N. to Attend Election to Observe the Observers|author= Tim Golden|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date = May 13, 1994}}</ref>  For the first time, the PRI lost its two-thirds majority in Congress, which is necessary to conduct constitutional reforms.<ref name=\"Rivera Ayala 2008 388\">{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=388}}</ref>\n\n====Human rights====\nIn 1990, the [[National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)|National Human Rights Commission]] (''Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos'') was created.<ref name=\"Delgado de Cant\u00fa 2003 484\">{{cite book|last=Delgado de Cant\u00fa|first=Gloria M.|title=M\u00e9xico, estructuras pol\u00edtica, econ\u00f3mica y social|year=2003|publisher=Pearson Educaci\u00f3n|pages=484}}</ref>  Initially a government agency, it became a separate entity,\n\n====Education====\nIn 1992, Salinas and his Secretary of Education, [[Ernesto Zedillo]] introduced new compulsory history texts in Mexican schools, part of the Mexican Free-Textbook Program.

Shifts in emphasis concerned the [[Porfiriato]] and the role of foreign investment, [[Emiliano Zapata]], lauding him as a hero despite his having opposed every government in power; [[U.S.-Mexico relations]], avoiding negative treatment of the history; and the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]], treating it dispassionately.  The government was compelled to withdraw them in January 1993.  According to one assessment, \"While the 1992 textbook controversy disclosed new support for the regime from the right, it also revealed an erosion of support and discipline within officialdom.\"<ref>Dennis Gilbert, \"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\" ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' 13(2), summer 1997 p. 295.</ref>\n\n===North American Free Trade Agreement===\n{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}\n{{See also|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}\n[[File:Nafta.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Carlos Salinas (left), [[George H.&nbsp;W.

The agreement was a reversal of Mexico's longstanding policies of economic nationalism and anti-Americanism and was intended to create a single market. Mexican proponents of NAFTA saw it in a way to secure markets for its exports and attract foreign investment, and create jobs, help the government to be able to service its foreign debt, and overall, promote economic recovery. In Mexico, the reversal was controversial, opposed by organized labor, many academics, and nongovernmental organizations.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1021-22.</ref>\n\n===Drug trafficking and corruption===\n{{Main|Mexican Drug War}}\nAn issue of importance both domestic and foreign policy is drug trafficking. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico was a transit country for [[cocaine]] produced in Colombia and destined for consumers in the United States. President De la Madrid considered drug trafficking a national security issue and devoted government funding to it. Salinas expanded this funding, but neither president stemmed the growth of trafficking and its impact on Mexico. Drug trafficking is highly lucrative for those involved with it, and Mexico's weak law enforcement and judicial system could not prevent the wide-scale involvement of Mexico's poorly-paid police from being corrupted. The Mexican military to a lesser extent was corrupted, along with politicians, and some journalists. Such corruption undermined the possibility of rule of law and it prevented Mexicans from having trust in the state.

Salinas also renegotiated Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, Salinas had traveled to Europe to attract non-North American capital investment, but dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc opened them to foreign investment; Mexico was less attractive to them and Salinas turned to North America.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\", p. 1021.</ref> Critics say that  NAFTA has had mixed results for Mexico: while there has been huge increase in commerce and foreign investment, this has not been at all the case for employment and salaries.<ref name=\"eluniversal.com.mx\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Mexico hosted the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a venue where the parties in the civil war in El Salvador signed an accord ending the long conflict.<ref>Diana Negroponte, \"Implementation of the Chapultepec Peace Accords\" in ''Seeking Peace in El Salvador: The Struggle to Reconstruct a Nation at the End of the Cold War''.

Moreover, Mexico became member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). The First [[Ibero-American Summit]] was held and the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a peace agreement for El Salvador, were signed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=393}}</ref>\n\nSalinas in 1991 visited United States to help convince the Illinois Governor, [[James R. Thompson]] to pardon four Mexican citizens from a quadruple murder known as the Milwaukee Ave Massacre, that took place in 1981 in Chicago, Illinois. With the help of Carlos Salinas de Gortari the four men, Joaquin Varela, Rogelio Arroyo, Ignacio Varela, and Isauro Sanchez, had their sentences commuted, later pardoned by Governor [[Jim Edgar]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==1994 Election year==\nAs the 1994 presidential election approached, Salinas had the crucial decision to designate the candidate for the PRI; that person had always gone on to win the presidential election. \"The shipwreck of the 1988 succession should have sufficed to teach Salinas to prevent another disaster from befalling the system he had inherited.\"<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 89.</ref> At the time Salinas made the choice, popularity and credibility was high over the course of his presidency,<ref>Villarreal, Andres. \u201cPublic Opinion of the Economy and the President among Mexico City Residents: The Salinas Sexenio.\u201d Latin American Research Review, vol. 34, no. 2, 1999, p. 131 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2503915 accessed 21 March 2019</ref> but a series of events in the final year of his presidency changed that.\n\n===Choosing the PRI Nominee===\n\nThe \"unveiling\" of the PRI candidate for the presidency was on 28 November 1993, with Salinas choosing [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]]. Those considered for the position were [[Manuel Camacho Solis|Manuel Camacho]] and Colosio, with earlier contenders, such as [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]] and [[Pedro Aspe]] being eliminated. Aspe, a graduate of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] had a high international profile, but was considered unlikely to actually attract voters.  The changed circumstances of the Mexican political system, as demonstrated by Salinas's own election to the presidency, meant that being designated the PRI did not guarantee election. Aspe was not a charismatic prospect as a candidate who could energize and charm voters.  With the potential that Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas was likely to run again for the presidency, the PRI needed to field someone who could garner votes.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 92-96.</ref>\n\n===Zapatista rebellion===\n{{Main|Zapatista Army of National Liberation}}\n[[File:Flag of the EZLN.jpg|thumb|Flag of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)]]\nThe uprising in Chiapas on 1 January 1994 coincided with the date that the NAFTA came into effect. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', EZLN) issued their first declaration from the state of [[Chiapas]] in southern Mexico. Salinas's immediate response was to find for a peaceful solution: offering pardon to deposed arms; ordering a cease fire; appointing a peace negotiator, and sending Mexican Congress a General Amnesty Law. Salinas's presidential successor took a harder line when he was inaugurated. But Salinas's more peaceful solution [[1995 Zapatista Crisis|Zapatista uprising]] was legal and politically pragmatic, likely saving many lives in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&article=12183|title=La \u00danica l\u00ednea es que no tenemos l\u00ednea|website=Enlineadirecta.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Buzos|website=Buzos.com.mx|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&rl=wh&#93; |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825194625/https://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958 |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Zapatista rebellion did not spread regionally or nationwide, but the fact that it happened and that international attention was drawn to this poor region of Mexico just as NAFTA was implemented meant that Salinas's careful plans for a peaceful political transition with his legacy intact were obliterated.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 106</ref> Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the government's peace mediator. For Salinas, this had political benefits, since Camacho, having been passed over as the PRI presidential candidate, could have bolted from the party. With this important appointment, he was in the public limelight again.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 107.</ref>\n\n===Assassination of Colosio and the new PRI Candidate===\n[[File:Luis Donaldo Colosio Los Pinos Mexico 2018.jpg|thumb|Bust of Colosio at Los Pinos]]\nA spectacular political event of 1994 was the assassination of Salinas's handpicked PRI presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] in March 1994, upending the already complex electoral situation with elections scheduled for August 1994. The Zapatista uprising had ruined Salinas's plans for a peaceful transition of Mexico in the elections.  There is evidence that Salinas and Colosio began to disagree, not unusual after the electoral transfer, but this occurred prior to it. His campaign languished with lack of funding, Colosio had problems getting media coverage, given the high-profile events in Chiapas. Salinas prevented Colosio from going to Chiapas, while the explanation that his presence there would complicate the situation. Increasingly there was the impression that Salinas would reverse his decision for Colosio, substituting someone else, perhaps [[Manuel Camacho]]. Camacho was a politically savvy former [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Head of Government of Mexico City]] as well as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas.  Salinas made a public statement on 17 January 1994, affirming his choice as candidate, but this was at the insistence of Colosio. Salinas extracted a pledge from Camacho that he had no designs on the presidency, which he renounced the day before Colosio's assassination in Tijuana 23 March 1994.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 108- 109</ref>  After a few days of weighing his options, Salinas chose Colosio's campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, former Minister of Education, as the new PRI candidate for the presidency. Zedillo had been Secretary of Education, a relatively unimportant ministry; he had resigned to run the campaign of Colosio. Zedillo had never held elective office, sharing that trait with De la Madrid and Salinas, but Zedillo was not otherwise experienced politically. He was perceived as a weak candidate. There are speculation that Salinas wished to perpetuate his power as [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] had in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], controlling successor presidents.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1641</ref>\n\n===1994 General Election===\n{{See|1994 Mexican general election}}\nAfter considering whether to postpone the general election scheduled for 21 August 1994, Salinas chose Zedillo to run as the PRI candidate for the presidency and the elections took place as scheduled. Voters came out in large numbers to choose between three main candidates, Zedillo for the PRI, C\u00e1rdenas for the Party of Democratic Revolution, and [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] for the PAN. Zedillo won a clear victory, in what were considered by foreign observers as free and fair. In results published by the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), Zedillo got 48.7%, Cevallos 25.9%, and C\u00e1rdenas 16.6%.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061115072642/http://www.ife.org.mx/documentos/RESELEC/nuevo_1994/pres_94/nac_edo/nac_pre_94.html accessed 25 March 2019</ref>\n\n===Another political assassination===\nFollowing the election in September 1994, Secretary General of the PRI [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], Salinas' former brother-in-law, was assassinated in downtown Mexico City in broad daylight. The murder was not solved during Salinas's presidency, even when [[:es:Mario Ruiz Massieu|Mario Ruiz Massieu]] (Francisco's brother) was the [[Attorney General of Mexico|attorney general]] and in charge of the investigation.\n\n===Economic issues===\nThe economic bubble gave Mexico a prosperity not seen in a generation. This period of rapid growth coupled with low inflation prompted some political thinkers and the media to state that Mexico was on the verge of becoming a \"First World nation\". In fact, it was the first of the \"newly industrialized nations\" to be admitted into the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in May 1994. It was known that the peso was overvalued, but the extent of the Mexican economy's vulnerability was either not well known or downplayed by both the Salinas administration and the media.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This vulnerability was further aggravated by several unexpected events and macroeconomic mistakes made in the last year of his administration.\n\nSeveral economists and historians have analyzed some of the events and policy mistakes that precipitated the crisis of December 1994.<ref>Hufbauer and Schoot, (2005)</ref> In keeping with the PRI election-year practices, Salinas launched a spending spree to finance popular projects, which translated into a historically high deficit. This budget deficit was coupled with a current account deficit, fueled by excessive consumer spending as allowed by the overvalued peso. In order to finance this deficit, the Salinas administration issued ''tesobonos'', an attractive debt instrument that insured payment in dollars instead of pesos.\n\nIncreasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (''tesobono'') investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9&nbsp;billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves.<ref>Hufbauer & Schott, 2005</ref> Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the [[Bank of Mexico]] decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.\n\n==Successor first days crises==\n===Peso devaluation===\n{{See also|1994 economic crisis in Mexico}}\nSoon after taking office, Zedillo announced that his government would let the fixed exchange rate band increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g.,&nbsp;by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects. Whether the effects were aggravated further or not, the result was that the peso crashed under a floating regime from four pesos to the dollar (with the previous increase of 15%) to 7.2 to the dollar in the space of a week.\n\nMexican businesses with debts to be paid in dollars, or that relied on supplies bought from the United States, suffered an immediate hit, with mass industrial lay-offs and several suicides.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} To make matters worse, the devaluation announcement was made mid-week, on a Wednesday, and for the remainder of the week foreign investors fled the Mexican market without any government action to prevent or discourage the flight until the following Monday, when it was too late.\n\nSalinas faced widespread criticism in Mexico. He was widely blamed for the collapse of the economy and his privatization of several government-run businesses such as Telmex.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} With respect to the collapse of the economy, he rapidly responded by blaming Zedillo's \"inept\" handling of the situation, coining the term \"December mistake\" to refer to the crisis and Zedillo's mistakes. He then argued that he had talked to Zedillo of a possibility of \"sharing the burden\" of the devaluation by allowing the peso to devaluate a certain percent before his term was over, and the rest of the necessary devaluation would have been done during Zedillo's administration.\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\nInitially the Zedillo administration followed Salinas's policies regarding the negotiations with the Zapatistas, pledging to reach a peaceful resolution to the Chiapas crisis. Zedillo then reversed course and on February 9, 1995, identifying [[Subcomandante Marcos]] to be [[Subcomandante Marcos|Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n Vicente]], and pursued military intervention. He abandoned that unsuccessful strategy and peace talks were subsequently re-established. Zedillo's zigzag policies in Chiapas were consistent with some others of his administration.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997 p. 1641</ref>\n\n===Break with Zedillo, Ra\u00fal Salinas arrest and self-exile===\nErnesto Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who had no political experience or independent base of power. There was a perception that Salinas wanted to follow the precedent of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] who wielded tremendous power over three successor presidents following the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]].<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" p. 1640</ref> However, this changed when by order of [[Ernesto Zedillo|president Zedillo]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siempre.mx/2019/04/la-corte-y-los-calzones-del-presidente/|title=La corte y los calzones del presidente|date=2019-04-11|website=Siempre!|language=es|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Salinas's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] was arrested on 28 February 1995 under charges of orchestrating the assasination of Ruiz Massieu; the arrest dramatically shifted the political situation. Since 1940 when president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] left the presidency and turned power over to his successor, Mexican former presidents had not directly intervened in politics. After the arrest of his brother, Salinas went on television, expressing his outrage at Zedillo. In the broadcast he placed the blame for the December peso crisis on Zedillo, resulting in the loss of Mexican jobs, bankruptcies, and the tarnishing of Mexico's image.<ref>Andres Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos: Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, Politicians, and Mexico's Road to Prosperity''. Boston: Little Brown and Company 2000, p. 1996.</ref>\n\nSalinas abandoned his campaign -which had been backed by the United States- to become the Director-General of the [[World Trade Organization]] and left Mexico City, going to Monterrey where he staged a publicized hunger strike in the home of a PRI supporter. [[Arturo Warman]], Minister of Agrarian Reform, was sent to Monterrey to persuade Salinas to return to Mexico City. Salinas demanded that the government issue a statement clearing him of responsibility for the Colosio case and the December 20 devaluation. Salinas returned to Mexico City and he and Zedillo met. Zedillo's government issued a statement absolving Salinas of the Colosio murder and tempered his criticism of Salinas in the peso crisis.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 207-08</ref>  Salinas left Mexico for self-imposed exile and settled in Ireland for a period.\n\n==Post-Presidential years==\nSalinas's reputation was to be further clouded by a series of controversies involving close family members. His brother Ra\u00fal had been arrested in February 1995. In November 1995, Ra\u00fal's wife, [[:es:Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n|Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], after attempting to withdraw US$84 million from an account owned by Ra\u00fal Salinas under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, even though Ra\u00fal Salinas had never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that Ra\u00fal Salinas had transferred over $90 million out of Mexico into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRIVATE BANKING : Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering|website=Gao.gov|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Ra\u00fal Salinas, to the government of Mexico.
