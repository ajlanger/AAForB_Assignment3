Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourteenth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[C. Robert Cargill]], and stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as surgeon Stephen Strange along with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Benedict Wong]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\n''Doctor Strange'' had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide, was met with praise for its visuals and cast, and received awards attention, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[#Sequel|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', is scheduled for release on May 7, 2021.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Kathmandu]], the sorcerer [[Kaecilius]] and his zealots enter the secret compound [[Kamar-Taj]] and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the [[Ancient One]], a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]] tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]], a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the [[astral plane]] and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]], in New York City, [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the [[Cloak of Levitation]], only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a [[time loop]] around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Strange decides to help [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who has brought his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to Earth to search for their father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]].{{refn|name=Ragnarok|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Doctor Strange cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Left to right: Cumberbatch, Derrickson, Swinton, McAdams, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen, and Wong at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do NOT add cast members unless they are confirmed by a reliable source.

Strange is also aided by a [[Cloak of Levitation]] for flight, and the [[Eye of Agamotto]], a relic containing an [[Infinity Stone]] that can [[List of time travel works of fiction#Time travel in films|manipulate time]].<ref name=\"FeigePowersObjects\" /><ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Cumberbatch took great care in defining the physical movements and gestures for the spells, knowing that they would be noted and studied by fans.<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures\" /> He described these gestures as \"balletic\" and \"very dynamic\",<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures2\" /> and received help with [[finger-tutting]] movements from dancer JayFunk.<ref name=\"FingerTutting\" />\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Baron Mordo|Karl Mordo]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, close to the [[Ancient One]] and a mentor to Strange. This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos, and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /><ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> Ejiofor noted this, calling Mordo \"a very complex character that, really, I don't think can be nailed down either way\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> Director [[Scott Derrickson]] added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Ejiofor described Mordo's relationship with the Ancient One as \"long and intense\",<ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> while noting a \"growing respect\" between the character and Strange, until \"things get complicated\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Derrickson felt Mordo was a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], saying \"When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code, the process of breaking out of that is a violent one. He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One's [moral contradictions]. The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction. Mordo cannot cope with it,\"<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> which leads to the \"antagonism between Mordo and Strange\" to explore in future films.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Discussing the diversity of the film's cast when addressing the controversial casting of the characters the Ancient One and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo, and thus changing the character \"from white to black\", was the right one to make.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]]: <br />An emergency surgeon<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /><ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> initially written as a love interest for Strange, but shortly before filming, Derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making the two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming \"out the other side of it as friends\". McAdams described this dynamic by saying, \"The love is between them no matter what stage they're at in the actual relationship.\"<ref name=\"NoLoveInterest\" /> With this change in characterization, producer [[Kevin Feige]] described Palmer as a \"lynchpin to [Strange's] old life, once he steps into the role of a sorcerer. She is someone he connects with at the beginning, and reconnects with, and helps anchor his humanity.\"<ref name=\"McAdams3\" /> He explained that having this character be a \"connection to Strange's life in New York City, in the normal world\" after his journey was important to the studio, which is why Palmer was chosen for the character over the more prominent, but more fantastical character [[Clea]].<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg3\" /> Palmer is also known as the hero [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] in the comics, a storyline that does not play into the film, but that Feige hinted could be explored in future films. [[Rosario Dawson]] portrays another Night Nurse character, [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], in Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix television series]].<ref name=\"NightNurse\" />\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]:<ref name=\"Wong\" /> <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of [[Kamar-Taj]]'s most valuable relics and books.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> The character is depicted in the comics as Strange's Asian, \"tea-making manservant\", a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] that Derrickson did not want in the film,<ref name=\"WongCut\" /><ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> and so the character was not included in the film's script. After the non-Asian actress [[Tilda Swinton]] was cast as the other significant Asian character from the ''Doctor Strange'' comics, the Ancient One\u2014which was also done to avoid the comics' racial stereotypes\u2014Derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include Wong in the film. The character as he ultimately appears is \"completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn't fall into any of the stereotypes of the comics\",<ref name=\"WongCut\" /> which Derrickson was pleased gave an Asian character \"a strong presence in the movie\".<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Actor Wong was also pleased with the changes made to the character, and described him as \"a drill sergeant to Kamar-Taj\" rather than a manservant. He does not practice martial arts in the film, avoiding another racial stereotype.<ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> Derrickson added that Wong will have \"a strong presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" moving forward.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Nicodemus West]]: A rival surgeon to Strange.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" />\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jonathan Pangborn: A [[paraplegic]] who learned from the Ancient One how to heal himself through the mystic arts.<ref name=\"Bratt\" /><ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /><ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Lucian: One of Kaecilius' followers.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Lucian\"/>\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Kaecilius]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts who broke away from the Ancient One.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Derrickson compared this dynamic to that of [[Saruman]] and [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', giving the film a \"huge and fantastical\" villain like Sauron, but also having \"human relateability\" with Kaecilius, like Saruman, for Strange to face throughout the film.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> Derrickson admitted that Marvel's villains are often criticized, and noted that MCU films dedicate little time to developing antagonists. For ''Doctor Strange'', he just hoped to show \"Kaecilius's point of view and what makes him tick\" in the time that he could,<ref name=\"DerricksonVillainOct2016\" /> feeling that the character is a \"man of ideas\" with \"watertight logic\" like John Doe from ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|the Joker]] from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> On these motivations, Feige explained that Kaecilius believes the Ancient One is a hypocrite, protecting her own power base, and that the world may be better off \"if we were to allow some of these other things through.\"<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Mikkelsen's makeup took between 2\u20133 hours to apply.<ref name=\"MikkelsenMakeup\" />\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as the [[Ancient One]]: <br />A [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] mystic<ref name=\"MarvelAncientOneResponse\" /> who becomes Strange's mentor.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> The character in the comics is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] man, a situation which co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] compared to the [[Kobayashi Maru]], an unwinnable training exercise in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and would involve the film with the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /><ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Derrickson wanted to change the character to be an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the [[Dragon Lady]] stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting [[Asian fetish]] and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as [[Androgyny|androgynous]], while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.<ref name=\"SwintonDec2015\" /><ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]].<ref name=\"SwintonResponse\" /> In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity [[Dormammu]]. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /><ref name=\"DormammuVoice\" /> The producers also had [[Tony Todd]] record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.<ref name=\"ToddDormammu\" />\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> Additionally, [[Linda Louise Duan]] appears, unnamed, as [[Tina Minoru]],<ref name=\"Duan\" /><ref name=\"MinoruUnnamed\" /> Mark Anthony Brighton portrays [[Daniel Drumm]],<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on [[Hamir the Hermit]], Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character is neither a manservant nor Wong's father in the film.<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius,<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"Phythian\" /> and [[Pat Kiernan]] appears as himself.<ref name=\"KiernanCameo\" /> Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a bus rider reading [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''.<ref name=\"StanLee\" /><ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" /> [[Amy Landecker]] was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, but the majority of her role was cut from the finished film.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Doctor Strange]] was initially listed as being in development at [[New World Pictures]],<ref name=\"NewWorld\" /> with a script dated January 21, 1986 by [[Bob Gale]].<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production.<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> By 1989, [[Alex Cox]] had co-written a script with Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]]. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain [[Dormammu]] on [[Easter Island]], [[Chile]]. A film using this script was almost made by [[Regency Enterprises|Regency]], but the company's films were [[Film distributor|distributed]] by [[Warner Bros.]] at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising.<ref name=\"AlexCox\" /> By December 1992, [[Wes Craven]] had signed to write and direct ''Doctor Strange'' for release in either 1994 or 1995, with [[Savoy Pictures]] distributing.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref name=\"Variety2\" /> In 1995, [[David S. Goyer]] had completed a script for the film.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> By April 1997, [[Columbia Pictures]] had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch was working on a new screenplay, with [[Bernie Brillstein]] and [[Brad Grey]] producing.<ref name=\"Variety3\" />\n\nBy April 2000, Columbia dropped ''Doctor Strange'', which then had [[Michael France]] attached to write a script and interest from [[Chuck Russell]] and [[Stephen Norrington]] to direct.<ref name=\"ColumbiaDrop\" /> By June 2001, [[Dimension Films]] acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of ''[[Murder Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\"Goyer\" /> and promised not to be highly dependent on [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /> However, by August 2001, [[Miramax]] acquired the film rights from Dimension,<ref name=\"Miramax\" /> and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"GoyerDrop\" /> A 2005 release date was announced the next March,<ref name=\"2005release\" /> while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. [[Marvel Studios]] CEO [[Avi Arad]] stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real [[Jerry Garcia]] of the writing community.\"<ref name=\"AradWriter\" /> In April 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired ''Doctor Strange'' from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Paramount\" /> In 2007, [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing. Gaiman was especially interested in including the character [[Clea]], but the studio was not interested.<ref name=\"IndieWiredelToro\" />\n\nIn March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Doctor Strange.<ref name=\"Writers2009\" /> In June 2010, Marvel Studios hired [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] to write ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"MarvelStudios\" /> While promoting ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' in April 2011, actor [[Patrick Dempsey]] indicated he was lobbying to play the title character.<ref name=\"Dempsey\" /> In January 2013, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that Doctor Strange would appear in some capacity as part of \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]]\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PhaseThree\" /> Feige then reiterated that a Doctor Strange feature film was in development at Marvel Studios that May,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2013\" /><ref name=\"HollywoodReporterMay2013\" /> and again in November.<ref name=\"FeigeNov2013\" /> In February 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Marvel was considering [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], [[Jonathan Levine]], [[Nikolaj Arcel]] and [[Dean Israelite]] to direct the film, and was considering [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger]] to rewrite the film's script.<ref name=\"THRFeb2014\" /> Feige denied this report, but confirmed that Marvel was considering prospective candidates.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2014\" /> By March, Marvel was considering Andrews, Levine, and [[Scott Derrickson]] to direct the film.<ref name=\"IGNMarch2014\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=I think when you consider the work that I've done it makes sense that he'd be my favorite comic book character, at least in the Marvel universe.

I feel such an affinity for the character and the story and the ambition of those comics, especially the original [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] ''[[Strange Tales]]''\u2014I think those are my favorite of all of them. The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.|source=\u2014Scott Derrickson, director of ''Doctor Strange''<ref name=\"DerricksonQuote\" />}}\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.<ref name=\"Derrickson\" /> He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the [[astral plane]] while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic ''[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]]''. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an [[Storyboards#Animatics|animatic]], which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct ''Doctor Strange'' than any of their other films.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for ''Doctor Strange'' through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" />\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]], with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> with [[Jon Spaihts]] hired to rewrite the script instead.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Spaihts\" /> Spaihts, a big fan of ''Doctor Strange'' as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> Derrickson wanted [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /><ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, \"the most present villain in the comics\", became the film's main villain.<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" />\n\nDuring the early development process, Marvel, Derrickson, and Spaihts all envisioned [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] playing the title role.<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> By the end of June, Marvel had reportedly been looking at [[Tom Hardy]] and [[Jared Leto]] for the film's lead as well,<ref name=\"Spaihts\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineJun2014\" /> while [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], who worked with Derrickson on 2014's ''[[Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)|Deliver Us from Evil]]'', had discussed a possible role with the director.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /> In July, after fans and the media had also championed Cumberbatch for the role of Doctor Strange, the actor explained at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that he would be unable to accept the role due to commitments to other projects.<ref name=\"CumberbatchConflicts\" /> Feige stated that a lead actor would be announced \"relatively quickly\",<ref name=\"JulyCasting\" /> and by the end of that month [[Joaquin Phoenix]] entered talks to play the character.<ref name=\"Phoenix\" /><ref name=\"Phoenix2\" /> By September 2014, Marvel Studios was in negotiations to shoot ''Doctor Strange'' at [[The Pinewood Studios Group|Pinewood-Shepperton]] in England, with crews being assembled for a move into [[Shepperton Studios]] in late 2014/early 2015, for filming in May 2015.<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> Negotiations with Phoenix ended in October 2014,<ref name=\"Phoenix3\" /> as the actor felt that blockbuster films would never be \"fulfilling\", with \"too many requirements that went against [his] instincts for character.\"<ref name=\"PhoenixReason\" /> Marvel then placed Leto, [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[Keanu Reeves]] on their shortlist for the character.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> [[Ryan Gosling]] also had discussions to play the character,<ref name=\"Gosling\" /> while Reeves was not approached about the role,<ref name=\"Reeves\" /> and Cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> In October, Cumberbatch entered negotiations to play the character,<ref name=\"Cumberbatch\" /> and was officially cast in December.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /> Feige explained that Marvel had kept returning to him for the role while considering other actors,<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" /> with Derrickson noting that even during discussions with Phoenix, he and Marvel still wanted to cast Cumberbatch in the role.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> The company eventually decided to change the film's production schedule to fit around Cumberbatch's commitments, allowing him to join the project.<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" />\n\n[[File:Scott Derrickson by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Derrickson promoting ''Doctor Strange'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nWith the film's new production schedule, its intended release date was pushed back to November 2016,<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and Derrickson was able to do some work on the script himself. He brought Cargill in to work with him on this as was originally planned. Describing the film, Cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film, saying \"it's a very magical fantasy universe, but at the same time it plays by some of the superhero tropes that people enjoy.\"<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Spaihts returned later in the process to \"do some more writing and help bring the movie home\", and said he was \"delighted\" by the work that Derrickson and Cargill had done in the interim.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Feige and Derrickson have noted that, in addition to ''The Oath'' and Steve Ditko's original work on Doctor Strange, an influence on all the film's writers was the Doctor Strange comic book ''Into Shamballa''.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" />\n\nIn January 2015, [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] entered preliminary talks with Marvel for a role in the film,<ref name=\"Ejiofor\" /> later revealed to be [[Baron Mordo]].<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited [[New York City]] to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November.<ref name=\"NYCScoutingNovFilming\" /> A month later, [[Tilda Swinton]] was in talks to play the [[Ancient One]].<ref name=\"Swinton\" /> In June 2015, Derrickson announced that he was going to London to begin work on the film,<ref name=\"DerricksonLondon\" /> and Feige confirmed that Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] would appear, located on [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], as in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July,<ref name=\"SwintonConfirmed\" /> when [[Rachel McAdams]] was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that \"it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna go, if it's gonna go anywhere at all\",<ref name=\"McAdams\" /> but she ultimately confirmed her role during the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /> [[Mads Mikkelsen]] entered into early negotiations to play a villain in August,<ref name=\"VarietyMikkelsen\" /> \"one of a number of actors being considered for the unspecified villainous role.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineMikkelsen\" />\n\nIn September 2015, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn]] stated that many of the crew that worked on that film were unable to return for [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|its sequel]], because they had committed to ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"Crew\" /> Derrickson also revealed that Gunn had provided notes on the script, beyond the general conversing the MCU directors have between themselves for their films.<ref name=\"GunnNotes\" /> At the end of the month, Feige stated that additional casting announcements would be made \"before the end of the year\",<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> and by early November, [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] entered negotiations to appear in the film as Nicodemus West, a rival of Strange.<ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" /> Derrickson had offered the role to Stuhlbarg because he was interested in working with the actor, and he agreed to join the cast after reading some Doctor Strange comics and being drawn to the character's \"guilt-ridden arc\" where West \"blames himself for ruining the surgery on Strange's hands and robbing him of his ability to operate\".<ref name=\"StuhlbargReasons\" />\n\nFeige felt that the visuals of the film needed \"to be a [[Steve Ditko|Ditko]]/[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]]/[[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]/''[[The Matrix]]'' mind-trip\",<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> and said that \"You don't get into it in ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', but if a scientist went to [[Hogwarts]] he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Harry Potter'', wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Feige called ''Doctor Strange'' the \"doorway\" into the supernatural side of the MCU,<ref name=\"FeigeAprilSupernatural\" /> a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the ''Doctor Strange'' comics \"broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel multiverse]]\".<ref name=\"MCUMultiverse\" /> Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' \"[[Earth-616]] and Earth 617\", but would instead feature \"dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them\",<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.<ref name=\"DarkDimension\" /><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\n[[Astrophysicist]] [[Adam Frank]] served as a scientific consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood.<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" /> Frank advised on \"the human experience of space and time\", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or \"had this enlarged perspective.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant\" /> He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate that \"amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities\u2014people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Nepal]] on November 4, 2015, under the [[working title]] ''Checkmate''.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', described ''Doctor Strange'' as Marvel's ''Fantasia'', and noted that a lot of [[previsualization]] was required to figure out how to shoot the \"[[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]\", [[M.

[[Vision Research Phantom]] Flex 4Ks, which shoot up to 1000 [[Frame rate|fps]], were used for high speed sequences like Strange's car crash.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\n[[File:Benedict Cumberbatch on the set of Doctor Strange.jpg|thumb|Cumberbatch filming ''Doctor Strange'' in [[Kathmandu]], November 2015]]\nDerrickson chose Nepal as a location to feature an \"Eastern city\" that would not be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]]. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this\u2014which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension\u2014that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The eventual filming locations around the [[Kathmandu Valley]] included the [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Swayambhunath]] Temples;<ref name=\"NepalShooting\" /> [[Thamel]] and [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]] in [[Kathmandu]];<ref name=\"NepalShooting4\" /> and the [[Patan Durbar Square]] in [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].<ref name=\"NepalShooting3\" /><ref name=\"NepalShooting5\" />\n\nProduction moved to [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England on November 11,<ref name=\"Longcross\" /> and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingScheduledEnd\" /> The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The inside of [[Kamar-Taj]] was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> [[Citypoint]] on Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.<ref name=\"Citypoint\" />\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> and in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /> Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /><ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> and later in London.<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> alongside [[Amy Landecker]] and [[Scott Adkins]] in unspecified roles.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Landecker\" /> Additionally, [[Benedict Wong]] heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> He was cast as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in January,<ref name=\"Wong\" /> and immediately joined the production for filming.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> [[Lamborghini]] provided six [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n#Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4 Spyder (2016\u2013)|Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4s]] for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"<ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at [[Northfleet]], Kent by the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"KentFilming\" /> Also in January 2016, filming took place at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in [[CERN]], due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> Production moved to New York City's [[Flatiron District]] in April,<ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.<ref name=\"Phythian\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in New York City on April 3, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn June 2016, a [[Diamond Select Toys]] press release for ''Doctor Strange'' toys, in their Marvel [[Minimates]] line, named Mikkelsen's character [[Kaecilius]] and McAdams' character [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]].<ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic Con 2016.<ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> Additionally, [[Benjamin Bratt]] was revealed to have been cast<ref name=\"Bratt\" /> as Jonathan Pangborn;<ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /> Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> The latter was mostly cut from the film,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the [[White House]] for her series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.<ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> Also, Derrickson revealed that [[Lulu Wilson]] had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" />\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.<ref name=\"WongReshootWrap\" /> [[Dan Harmon]] wrote material for these additional scenes,<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.<ref name=\"Harmon2\" /> Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"<ref name=\"Harmon3\" /> Before the film's sets were demolished, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' director [[Taika Waititi]] took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting [[Chris Hemsworth]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. The scene was for ''Ragnarok'' and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to ''Doctor Strange'' as a mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" /> A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential ''Doctor Strange'' sequel.<ref name=\"PostCreditScene\" /> Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective ''Doctor Strange'' scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.<ref name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word [[wikt:excelsior|excelsior]] meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a ''[[Garfield]]'' book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the ''Garfield'' option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.<ref name=\"GunnLeeOptions\" /> By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.<ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" />\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"<ref name=\"Feige3DUse\" /> He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.<ref name=\"Feige3DCollider\" /> Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\nVisual effects for ''Doctor Strange'' were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Method Studios]], [[Framestore]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> contributing to 1450 effects shots. [[Previsualization]] was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> Visual effects supervisor [[Stephane Ceretti]], who also worked on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [''Guardians''], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. ''Guardians'' was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" />\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher\".<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, [[fractal]] videos from [[YouTube]]\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesVisuals\" /> Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new\u2014to not just blow things up.\"<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on ''The Oath'' comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take ''[[Inception]]'' \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".<ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor Strange mirror dimension.jpg|thumb|left|The Manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen (top), with visual effects added by [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] (bottom).<ref name=\"FXguide\" />]]\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in ''The Avengers'') and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] in ''Ant-Man'', worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" /> Framestore also worked on environment shots, the [[Mandelbrot set]] sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a [[geode]]. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff\u2026 these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time\u2014the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"<ref name=\"IGNVFX2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Doctor Strange (soundtrack)}}\nIn May 2016, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed that he would score the film.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with [[Temp track|temp music]].\"<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"AbbeyRoad\" /> During a recording session, [[Paul McCartney]] heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to [[The Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\".<ref name=\"Walrus\" /> Derrickson, a [[Bob Dylan]] fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name=\"BobDylanPinkFloyd\" /><ref name=\"PinkFloyd\" /> Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" for the film's credits, but the [[Royalty payment#Music royalties|royalties]] to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track \"The Master of the Mystic End Credits\".<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> A soundtrack album from [[Hollywood Records]] was released digitally on October 21, 2016, with a physical release on November 18, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn August 2015, a concept art trailer narrated by Derrickson was shown at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]]. The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"D232015\" /> The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"<ref name=\"D232015\" />\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name=\"KimmelTrailer\" /><ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film ''Inception'',<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> as did Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]''. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to ''The Matrix'' and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s [[Gregory House]] from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Marvel Comics]] released a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|prelude tie-in comic]] written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Forn\u00e9s.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts\u2013Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm\u2013pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> A second issue, centered on the [[Ancient One]] training apprentices in the magical arts at [[Kamar-Taj]], was released a month later.<ref name=\"PreludeComic2\" /> Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila]].<ref name=\"AsiaPopClip\" /> In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,<ref name=\"InfinitePrelude\" /> while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Blu-ray.<ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], and [[Society for Science & the Public]], announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]]. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.<ref name=\"ScienceContest\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" /> Umberto Gonzales of [[TheWrap]] called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapIMAXReaction\" /> Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"[[Seth Rogen]]'s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushIMAXReaction\" /> [[IGN]]'s Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".<ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\nMarvel provided [[Twitter]] stickers, [[Giphy]] content, [[Facebook]] Live, [[Snapchat]] lenses and filter, [[Tumblr]] stunts, and [[Instagram]] special content related to the film. Additionally, [[Microsoft Surface]] had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process.

Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" /> Mara Reinstein of ''[[US Weekly]]'' called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here \u2013 save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"<ref name=\"USWeeklyReview\" /> [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' called ''Doctor Strange'' \"an awkwardly clich\u00e9-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense...

There's so much progress that can be made.\" He would like to follow the example of ''The Dark Knight'' and \"bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more ''Doctor Strange'' solo film.<ref name=\"DenofGeekOct2016\" /> Derrickson hoped to feature<!--NIGHTMARE IS ALREADY WIKILINKED TO THE COMIC CHARACTER ABOVE--> Nightmare in a potential sequel,<ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is being \"kept in the loop\" about how the ''Avengers'' films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" /> Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing [[Clea]] appear in a potential sequel.<ref name=\"CleaSequelPotential\" /> By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, ''[[Locke & Key (TV series)|Locke & Key]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelReturn\" /> Despite no official announcements, Wong said in October 2018 that he expected filming on a sequel to begin by the end of that year.<ref name=\"WongSequelFilming\" /> By December 2018, Derrickson had \"quietly\" finalized a deal to return to direct the sequel, and Cumberbatch and Wong were confirmed to reprise their roles from the first film, with McAdams stated as likely to return.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed2\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the sequel was announced as ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'', with a release date of May 7, 2021. Feige and Derrickson revealed that the sequel would have more of a horror tone than the first film, that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] would reprise her MCU role of [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch]], and that her [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' would tie into the events of the film.<ref name=\"SequelHorror\" /><ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> The film would also tie into the Disney+ series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref name=\"LokiSequel\" /> In October 2019, ''Collider'' reported that Jade Bartlett would be the film's screenwriter.<ref name=\"SequelBartlett\" /> In January 2020, Marvel and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences, but would remain an executive producer on the film. No delays were expected for the start of filming that May.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelExit\" /> By February, it was reported that [[Sam Raimi]] was in negotiations to take over as director, Ejiofor

was shooting some stunt work with Zoe Saldana \u2013 I run between sets on one soundstage. Stan laughing at The Doors of Perception was what ended up in the film, but we shot other options, such as \u2013 Stan reading a book and leaning into the guy next to him, saying, 'Do you know what excelsior means?' \u2013 Stan throwing his head back and laughing as hard as he can, yelling, 'I'm laughing for no reason! I'm totally crazy!' \u2013 And, my favorite, Stan laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, hooting, 'He HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!' Supposedly that one was in the film for a while, but it ended up being too long for the scene.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourteenth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[C. Robert Cargill]], and stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as surgeon Stephen Strange along with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Benedict Wong]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\n''Doctor Strange'' had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide, was met with praise for its visuals and cast, and received awards attention, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[#Sequel|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', is scheduled for release on May 7, 2021.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Kathmandu]], the sorcerer [[Kaecilius]] and his zealots enter the secret compound [[Kamar-Taj]] and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the [[Ancient One]], a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]] tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]], a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the [[astral plane]] and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]], in New York City, [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the [[Cloak of Levitation]], only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a [[time loop]] around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Strange decides to help [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who has brought his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to Earth to search for their father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]].{{refn|name=Ragnarok|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Doctor Strange cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Left to right: Cumberbatch, Derrickson, Swinton, McAdams, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen, and Wong at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do NOT add cast members unless they are confirmed by a reliable source.

This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos, and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /><ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> Ejiofor noted this, calling Mordo \"a very complex character that, really, I don't think can be nailed down either way\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> Director [[Scott Derrickson]] added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Ejiofor described Mordo's relationship with the Ancient One as \"long and intense\",<ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> while noting a \"growing respect\" between the character and Strange, until \"things get complicated\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Derrickson felt Mordo was a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], saying \"When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code, the process of breaking out of that is a violent one. He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One's [moral contradictions]. The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction. Mordo cannot cope with it,\"<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> which leads to the \"antagonism between Mordo and Strange\" to explore in future films.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Discussing the diversity of the film's cast when addressing the controversial casting of the characters the Ancient One and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo, and thus changing the character \"from white to black\", was the right one to make.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]]: <br />An emergency surgeon<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /><ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> initially written as a love interest for Strange, but shortly before filming, Derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making the two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming \"out the other side of it as friends\". McAdams described this dynamic by saying, \"The love is between them no matter what stage they're at in the actual relationship.\"<ref name=\"NoLoveInterest\" /> With this change in characterization, producer [[Kevin Feige]] described Palmer as a \"lynchpin to [Strange's] old life, once he steps into the role of a sorcerer. She is someone he connects with at the beginning, and reconnects with, and helps anchor his humanity.\"<ref name=\"McAdams3\" /> He explained that having this character be a \"connection to Strange's life in New York City, in the normal world\" after his journey was important to the studio, which is why Palmer was chosen for the character over the more prominent, but more fantastical character [[Clea]].<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg3\" /> Palmer is also known as the hero [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] in the comics, a storyline that does not play into the film, but that Feige hinted could be explored in future films. [[Rosario Dawson]] portrays another Night Nurse character, [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], in Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix television series]].<ref name=\"NightNurse\" />\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]:<ref name=\"Wong\" /> <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of [[Kamar-Taj]]'s most valuable relics and books.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> The character is depicted in the comics as Strange's Asian, \"tea-making manservant\", a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] that Derrickson did not want in the film,<ref name=\"WongCut\" /><ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> and so the character was not included in the film's script. After the non-Asian actress [[Tilda Swinton]] was cast as the other significant Asian character from the ''Doctor Strange'' comics, the Ancient One\u2014which was also done to avoid the comics' racial stereotypes\u2014Derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include Wong in the film. The character as he ultimately appears is \"completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn't fall into any of the stereotypes of the comics\",<ref name=\"WongCut\" /> which Derrickson was pleased gave an Asian character \"a strong presence in the movie\".<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Actor Wong was also pleased with the changes made to the character, and described him as \"a drill sergeant to Kamar-Taj\" rather than a manservant. He does not practice martial arts in the film, avoiding another racial stereotype.<ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> Derrickson added that Wong will have \"a strong presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" moving forward.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Nicodemus West]]: A rival surgeon to Strange.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" />\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jonathan Pangborn: A [[paraplegic]] who learned from the Ancient One how to heal himself through the mystic arts.<ref name=\"Bratt\" /><ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /><ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Lucian: One of Kaecilius' followers.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Lucian\"/>\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Kaecilius]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts who broke away from the Ancient One.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Derrickson compared this dynamic to that of [[Saruman]] and [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', giving the film a \"huge and fantastical\" villain like Sauron, but also having \"human relateability\" with Kaecilius, like Saruman, for Strange to face throughout the film.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> Derrickson admitted that Marvel's villains are often criticized, and noted that MCU films dedicate little time to developing antagonists. For ''Doctor Strange'', he just hoped to show \"Kaecilius's point of view and what makes him tick\" in the time that he could,<ref name=\"DerricksonVillainOct2016\" /> feeling that the character is a \"man of ideas\" with \"watertight logic\" like John Doe from ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|the Joker]] from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> On these motivations, Feige explained that Kaecilius believes the Ancient One is a hypocrite, protecting her own power base, and that the world may be better off \"if we were to allow some of these other things through.\"<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Mikkelsen's makeup took between 2\u20133 hours to apply.<ref name=\"MikkelsenMakeup\" />\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as the [[Ancient One]]: <br />A [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] mystic<ref name=\"MarvelAncientOneResponse\" /> who becomes Strange's mentor.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> The character in the comics is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] man, a situation which co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] compared to the [[Kobayashi Maru]], an unwinnable training exercise in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and would involve the film with the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /><ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Derrickson wanted to change the character to be an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the [[Dragon Lady]] stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting [[Asian fetish]] and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as [[Androgyny|androgynous]], while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.<ref name=\"SwintonDec2015\" /><ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]].<ref name=\"SwintonResponse\" /> In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity [[Dormammu]]. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /><ref name=\"DormammuVoice\" /> The producers also had [[Tony Todd]] record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.<ref name=\"ToddDormammu\" />\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> Additionally, [[Linda Louise Duan]] appears, unnamed, as [[Tina Minoru]],<ref name=\"Duan\" /><ref name=\"MinoruUnnamed\" /> Mark Anthony Brighton portrays [[Daniel Drumm]],<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One.

Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of ''[[Murder Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\"Goyer\" /> and promised not to be highly dependent on [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /> However, by August 2001, [[Miramax]] acquired the film rights from Dimension,<ref name=\"Miramax\" /> and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"GoyerDrop\" /> A 2005 release date was announced the next March,<ref name=\"2005release\" /> while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. [[Marvel Studios]] CEO [[Avi Arad]] stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real [[Jerry Garcia]] of the writing community.\"<ref name=\"AradWriter\" /> In April 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired ''Doctor Strange'' from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Paramount\" /> In 2007, [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing.

The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.|source=\u2014Scott Derrickson, director of ''Doctor Strange''<ref name=\"DerricksonQuote\" />}}\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.<ref name=\"Derrickson\" /> He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the [[astral plane]] while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic ''[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]]''. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an [[Storyboards#Animatics|animatic]], which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct ''Doctor Strange'' than any of their other films.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for ''Doctor Strange'' through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" />\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]], with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> with [[Jon Spaihts]] hired to rewrite the script instead.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Spaihts\" /> Spaihts, a big fan of ''Doctor Strange'' as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> Derrickson wanted [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /><ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces.

We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Harry Potter'', wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal.

So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities\u2014people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Nepal]] on November 4, 2015, under the [[working title]] ''Checkmate''.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', described ''Doctor Strange'' as Marvel's ''Fantasia'', and noted that a lot of [[previsualization]] was required to figure out how to shoot the \"[[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]\", [[M.

After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]]. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this\u2014which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension\u2014that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The eventual filming locations around the [[Kathmandu Valley]] included the [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Swayambhunath]] Temples;<ref name=\"NepalShooting\" /> [[Thamel]] and [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]] in [[Kathmandu]];<ref name=\"NepalShooting4\" /> and the [[Patan Durbar Square]] in [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].<ref name=\"NepalShooting3\" /><ref name=\"NepalShooting5\" />\n\nProduction moved to [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England on November 11,<ref name=\"Longcross\" /> and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingScheduledEnd\" /> The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The inside of [[Kamar-Taj]] was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> [[Citypoint]] in Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.<ref name=\"Citypoint\" />\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> and in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /> Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /><ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> and later in London.<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> alongside [[Amy Landecker]] and [[Scott Adkins]] in unspecified roles.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Landecker\" /> Additionally, [[Benedict Wong]] heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> He was cast as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in January,<ref name=\"Wong\" /> and immediately joined the production for filming.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> [[Lamborghini]] provided six [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n#Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4 Spyder (2016\u2013)|Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4s]] for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"<ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at [[Northfleet]], Kent by the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"KentFilming\" /> Also in January 2016, filming took place at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in [[CERN]], due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> Production moved to New York City's [[Flatiron District]] in April,<ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.<ref name=\"Phythian\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in New York City on April 3, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn June 2016, a [[Diamond Select Toys]] press release for ''Doctor Strange'' toys, in their Marvel [[Minimates]] line, named Mikkelsen's character [[Kaecilius]] and McAdams' character [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]].<ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic Con 2016.<ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> Additionally, [[Benjamin Bratt]] was revealed to have been cast<ref name=\"Bratt\" /> as Jonathan Pangborn;<ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /> Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> The latter was mostly cut from the film,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the [[White House]] for her series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.<ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> Also, Derrickson revealed that [[Lulu Wilson]] had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" />\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.<ref name=\"WongReshootWrap\" /> [[Dan Harmon]] wrote material for these additional scenes,<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.<ref name=\"Harmon2\" /> Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"<ref name=\"Harmon3\" /> Before the film's sets were demolished, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' director [[Taika Waititi]] took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting [[Chris Hemsworth]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. The scene was for ''Ragnarok'' and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to ''Doctor Strange'' as a mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" /> A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential ''Doctor Strange'' sequel.<ref name=\"PostCreditScene\" /> Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective ''Doctor Strange'' scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.<ref name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word [[wikt:excelsior|excelsior]] meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a ''[[Garfield]]'' book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the ''Garfield'' option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.<ref name=\"GunnLeeOptions\" /> By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.<ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" />\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"<ref name=\"Feige3DUse\" /> He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.<ref name=\"Feige3DCollider\" /> Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\nVisual effects for ''Doctor Strange'' were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Method Studios]], [[Framestore]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> contributing to 1450 effects shots. [[Previsualization]] was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> Visual effects supervisor [[Stephane Ceretti]], who also worked on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [''Guardians''], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. ''Guardians'' was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" />\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher\".<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, [[fractal]] videos from [[YouTube]]\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesVisuals\" /> Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new\u2014to not just blow things up.\"<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on ''The Oath'' comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take ''[[Inception]]'' \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".<ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor Strange mirror dimension.jpg|thumb|left|The Manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen (top), with visual effects added by [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] (bottom).<ref name=\"FXguide\" />]]\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in ''The Avengers'') and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] in ''Ant-Man'', worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" /> Framestore also worked on environment shots, the [[Mandelbrot set]] sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a [[geode]]. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff\u2026 these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time\u2014the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"<ref name=\"IGNVFX2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Doctor Strange (soundtrack)}}\nIn May 2016, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed that he would score the film.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with [[Temp track|temp music]].\"<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"AbbeyRoad\" /> During a recording session, [[Paul McCartney]] heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to [[The Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\".<ref name=\"Walrus\" /> Derrickson, a [[Bob Dylan]] fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name=\"BobDylanPinkFloyd\" /><ref name=\"PinkFloyd\" /> Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" for the film's credits, but the [[Royalty payment#Music royalties|royalties]] to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track \"The Master of the Mystic End Credits\".<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> A soundtrack album from [[Hollywood Records]] was released digitally on October 21, 2016, with a physical release on November 18, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn August 2015, a concept art trailer narrated by Derrickson was shown at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]]. The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"D232015\" /> The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"<ref name=\"D232015\" />\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name=\"KimmelTrailer\" /><ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film ''Inception'',<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> as did Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]''. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to ''The Matrix'' and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s [[Gregory House]] from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Marvel Comics]] released a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|prelude tie-in comic]] written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Forn\u00e9s.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts\u2013Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm\u2013pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> A second issue, centered on the [[Ancient One]] training apprentices in the magical arts at [[Kamar-Taj]], was released a month later.<ref name=\"PreludeComic2\" /> Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila]].<ref name=\"AsiaPopClip\" /> In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,<ref name=\"InfinitePrelude\" /> while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Blu-ray.<ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], and [[Society for Science & the Public]], announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]]. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.<ref name=\"ScienceContest\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" /> Umberto Gonzales of [[TheWrap]] called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapIMAXReaction\" /> Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"[[Seth Rogen]]'s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushIMAXReaction\" /> [[IGN]]'s Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".<ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\nMarvel provided [[Twitter]] stickers, [[Giphy]] content, [[Facebook]] Live, [[Snapchat]] lenses and filter, [[Tumblr]] stunts, and [[Instagram]] special content related to the film. Additionally, [[Microsoft Surface]] had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process.

Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" /> Mara Reinstein of ''[[US Weekly]]'' called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here \u2013 save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"<ref name=\"USWeeklyReview\" /> [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' called ''Doctor Strange'' \"an awkwardly clich\u00e9-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense...

There's so much progress that can be made.\" He would like to follow the example of ''The Dark Knight'' and \"bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more ''Doctor Strange'' solo film.<ref name=\"DenofGeekOct2016\" /> Derrickson hoped to feature<!--NIGHTMARE IS ALREADY WIKILINKED TO THE COMIC CHARACTER ABOVE--> Nightmare in a potential sequel,<ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is being \"kept in the loop\" about how the ''Avengers'' films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" /> Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing [[Clea]] appear in a potential sequel.<ref name=\"CleaSequelPotential\" /> By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, ''[[Locke & Key (TV series)|Locke & Key]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelReturn\" /> Despite no official announcements, Wong said in October 2018 that he expected filming on a sequel to begin by the end of that year.<ref name=\"WongSequelFilming\" /> By December 2018, Derrickson had \"quietly\" finalized a deal to return to direct the sequel, and Cumberbatch and Wong were confirmed to reprise their roles from the first film, with McAdams stated as likely to return.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed2\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the sequel was announced as ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'', with a release date of May 7, 2021. Feige and Derrickson revealed that the sequel would have more of a horror tone than the first film, that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] would reprise her MCU role of [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch]], and that her [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' would tie into the events of the film.<ref name=\"SequelHorror\" /><ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> The film would also tie into the Disney+ series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref name=\"LokiSequel\" /> In October 2019, ''Collider'' reported that Jade Bartlett would be the film's screenwriter.<ref name=\"SequelBartlett\" /> In January 2020, Marvel and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences, but would remain an executive producer on the film. No delays were expected for the start of filming that May.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelExit\" /> By February, it was reported that [[Sam Raimi]] was in negotiations to take over as director, Ejiofor

was shooting some stunt work with Zoe Saldana \u2013 I run between sets on one soundstage. Stan laughing at The Doors of Perception was what ended up in the film, but we shot other options, such as \u2013 Stan reading a book and leaning into the guy next to him, saying, 'Do you know what excelsior means?' \u2013 Stan throwing his head back and laughing as hard as he can, yelling, 'I'm laughing for no reason! I'm totally crazy!' \u2013 And, my favorite, Stan laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, hooting, 'He HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!' Supposedly that one was in the film for a while, but it ended up being too long for the scene.
