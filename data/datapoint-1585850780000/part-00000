Robinson]] served as CEO of Scientific Atlanta for 20 years, and chairman of the board for an additional eight years, until he retired from the company in 1979. Scientific Atlanta grew dramatically; it earned $3.1 million in revenue in 1962 and approximately $200 million when Robinson left. [[Sidney Topol]] served as its president from 1971\u201383, CEO from 1975\u201387, and chairman of the board from 1978-90. During his tenure, the company grew in sales to more than $600 million. During the 1970s the company developed the concept of cable/satellite connection, which, in working with [[HBO]] and transportable earth stations developed by [[TelePrompTer Corporation]] and manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, established satellite-delivered television for the cable industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Hall of Fame 1998 - 2010 Honorees Sid Topol {{!}}|url=http://www.cablecenter.org/content.cfm?id=1055 | publisher =The Cable Center | accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s Scientific-Atlanta earned a place in the space and defense industries as a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment for antennae. By the end of that decade the company had added instruments for testing telephones and acoustic devices with defense applications. As a military contractor, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing unique electronic instruments for the federal government. According to ''Business Week'', Scientific-Atlanta was a company \"fascinated with communications esoterica.\"\n\nScientific-Atlanta applied its energy to opportunities in new fields with large growth potential and few barriers to entry. The company sought out products that were either low-cost and high volume or had a very high price tag. \"You've either got to make 10,000 of something worth $100 to $200, or several of something worth $500,000 or $10 million,\" Topol told the ''New York Times''. The company planned to make the low-cost, high volume end of this equation profitable through aggressive research and development and a strong marketing effort. In its annual report, as reprinted in David C. Rickert's Harvard Business School case study of Scientific-Atlanta, the company stated: \"Scientific-Atlanta operates under a disciplined business plan that concentrates on design, manufacture, and sale of standard technical products for the communications and instrumentation markets.\" More specifically, Topol recounted in Dun's Review, as restated by Rickert, \"I asked what products we needed for growing markets, not what markets we should go after because we had a product.\"\n\nThe answer to that question was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.\n\nThese predictions proved incorrect and as the cable television industry boomed in the mid- to late 1970s, Scientific-Atlanta grew with it. The company's profits ballooned by 40 percent a year from 1972 on as Scientific-Atlanta came to dominate the market it had largely pioneered. In 1976, as sales rose to more than $45 million, the company greatly expanded its manufacturing, laboratory, and office space at its headquarters. It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients\u2014broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel\u2014to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.\n\nIn addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.\n\nBy the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.\n\nIn addition to its two main areas of operation\u2014communications and instrumentation\u2014Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.\n\nIn August 2002, the company laid off  6 percent of the company's total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020908080838/http://hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|title=Scientific-Atlanta Cuts 400 Jobs|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=September 8, 2002|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying [[HDTV]] programming, at [[Best Buy]] stores in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. It was later rolled out nationwide. In March 2004, Scientific-Atlanta launched the Explorer 8000HD, their first set-top box with both DVR and HD.\n\nIn the set-top arena, Scientific-Atlanta once enjoyed 100% market share with [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cablevision]] and [[AT&T U-verse]]; all three companies have since started to transition to other boxes, Cablevision using [[Samsung]], while TWC and U-verse are split between SA/Cisco and competitor [[Arris International|Arris]] (formerly [[Motorola]]). [[Comcast]] also has a split account with the two companies. Other companies that have split accounts with SA and Arris are [[Suddenlink Communications]], [[Charter Communications]] and [[Cox Communications|Cox]]; the two vendors also had split accounts for [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] before that company went under in 2006. [[Pace plc]], who mainly competes in foreign markets, serves as a domestic rival, but on a limited scale.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Scientific Atlanta announced that it would be purchased by [[Cisco Systems]] in a US$6.9 billion cash deal. On February 25, 2006, Cisco Systems announced that it had completed acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in a cash deal that paid $43 per share. The total cash value of the deal was roughly US$7 billion, or US$5.1 billion net of Scientific Atlanta's cash balance, and also about US$5.1 billion over their 2005 [[shareholders' equity]]. In its fiscal year 2005, Scientific Atlanta earned $1.36 per common share (diluted).\n\nOn November 21, 2015, Cisco completed sale of its Connected Devices Business Unit (CDBU) to [[Technicolor SA]]. <ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/technicolor.html#~overview</ref> This business was comprised primarily by customer premises equipment (CPE) related hardware and software that had originated at Scientific Atlanta, including set top boxes, cable gateways / modems, CableCard devices, digital transport adapters, wireless video access points, network extenders, accessories and eleven software products related to these offerings.<ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/docs/connected-devices.pdf</ref>\n\nThe company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development of interactive video on demand infrastructure and signaling, leading to large scale [[Video on demand|VOD]] implementations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.scientificatlanta.com/ Scientific Atlanta official site]\n\n{{Atlanta companies}}\n\n[[Category:Scientific Atlanta| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Gwinnett County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Computer companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:Cisco Systems acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Computer companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:2006 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications equipment vendors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Scientific Atlanta, Inc.\n| logo             = Scientific Atlanta logo.svg\n| logo_caption     = The Scientific Atlanta logo after Cisco's acquisition\n| type             = [[Subsidiary]]\n| genre            = \n| fate             = \n| predecessor      = \n| successor        = \n| foundation       = {{Start date and age|1951}}\n| founders         = [[James E.

It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients\u2014broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel\u2014to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.\n\nIn addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.\n\nBy the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.\n\nIn addition to its two main areas of operation\u2014communications and instrumentation\u2014Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.\n\nIn August 2002, the company laid off  6 percent of the company's total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020908080838/http://hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|title=Scientific-Atlanta Cuts 400 Jobs|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=September 8, 2002|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying [[HDTV]] programming, at [[Best Buy]] stores in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. It was later rolled out nationwide. In March 2004, Scientific-Atlanta launched the Explorer 8000HD, their first set-top box with both DVR and HD.\n\nIn the set-top arena, Scientific-Atlanta once enjoyed 100% market share with [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cablevision]] and [[AT&T U-verse]]; all three companies have since started to transition to other boxes, Cablevision using [[Samsung]], while TWC and U-verse are split between SA/Cisco and competitor [[Arris International|Arris]] (formerly Motorola). [[Comcast]] also has a split account with the two companies. Other companies that have split accounts with SA and Arris are [[Suddenlink Communications]], [[Charter Communications]] and [[Cox Communications|Cox]]; the two vendors also had split accounts for [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] before that company went under in 2006. [[Pace plc]], who mainly competes in foreign markets, serves as a domestic rival, but on a limited scale.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Scientific Atlanta announced that it would be purchased by [[Cisco Systems]] in a US$6.9 billion cash deal. On February 25, 2006, Cisco Systems announced that it had completed acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in a cash deal that paid $43 per share. The total cash value of the deal was roughly US$7 billion, or US$5.1 billion net of Scientific Atlanta's cash balance, and also about US$5.1 billion over their 2005 [[shareholders' equity]]. In its fiscal year 2005, Scientific Atlanta earned $1.36 per common share (diluted).\n\nOn November 21, 2015, Cisco completed sale of its Connected Devices Business Unit (CDBU) to [[Technicolor SA]]. <ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/technicolor.html#~overview</ref> This business was comprised primarily by customer premises equipment (CPE) related hardware and software that had originated at Scientific Atlanta, including set top boxes, cable gateways / modems, CableCard devices, digital transport adapters, wireless video access points, network extenders, accessories and eleven software products related to these offerings.<ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/docs/connected-devices.pdf</ref>\n\nThe company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development of interactive video on demand infrastructure and signaling, leading to large scale [[Video on demand|VOD]] implementations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.scientificatlanta.com/ Scientific Atlanta official site]\n\n{{Atlanta companies}}\n\n[[Category:Scientific Atlanta| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Gwinnett County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Computer companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:Cisco Systems acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Computer companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:2006 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications equipment vendors]]\n", "name_user": "Napalm420", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Atlanta"}
