Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.\n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive.\n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. The family moved to [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Colorado]], in July 1993.<ref name=\"Suspects\" />\n\nThe Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Eric's older brother, Kevin, attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].<ref name=\"sides\">{{cite news |author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |access-date=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201910/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC |date=December 6, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHarris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status.\n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

Harris was required to attend [[anger management]] classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. The boys' [[probation officer]] discharged them from the program a few months ahead of schedule for good behavior.

The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs.

The two largest bombs built were found in the school cafeteria and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating.

Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be \"god-like\". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word \"WRATH\" printed in red.<ref name=USAToday/> It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed.

According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.<ref name = \"slate\"/>\n\nAccording to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of [[schizotypal personality disorder]] \u2013 he struck many people as odd, was very shy, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal, considered notable due to Klebold's peers that often described him as very intelligent. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as \"god-like\" and wrote about he was \"made a human without the possibility of BEING human.\" He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and plenty of friends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Langman | first = Peter | title = Rampage School Shooters: A Typology | orig-year = 2010 | year = 2016 | edition =  | chapter =  | chapter-url =  | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url = https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190712111604/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-date = July 12, 2019 | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =  | access-date = July 12, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Reaction of Sue Klebold===\n{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}\n\n[[Sue Klebold]], mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things.

Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties. \n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive. \n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. The family moved to [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Colorado]], in July 1993.<ref name=\"Suspects\" />\n\nThe Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Eric's older brother, Kevin, attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].<ref name=\"sides\">{{cite news |author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |access-date=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201910/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC |date=December 6, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHarris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status. \n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs. The two boys purchased six more propane tanks on the morning of the attack.\n\nMore complex bombs, such as the one that detonated on the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue, had [[time bomb|timers]]. The two largest bombs built were found in the school cafeteria and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating. It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed in the cafeteria had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.<ref>{{cite web |title=At 'perfect' school, student sat next to bomb |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_1076860,00.html |date=April 12, 2002 |work=Rocky Mountain News |first=Lynn |last=Bartels |access-date=August 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420145325/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_1076860%2C00.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{Main|Columbine High School massacre}}\n\n===Day of the massacre===\n[[File:Columbine Shooting Security Camera.jpg|thumbnail|Harris (left) and Klebold (right) on a surveillance camera on the day of the shooting]]\nOn April 20, 1999, just weeks before Harris and Klebold were both due to graduate,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/us/terror-in-littleton-the-seniors-in-horrific-circumstance-sense-of-lost-pomp.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208020853/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/us/terror-in-littleton-the-seniors-in-horrific-circumstance-sense-of-lost-pomp.html |archive-date=December 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Brooks Brown, who was smoking a cigarette outside during lunch break, saw Harris arrive at school.

Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van.
