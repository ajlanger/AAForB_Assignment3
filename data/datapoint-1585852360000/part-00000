He started his career at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], making his first team debut at the age of 17 years and 6 days, before moving to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 1983.

The Reds had been top of the league when Gibson had joined them but a disappointing second half of the season sucked them down to fourth place, and Atkinson was sacked in early November following a terrible start to the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986-87 season]].

He was also coach of the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]], assisting his former Wimbledon teammate [[Lawrie Sanchez]] to victories over England, Spain and Sweden amongst others. Prior to this he was assistant manager at [[Wycombe Wanderers]], also working alongside Sanchez where together they guided the third-tier team to the [[FA Cup]] semi-finals in 2001 where they were narrowly defeated 2-1 by Liverpool.
