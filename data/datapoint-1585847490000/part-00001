The Mekons were described as more chaotic version of the Gang of Four; Lycett stated the band operated on the principle that \"anybody could do it...anybody could get up and join in and instruments could be swapped around; that there'd be no distance between the audience and the band.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy their second show\u2013supporting the [[The Rezillos|Rezillos]] at the F-Club\u2013they were approached with a record deal by Bob Last of [[Fast Product]]. The Mekons would be the first band signed to the label. The band's first single was \"Never Been in a Riot\", a [[satire|satirical]] take on [[the Clash]]'s ''[[White Riot]]''. The release was made Single of the Week in [[NME]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Their second single, \"Where Were You?\" was released by the end of 1978 and sold out of its 27,500 copies. At this time, Last convinced the band to sign to a larger label\u2013[[Virgin Records|Virgin]]. The Mekons popularity peaked as they played on the same bill as other \"new music\" groups like Gang of Four, the [[The Fall (band)|Fall]], the [[The Human League|Human League]], and [[Stiff Little Fingers]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor several years the loose-knit band played noisy, bare-bones [[post-punk]], releasing singles on a variety of labels. The Mekons' first album, ''[[The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strnen]]'', was recorded using the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]'s instruments, and due to an error by the Virgin Records art department, featured pictures of the Gang of Four on the back cover.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAfter 1982's ''The Mekons Story,'' a compilation of old recordings, the band ceased activity for a while, with Langford forming [[The Three Johns]]. Corrigan became a tour manager for many years before founding a company that provides visa and immigration services specialising in the entertainment industry. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s (revitalised by the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984 coal miners' strike]]) the Mekons had returned as an active group. The band was now augmented by vocalist [[Sally Timms]], violinist Susie Honeyman, ex-[[The Damned (band)|Damned]] member [[Lu Edmonds]], accordionist/vocalist [[Rico Bell]] (a.k.a. [[Eric Bellis]]), and former [[The Rumour]] drummer [[Steve Goulding]]. They began to experiment with musical styles derived from traditional English [[folk music|folk]] (tentatively explored on the ''English Dancing Master'' [[Extended play|EP]] prior to the hiatus), and American [[country music]]. ''Fear and Whiskey'' (1985), ''The Edge of the World'' (1986) and ''Honky Tonkin'' (1987) exemplified the band's new sound, which built on the innovations of [[Gram Parsons]] and blended punk ethos and [[left wing]] politics with the [[minimalism|minimalist]] country of [[Hank Williams]]. Subsequent albums, such as ''[[The Mekons Rock 'n Roll]]'', continued to experiment with diverse instrumentation (notably the [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[slide guitar]], and [[Ba\u011flama|saz]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n''The Mekons Rock and Roll'' was the band's first major label release. Issued by [[A&M Records]] in 1989, ''The Mekons Rock 'n Roll'' was not a commercial success, but it was met with critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/staff-lists/5882-top-100-albums-of-the-1980s/1/|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1980s|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 November 2002|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/7175/blenders_100_greatest_indie_rock_albums_ever/franchises/list/ |title=Blender's 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever  |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref><ref name=RockNRoll_Christgau2>{{cite web |author=[[Robert Christgau|Christgau]], Robert |title=The Mekons: Rock 'n' Roll |date=24 April 2001 |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cdrev/mekonsro-not.php |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Handcuffed to History: \u2018The Mekons Rock \u2019N\u2019 Roll\u2019 Is 30 Years Old |author=Nelson, Elizabeth |date=18 September 2019 |publisher=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/9/18/20871385/mekons-rock-n-roll-30-year-anniversary |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\nJust as the Mekons began to grow in critical stature, their relationship with A&M Records became tense, and the Mekons were soon dropped by the label, unable to fulfill their commercial expectations.<ref name=RockNRoll_Christgau2/> However, they continued to record at a prolific rate, releasing such notable albums as 1991's ''The Curse of the Mekons'', 2000's ''Journey to the End of the Night'', and 2002's ''OOOH!''<ref name=NYTimes-Curse-1991>{{cite news|last1=Miles|first1=Milo|title=Recordings View; The Mekons Try a Little Wizardry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/arts/recordings-view-the-mekons-try-a-little-wizardry.html|accessdate=21 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 May 1991}}</ref> ''Natural'' moved the band to a more folk-flavoured sound.

The Mekons were described as more chaotic version of the Gang of Four; Lycett stated the band operated on the principle that \"anybody could do it...anybody could get up and join in and instruments could be swapped around; that there'd be no distance between the audience and the band.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy their second show\u2013supporting the [[The Rezillos|Rezillos]] at the F-Club\u2013they were approached with a record deal by Bob Last of [[Fast Product]]. The Mekons would be the first band signed to the label. The band's first single was \"Never Been in a Riot\", a [[satire|satirical]] take on [[the Clash]]'s ''[[White Riot]]''. The release was made Single of the Week in [[NME]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Their second single, \"Where Were You?\" was released by the end of 1978 and sold out of its 27,500 copies. At this time, Last convinced the band to sign to a larger label\u2013[[Virgin Records|Virgin]]. The Mekons popularity peaked as they played on the same bill as other \"new music\" groups like Gang of Four, the [[The Fall (band)|Fall]], the [[The Human League|Human League]], and [[Stiff Little Fingers]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor several years the loose-knit band played noisy, bare-bones [[post-punk]], releasing singles on a variety of labels. The Mekons' first album, ''[[The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strnen]]'', was recorded using the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]'s instruments, and due to an error by the Virgin Records art department, featured pictures of the Gang of Four on the back cover.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAfter 1982's ''The Mekons Story,'' a compilation of old recordings, the band ceased activity for a while, with Langford forming [[The Three Johns]]. Corrigan became a tour manager for many years before founding a company that provides visa and immigration services specialising in the entertainment industry. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s (revitalised by the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984 coal miners' strike]]) the Mekons had returned as an active group. The band was now augmented by vocalist [[Sally Timms]], violinist Susie Honeyman, ex-[[The Damned (band)|Damned]] member [[Lu Edmonds]], accordionist/vocalist [[Rico Bell]] (a.k.a. [[Eric Bellis]]), and former [[The Rumour]] drummer [[Steve Goulding]]. They began to experiment with musical styles derived from traditional English [[folk music|folk]] (tentatively explored on the ''English Dancing Master'' [[Extended play|EP]] prior to the hiatus), and American [[country music]]. ''Fear and Whiskey'' (1985), ''The Edge of the World'' (1986) and ''Honky Tonkin'' (1987) exemplified the band's new sound, which built on the innovations of [[Gram Parsons]] and blended punk ethos and [[left wing]] politics with the [[minimalism|minimalist]] country of [[Hank Williams]]. Subsequent albums, such as ''[[The Mekons Rock 'n Roll]]'', continued to experiment with diverse instrumentation (notably the [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[slide guitar]], and [[Ba\u011flama|saz]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n''The Mekons Rock and Roll'' was the band's first major label release. Issued by [[A&M Records]] in 1989, ''The Mekons Rock 'n Roll'' was not a commercial success, but it was met with critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/staff-lists/5882-top-100-albums-of-the-1980s/1/|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1980s|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 November 2002|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/7175/blenders_100_greatest_indie_rock_albums_ever/franchises/list/ |title=Blender's 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever  |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref><ref name=RockNRoll_Christgau2>{{cite web |author=[[Robert Christgau|Christgau]], Robert |title=The Mekons: Rock 'n' Roll |date=24 April 2001 |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cdrev/mekonsro-not.php |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Handcuffed to History: \u2018The Mekons Rock \u2019N\u2019 Roll\u2019 Is 30 Years Old |author=Nelson, Elizabeth |date=18 September 2019 |publisher=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/9/18/20871385/mekons-rock-n-roll-30-year-anniversary |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\nJust as the Mekons began to grow in critical stature, their relationship with A&M Records became tense, and the Mekons were soon dropped by the label, unable to fulfill their commercial expectations.<ref name=RockNRoll_Christgau2/> However, they continued to record at a prolific rate, releasing such notable albums as 1991's ''The Curse of the Mekons'', 2000's ''Journey to the End of the Night'', and 2002's ''OOOH!''<ref name=NYTimes-Curse-1991>{{cite news|last1=Miles|first1=Milo|title=Recordings View; The Mekons Try a Little Wizardry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/arts/recordings-view-the-mekons-try-a-little-wizardry.html|accessdate=21 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 May 1991}}</ref> ''Natural'' moved the band to a more folk-flavoured sound.
