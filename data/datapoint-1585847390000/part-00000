In 1964, Torn appeared as Eddie Sanderson in the episode \"The Secret in the Stone\" in ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' and in the premiere of ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]''.\n\nIn 1965, in the film ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'', he played Slade, a corrupt New Orleans millionaire, who pressures [[Steve McQueen]] during a high-stakes poker game. On television that year, Torn portrayed Colonel Royce in the episode \"The Lorelei\" of ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|Twelve O'Clock High]]''. Following these roles, he had turns as a character actor in numerous subsequent films. The part of George Hanson in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' was written for Torn by [[Terry Southern]], but according to Southern's biographer Lee Hill, Torn withdrew from the project after  co-director [[Dennis Hopper]] and he got into a bitter argument in a New York restaurant. [[Jack Nicholson]] played Hanson, instead, in a career-launching performance.\n\nIn 1972, Torn won rave reviews for his portrayal of a [[Country music|country and western]] singer in the [[cult film]] ''[[Payday (1972 film)|Payday]]''.

The screenplay was written by [[Terry Southern]] and [[Harry Nilsson]], and the film was produced by their company, Hawkeye. The story, which concerned an unhinged, out-of-work actor, had been written with [[Robin Williams]] in mind. After he turned it down, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] expressed a strong interest, but when production began, Torn reportedly had to contend with Goldberg constantly digressing and improvising, and he had to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the script.\n\nGoldberg was backed by the studio, which also allowed her to replace Torn's chosen DP, veteran cinematographer [[John A. Alonzo]], with her then-husband. As a result of the power struggle, Torn, Southern, and Nilsson cut their own version of the film, using the takes that adhered to the script and this was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but the studio put together a rival version using other takes and it was poorly reviewed when it premiered in January 1988.<ref name=\"lehi\">{{Cite book |first=Lee |last=Hill |title=A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, he portrayed Colonel Fargo in ''[[By Dawn's Early Light]]'', a film from [[HBO]] about a fictional world war.

He also had an uncredited role in ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' as Barry Mills. In 1957, Torn portrayed Jody in an early episode of ''[[The Restless Gun]]''. In 1957, he starred as incarcerated Steve Morgan in the ''[[List of Alfred Hitchcock Presents episodes|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode \"Number Twenty-Two\", and on the same series in 1961, he played a recently released prisoner, Ernie Walters, in the ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' episode \"The Kiss-Off\".<ref>full episode available at hulu.com</ref> After portraying [[Judas]], betrayer of Jesus, in 1961 epic film ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', Torn appeared as a graduate student with multiple degrees in 1963 television series ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', and as Roy Kendall in the ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'' episode \"Millions of Faces\". In 1964, Torn appeared as Eddie Sanderson in the episode \"The Secret in the Stone\" in ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' and in the premiere of ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]''.\n\nIn 1965, in the film ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'', he played Slade, a corrupt New Orleans millionaire, who pressures [[Steve McQueen]] during a high-stakes poker game.

Following these roles, he had turns as a character actor in numerous subsequent films. The part of George Hanson in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' was written for Torn by [[Terry Southern]], but according to Southern's biographer Lee Hill, Torn withdrew from the project after  co-director [[Dennis Hopper]] and he got into a bitter argument in a New York restaurant. [[Jack Nicholson]] played Hanson, instead, in a career-launching performance.\n\nIn 1972, Torn won rave reviews for his portrayal of a [[Country music|country and western]] singer in the [[cult film]] ''[[Payday (1972 film)|Payday]]''. He co-starred with singer [[David Bowie]] in the 1976 science-fiction film, ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''.

The screenplay was written by [[Terry Southern]] and [[Harry Nilsson]], and the film was produced by their company, Hawkeye. The story, which concerned an unhinged, out-of-work actor, had been written with [[Robin Williams]] in mind. After he turned it down, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] expressed a strong interest, but when production began, Torn reportedly had to contend with Goldberg constantly digressing and improvising, and he had to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the script.\n\nGoldberg was backed by the studio, which also allowed her to replace Torn's chosen DP, veteran cinematographer [[John A. Alonzo]], with her then-husband. As a result of the power struggle, Torn, Southern, and Nilsson cut their own version of the film, using the takes that adhered to the script and this was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but the studio put together a rival version using other takes and it was poorly reviewed when it premiered in January 1988.<ref name=\"lehi\">{{Cite book |first=Lee |last=Hill |title=A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, he portrayed Colonel Fargo in ''[[By Dawn's Early Light]]'', a film from [[HBO]] about a fictional world war.
