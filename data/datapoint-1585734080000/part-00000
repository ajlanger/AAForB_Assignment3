However, a tradition of introducing individual letters as heraldic charges on the basis of [[acrophony]] originates in the 15th to 16th century, primarily in personal and municipial heraldry, and with some frequency in the modern period, appearing more often on the continent than in British heraldry where letters as charges have traditionally been discouraged. Fox-Davies (1909:281) regarding letters of the alphabet as heraldic charges:\n:\"Instances of these are scarcely common, but the family of Kekitmore<ref>John Guillim, ''A Display of Heraldry'' (1780), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4FwzAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA295#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 295].</ref> may be adduced as bearing 'Gules, three [[S]]'s or,' while [[Bridlington Priory]] had for arms 'Per pale, sable and argent, three [[B]]'s countercharged.' [...] Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of alphabetical letters in the case of the B's on the shield of [[Bermondsey]].\"\n\nOne of the earliest instances of the use of letters as heraldic charges is that of the Langenmantel family of [[Augsburg]].

However, a tradition of introducing individual letters as heraldic charges on the basis of [[acrophony]] originates in the 15th to 16th century, primarily in personal and municipial heraldry, and with some frequency in the modern period, appearing more often on the continent than in British heraldry where letters as charges have traditionally been discouraged. Fox-Davies (1909:281) regarding letters of the alphabet as heraldic charges:\n:\"Instances of these are scarcely common, but the family of Kekitmore<ref>John Guillim, ''A Display of Heraldry'' (1780), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4FwzAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA295#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 295].</ref> may be adduced as bearing 'Gules, three [[S]]'s or,' while [[Bridlington Priory]] had for arms 'Per pale, sable and argent, three [[B]]'s countercharged.' [...] Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of alphabetical letters in the case of the B's on the shield of [[Bermondsey]].\"\n\nOne of the earliest instances of the use of letters as heraldic charges is that of the Langenmantel family of [[Augsburg]]. R\u00fcdiger I Langenmantel (d. 1342), one of the leading figures of the Augsburg patriciate during the first four decades of the 14th century, is the founder of the \"Langenmantel vom RR\" branch of the family, derived from his coat of arms showing two letters [[R]] (for his given name), shown [[Attitude_(heraldry)#Addorsed|addorsed]] (as mirror images).<ref>Ernst Heinrich Kneschke, ''Neues allgemeines deutsches Adelslexikon'', vol. 5, Leipzig, (1864),388f.</ref>\n\nReligious symbolism:\n*[[Shield of the Trinity|Emblem of the Trinity]]<ref>''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by A.C.
