One recommendation from the commissioners that consolidated the New Zealand statutes, prior to enactment of the Statutes Revision Act 1879 that allowed for their reprinting, was that the criminal law should be codified in a way that suited New Zealand conditions, rather than merely adopting similar legislative changes being debated in 1880 by the English Parliament. A Criminal Code bill was first drafted in 1883 and introduced into the House of Representatives in June that year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Joint Statutes Revision Committee |title=Statutes Revision Commission: Report on the Criminal Code |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_bill/ccb188431125.pdf |website=nzlii.org |accessdate=25 January 2020 |date=7 August 1883}}</ref> However, over the next 10 years the bill's passage through the Parliament failed to achieve majority support at various stages, despite repeated introductions and initial support. The bill was finally passed at the end of September 1893 and the Criminal Code Act 1893 received royal assent on 6 October 1893.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Finn |first1=Jeremy |title=Codification of the Criminal Law: the Australasian parliamentary experience. |url=https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/1828/12590980_Codification%20of%20the%20Criminal%20Law.pdf;sequence=1 |website=ir.canterbury.ac.nz |publisher=University of Canterbury |date=2003 |accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnactment of the Consolidated Statutes Enactment Act 1908 on 4 August 1908 resulted in the Criminal Code Act 1893 being consolidated into the Crimes Act 1908. The 1908 Act was further consolidated and amended with the passage of the Crimes Act 1961 on 1 November 1961.<ref name=nzlegislationcrimesact />\n\n===Since 1961===\nThe Crimes Act has been substantially amended since 1961.\n\nAmendments in 1985 resulted in crime of [[rape]] being replaced with one of [[sexual violation]], a similar offence but without gender specificity. Further changes in 2005 resulted in gender specificity being removed from all criminal sexual offences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 128: Sexual violation defined |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329051.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPart 10 of the act, ''Crimes against the right of property'', was totally rewritten in 2003.

However, due to growing general public opposition to the death penalty, reformist [[New Zealand National Party]] Minister of Justice [[Ralph Hanan]] and other National MPs exercised a [[conscience vote]] and voted with the abolitionist [[New Zealand Labour Party]] to forbid judges passing sentence of death other than in cases of treason.{{Citation needed|reason=This explanation should have asorce that documents the history of the legislation.|date=January 2019}} That was the functional abolition in New Zealand, with no one executed after this date.

Children aged between 10 and 13 years inclusive have the [[rebuttable presumption]] of incapacity to commit a crime; they cannot be charged unless the prosecution can prove the child knew what they were doing was a criminal offence.\n\nSections 50 and 169 dealt with the [[provocation defence]] which mitigated fatal assaults to the lesser charge and penalty due to [[manslaughter]], rather than [[murder]]. It was abolished through multipartisan consent in 2009, with the exception of the [[ACT New Zealand]] party.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in Hansard, or other commentary.|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]] abolished Section 59 of the Crimes Act, which had previously allowed parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, despite opposition from religious social conservatives and others.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in commentary on the parliamentary process.|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Crimes against public order (Part 5)==\nIncludes [[treason]] and other crimes against the Queen and the State; offence of oath to commit offence; unlawful assemblies, riots, and breaches of the peace; [[piracy]]; slave dealing; participation in criminal gang; and smuggling and trafficking in people.{{Explain|date=January 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC code !!

This closed a legal loophole which prevented adult females from being convicted of sexual offending against boys under 16.\n\nSection 144A of the Crimes Act deals with New Zealand citizens and ordinary residents that commit acts of [[child sexual abuse]] in overseas jurisdictions through [[child sex tourism]]. It applies existing prohibitions against sexual connection and indecent acts with children under twelve and young people to children within overseas jurisdictions. Under Section 144C, it is also illegal to promote child sex tourism overseas from New Zealand.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Prostitution Law Reform Act 2003]] decriminalised sex work, removing sections 147-149A of the Crimes Act, which had formerly prohibited most forms of [[prostitution in New Zealand]] through maintaining criminal penalties against soliciting, living off the proceeds of sex work, brothel-keeping and managing sex workers.\n\n==Crimes against the person (Part 8)==\n\nIncludes duties tending to the preservation of life; [[homicide]]; [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]]; [[abortion]]; assaults and injuries to the person; [[female genital mutilation]]; bigamy and feigned marriage; and abduction and kidnapping.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC Code<ref>{{cite web |last1=ABS |title=1234.0 - Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC), 2011 |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1234.0Main%20Features12011?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1234.0&issue=2011 |website=abs.govt.au |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> !!

A Criminal Code bill was first drafted in 1883 and introduced into the House of Representatives in June that year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Joint Statutes Revision Committee |title=Statutes Revision Commission: Report on the Criminal Code |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_bill/ccb188431125.pdf |website=nzlii.org |accessdate=25 January 2020 |date=7 August 1883}}</ref> However, over the next 10 years the bill's passage through the Parliament failed to achieve majority support at various stages, despite repeated introductions and initial support. The bill was finally passed at the end of September 1893 and the Criminal Code Act 1893 received royal assent on 6 October 1893. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Finn |first1=Jeremy |title=Codification of the Criminal Law: the Australasian parliamentary experience. |url=https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/1828/12590980_Codification%20of%20the%20Criminal%20Law.pdf;sequence=1 |website=ir.canterbury.ac.nz |publisher=University of Canterbury |date=2003 |accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnactment of the Consolidated Statutes Enactment Act 1908 on 4 August 1908 resulted in the Criminal Code Act 1893 being consolidated into the Crimes Act 1908. The 1908 Act was further consolidated and amended with the passage of the Crimes Act 1961 on 1 November 1961.<ref name=nzlegislationcrimesact />\n\n===Since 1961===\nThe Crimes Act has been substantially amended since 1961.\n\nAmendments in 1985 resulted in crime of [[rape]] being replaced with one of [[sexual violation]], a similar offence but without gender specificity. Further changes in 2005 resulted in gender specificity being removed from all criminal sexual offences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 128: Sexual violation defined |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329051.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPart 10 of the act, ''Crimes against the right of property'', was totally rewritten in 2003. In doing so, the definition of [[Burglary]] was revised and simplified to only require entry to be unauthorised rather than also requiring an act of breaking.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 231: Burglary |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM330242.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nFamily Violence related amendments in 2018 introduced offences for ''Strangulation'' and ''Assaulting a family member'', which promptly resulted in offenders being prosecuted for their offending.\n\nAn ammendment in 2019 introduced the concept of ''Burglary of agricultural land'' along with increasing penalties for ''Theft of animals'', in response to increasing reports of stock rustling as well as nighttime hunting, slaughtering and butchering of farm animals in roadside fields.\n\n==Punishments (Part 2)==\nSection 14 of the Crimes Act 1961 allowed [[capital punishment in New Zealand|death sentences]]. However, due to growing general public opposition to the death penalty, reformist [[New Zealand National Party]] Minister of Justice [[Ralph Hanan]] and other National MPs exercised a [[conscience vote]] and voted with the abolitionist [[New Zealand Labour Party]] to forbid judges passing sentence of death other than in cases of treason.{{Citation needed|reason=This explanation should have asorce that documents the history of the legislation.|date=January 2019}} That was the functional abolition in New Zealand, with no one executed after this date.

Children aged under 10 years old are assumed incapable of committing a crime and cannot be charged with any crime. Children aged between 10 and 13 years inclusive have the [[rebuttable presumption]] of incapacity to commit a crime; they cannot be charged unless the prosecution can prove the child knew what they were doing was a criminal offence.\n\nSections 50 and 169 dealt with the [[provocation defence]] which mitigated fatal assaults to the lesser charge and penalty due to [[manslaughter]], rather than [[murder]]. It was abolished through multipartisan consent in 2009, with the exception of the [[ACT New Zealand]] party.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in Hansard, or other commentary.|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]] abolished Section 59 of the Crimes Act, which had previously allowed parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, despite opposition from religious social conservatives and others.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in commentary on the parliamentary process.|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Crimes against public order (Part 5)==\nIncludes [[treason]] and other crimes against the Queen and the State; offence of oath to commit offence; unlawful assemblies, riots, and breaches of the peace; [[piracy]]; slave dealing; participation in criminal gang; and smuggling and trafficking in people.{{Explain|date=January 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC code !!

This closed a legal loophole which prevented adult females from being convicted of sexual offending against boys under 16.\n\nSection 144A of the Crimes Act deals with New Zealand citizens and ordinary residents that commit acts of [[child sexual abuse]] in overseas jurisdictions through [[child sex tourism]]. It applies existing prohibitions against sexual connection and indecent acts with children under twelve and young people to children within overseas jurisdictions. Under Section 144C, it is also illegal to promote child sex tourism overseas from New Zealand.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Prostitution Law Reform Act 2003]] decriminalised sex work, removing sections 147-149A of the Crimes Act, which had formerly prohibited most forms of [[prostitution in New Zealand]] through maintaining criminal penalties against soliciting, living off the proceeds of sex work, brothel-keeping and managing sex workers.\n\n==Crimes against the person (Part 8)==\n\nIncludes duties tending to the preservation of life; [[homicide]]; [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]]; [[abortion]]; assaults and injuries to the person; [[female genital mutilation]]; bigamy and feigned marriage; and abduction and kidnapping.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC Code<ref>{{cite web |last1=ABS |title=1234.0 - Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC), 2011 |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1234.0Main%20Features12011?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1234.0&issue=2011 |website=abs.govt.au |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> !!
