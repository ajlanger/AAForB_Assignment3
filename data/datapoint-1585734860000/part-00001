The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake's attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.\n\n==Links with other fables==\nThe fables of ''Panchatantra'' are found in numerous world languages.

Indian painting, 1610.]]\n\nIn the Indian tradition, ''The Panchatantra'' is a {{IAST|n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra}}. ''N\u012bti'' can be roughly translated as \"the wise conduct of life\"<ref name=niti/> and a ''\u015b\u0101stra'' is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are \"the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling\". It draws from the [[Dharma]] [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|and]] [[Artha]] ''\u015b\u0101stra''s, quoting them extensively.<ref name=olivelle18/> It is also explained that ''n\u012bti'' \"represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men\" and that ''n\u012bti'' is \"the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy\".<ref name=niti/>\n\n''The Panchatantra'' shares many stories in common with the Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], purportedly told by the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, \"It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the ''J\u0101taka''s or the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.\"<ref name=olivelle18/> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>Bedekar: \"Its probable relation to early folk and oral tradition of storytelling in India has been suggested by many. Rather, it is fashionable to make such statements that 'Panchatantra' and allied Katha literature in India had their origin in early folk stories. However, not a single credible evidence has been produced till this date, other than lengthy discussions on hypothetical assumptions.\"</ref> In the early 20th century, [[W. Norman Brown]] found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.<ref>[[W. Norman Brown|Brown, Norman W.]] 1919. \"'The Panchatantra' in Modern Indian Folklore\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' Vol 39, pp 1 &17: \"It is doubtless true that in the remote past many stories had their origin among the illiterate folk, often in pre-literary times, and were later taken into literature. It is also just as true that many stories that appear in literature existed there first and are not indebted to the folklore for their origin. But leaving aside questions concerning the early history of Hindu stories and dealing strictly with modern Indian fiction, we find that folklore has frequently taken its material from literature. This process has been so extensive that of the 3000 tales so far reported, all of which have been collected during the past fifty years, at least half can be shown to be derived from literary sources. [...] This table affords considerable evidence in support of the theory that it is the folk tales and not the literary tales that are borrowed.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|left|Panchtantra illustration in Nalanda Temple, 7th century CE (Turtle and the Geese)]]\nAn early Western scholar who studied ''The Panchatantra'' was Dr. [[Johannes Hertel]], who thought the book had a [[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] character.

They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government.\"<ref name=e1965/> Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching {{IAST|dharma}}, or proper moral conduct.<ref>{{citation | last=Falk|first=H. | title=Quellen des Pa\u00f1catantra | year=1978 | pages=173\u2013188}}</ref> Also:<ref>{{citation | year=1996 | title = Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions | author1=Roderick Hindery | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | isbn=978-81-208-0866-9 | page=166 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-FswBLvTkvQC&pg=PA166&dq=roguery}}</ref>\n{{quote|On the surface, the Pa\u00f1catantra presents stories and sayings which favor the outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue.

The Persian version also makes an abrupt switch from the story of the three sons to an injured ox, and thereafter parallels the ''Panchatantra''.<ref>{{citation | year=1990 | title = Burz\u014dy's voyage to India and the origin of the book of Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah | author1=Fran\u00e7ois de Blois | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-947593-06-3 | pages=22\u201323 with footnotes | url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQ6ysVz89KEC&pg=PA22 }}</ref>\n\nThe two jackals' names transmogrified into Kalila and Dimna in the Persian version. Perhaps because the first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, ''Kalila and Dimna,'' became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.\n\nAfter the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf inserted a new one, telling of Dimna's trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull \u201cShanzabeh\", a key character in the first chapter. The trial lasts for two days without conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He is found guilty and put to death.\n\nIbn al-Muqaffa' inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE \"re-telling\" (see Francois de Blois' Burz\u014dy's voyage to India and the origin of the book ''Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah'').  The political theorist Jennifer London suggests that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa' was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript). London has analysed how Ibn al-Muqaffa' could have used his version to make \"frank political expression\" at the 'Abbasid court (see J. London's \u201cHow To Do Things With Fables: Ibn al-Muqaffa''s Frank Speech in Stories from Kalila wa Dimna,\" ''History of Political Thought'' XXIX: 2 (2008)).\n\n===The Arabic classic by Ibn al-Muqaffa===\n{{See also|Safa Khulusi#Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa.27 and The Arabian_Nights}}\n[[File:Syrischer Maler von 1354 001.jpg|thumb|An illustration from a Syrian edition dated 1354.

It is not quite so strange, however, when one recalls that the Arabs had much preferred the poetic art and were at first suspicious of and untrained to appreciate, let alone imitate, current higher forms of prose literature in the lands they occupied.\n\nLeaving aside the great skill of its translation (which was to serve as the basis for later translations into some forty languages), the work itself is far from primitive, having benefited already at that time 750 CE from a lengthy history of stylistic revision. ''Kalilah and Dimnah'' is in fact the patriarchal form of the Indic fable in which animals behave as humans&nbsp;\u2014 as distinct from the Aesopic fable in which they behave as animals. Its philosophical heroes through the ''initial'' interconnected episodes ''illustrating The Loss of Friends, the first Hindu principle of polity'' are the two jackals, Kalilah and Dimnah.\n\nIt seems unjust, in the light of posterity's appreciation of his work, that Ibn al-Muqaffa was put to death after charges of heresy about 755 CE.}} See also pages 69 \u2013 72 for his vivid summary of Ibn al-Muqaffa's historical context.\n</ref> and \"is considered the first masterpiece of [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary prose]].\"<ref name=\"mitejmes\" /><!-- In the ''The Golden Age of Persia'', [[Richard Nelson Frye]] ascribes significant Arabic literary developments to al-Muqaffa -->\n\nSome scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the second section, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of ''Mitra Laabha'' (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the [[Brethren of Purity]] (''Ikwhan al-Safa'')&nbsp;\u2014 the anonymous 9th-century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity]]'', codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge.

From Arabic it was re-translated into Syriac in the 10th or 11th century, into [[Greek language|Greek]] (as ''Stephanites and Ichnelates'') in 1080 by the Jewish Byzantine doctor [[Simeon Seth]],<ref>L.-O.

This Hebrew version was translated into [[Latin]] by [[John of Capua]] as  ''Directorium Humanae Vitae'', or \"Directory of Human Life\", and printed in 1480, and became the source of most European versions.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bidpai, Fables of|volume=3}}</ref>\nA German translation, ''Das Buch der Beispiele'', of the Panchatantra was printed in 1483, making this one of the earliest books to be printed by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s press after the Bible.<ref name=thane>Vijay Bedekar, [http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm History of the Migration of ''Panchatantra''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820052550/http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm |date=20 August 2012 }}, Institute for Oriental Study, Thane</ref>\n\nThe Latin version was translated into Italian by [[:it:Anton Francesco Doni|Antonfrancesco Doni]] in 1552.

The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake's attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.\n\n==Links with other fables==\nThe fables of ''Panchatantra'' are found in numerous world languages.

Indian painting, 1610.]]\n\nIn the Indian tradition, ''The Panchatantra'' is a {{IAST|n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra}}. ''N\u012bti'' can be roughly translated as \"the wise conduct of life\"<ref name=niti/> and a ''\u015b\u0101stra'' is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are \"the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling\". It draws from the [[Dharma]] [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|and]] [[Artha]] ''\u015b\u0101stra''s, quoting them extensively.<ref name=olivelle18/> It is also explained that ''n\u012bti'' \"represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men\" and that ''n\u012bti'' is \"the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy\".<ref name=niti/>\n\n''The Panchatantra'' shares many stories in common with the Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], purportedly told by the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, \"It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the ''J\u0101taka''s or the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.\"<ref name=olivelle18/> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>Bedekar: \"Its probable relation to early folk and oral tradition of storytelling in India has been suggested by many. Rather, it is fashionable to make such statements that 'Panchatantra' and allied Katha literature in India had their origin in early folk stories. However, not a single credible evidence has been produced till this date, other than lengthy discussions on hypothetical assumptions.\"</ref> In the early 20th century, [[W. Norman Brown]] found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.<ref>[[W. Norman Brown|Brown, Norman W.]] 1919. \"'The Panchatantra' in Modern Indian Folklore\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' Vol 39, pp 1 &17: \"It is doubtless true that in the remote past many stories had their origin among the illiterate folk, often in pre-literary times, and were later taken into literature. It is also just as true that many stories that appear in literature existed there first and are not indebted to the folklore for their origin. But leaving aside questions concerning the early history of Hindu stories and dealing strictly with modern Indian fiction, we find that folklore has frequently taken its material from literature. This process has been so extensive that of the 3000 tales so far reported, all of which have been collected during the past fifty years, at least half can be shown to be derived from literary sources. [...] This table affords considerable evidence in support of the theory that it is the folk tales and not the literary tales that are borrowed.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|left|Panchtantra illustration in Nalanda Temple, 7th century CE (Turtle and the Geese)]]\nAn early Western scholar who studied ''The Panchatantra'' was Dr. [[Johannes Hertel]], who thought the book had a [[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] character. Similarly, Edgerton noted that \"the so-called 'morals' of the stories have no bearing on morality; they are unmoral, and often immoral. They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government.\"<ref name=e1965/> Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching {{IAST|dharma}}, or proper moral conduct.<ref>{{citation | last=Falk|first=H. | title=Quellen des Pa\u00f1catantra | year=1978 | pages=173\u2013188}}</ref> Also:<ref>{{citation | year=1996 | title = Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions | author1=Roderick Hindery | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | isbn=978-81-208-0866-9 | page=166 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-FswBLvTkvQC&pg=PA166&dq=roguery}}</ref>\n{{quote|On the surface, the Pa\u00f1catantra presents stories and sayings which favor the outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue.

The Persian version also makes an abrupt switch from the story of the three sons to an injured ox, and thereafter parallels the ''Panchatantra''.<ref>{{citation | year=1990 | title = Burz\u014dy's voyage to India and the origin of the book of Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah | author1=Fran\u00e7ois de Blois | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-947593-06-3 | pages=22\u201323 with footnotes | url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQ6ysVz89KEC&pg=PA22 }}</ref>\n\nThe two jackals' names transmogrified into Kalila and Dimna in the Persian version. Perhaps because the first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, ''Kalila and Dimna,'' became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.\n\nAfter the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf inserted a new one, telling of Dimna's trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull \u201cShanzabeh\", a key character in the first chapter. The trial lasts for two days without conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He is found guilty and put to death.\n\nIbn al-Muqaffa' inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE \"re-telling\" (see Francois de Blois' Burz\u014dy's voyage to India and the origin of the book ''Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah'').  The political theorist Jennifer London suggests that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa' was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript). London has analysed how Ibn al-Muqaffa' could have used his version to make \"frank political expression\" at the 'Abbasid court (see J. London's \u201cHow To Do Things With Fables: Ibn al-Muqaffa''s Frank Speech in Stories from Kalila wa Dimna,\" ''History of Political Thought'' XXIX: 2 (2008)).\n\n===The Arabic classic by Ibn al-Muqaffa===\n{{See also|Safa Khulusi#Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa.27 and The Arabian_Nights}}\n[[File:Syrischer Maler von 1354 001.jpg|thumb|An illustration from a Syrian edition dated 1354.

It is not quite so strange, however, when one recalls that the Arabs had much preferred the poetic art and were at first suspicious of and untrained to appreciate, let alone imitate, current higher forms of prose literature in the lands they occupied.\n\nLeaving aside the great skill of its translation (which was to serve as the basis for later translations into some forty languages), the work itself is far from primitive, having benefited already at that time 750 CE from a lengthy history of stylistic revision. ''Kalilah and Dimnah'' is in fact the patriarchal form of the Indic fable in which animals behave as humans&nbsp;\u2014 as distinct from the Aesopic fable in which they behave as animals. Its philosophical heroes through the ''initial'' interconnected episodes ''illustrating The Loss of Friends, the first Hindu principle of polity'' are the two jackals, Kalilah and Dimnah.\n\nIt seems unjust, in the light of posterity's appreciation of his work, that Ibn al-Muqaffa was put to death after charges of heresy about 755 CE.}} See also pages 69 \u2013 72 for his vivid summary of Ibn al-Muqaffa's historical context.\n</ref> and \"is considered the first masterpiece of [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary prose]].\"<ref name=\"mitejmes\" /><!-- In the ''The Golden Age of Persia'', [[Richard Nelson Frye]] ascribes significant Arabic literary developments to al-Muqaffa -->\n\nSome scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the second section, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of ''Mitra Laabha'' (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the [[Brethren of Purity]] (''Ikwhan al-Safa'')&nbsp;\u2014 the anonymous 9th-century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity]]'', codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge.

Illustration from the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the [[Latin]] version by [[John of Capua]].]]\n\n===Spread to the rest of Europe===\nAlmost all pre-modern European translations of the Panchatantra arise from this Arabic version. From Arabic it was re-translated into Syriac in the 10th or 11th century, into [[Greek language|Greek]] (as ''Stephanites and Ichnelates'') in 1080 by the Jewish Byzantine doctor [[Simeon Seth]],<ref>L.-O.

This Hebrew version was translated into [[Latin]] by [[John of Capua]] as  ''Directorium Humanae Vitae'', or \"Directory of Human Life\", and printed in 1480, and became the source of most European versions.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bidpai, Fables of|volume=3}}</ref>\nA German translation, ''Das Buch der Beispiele'', of the Panchatantra was printed in 1483, making this one of the earliest books to be printed by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s press after the Bible.<ref name=thane>Vijay Bedekar, [http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm History of the Migration of ''Panchatantra''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820052550/http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm |date=20 August 2012 }}, Institute for Oriental Study, Thane</ref>\n\nThe Latin version was translated into Italian by [[:it:Anton Francesco Doni|Antonfrancesco Doni]] in 1552.
