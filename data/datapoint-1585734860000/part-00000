Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in [[Kathmandu]].\n\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the [[East India Company]] came into conflict with the growing [[Gorkha Kingdom]], culminating in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814\u20131816.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]]. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula's bodyguards and the heroes, Mina's narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker's kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris's [[Bowie knife]].<ref>Stoker, Dacre and Ian Holt (2009).

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces.

The Karda and Chakmak are used as a utility knife and a sharpening tool respectively ]]\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from {{cvt|5|-|10|mm|frac=16}} at the handle, and can taper to {{cvt|2|mm|frac=16}} by the point while the blade lengths can vary from {{cvt|26|-|38|cm}} for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly {{cvt|40|-|45|cm}} in overall length and weighs approximately {{cvt|450|-|900|g|lb|0}}. Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including ''tin Chira'' (triple fuller), ''Dui Chira'' (double fuller), ''Ang Khola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''Gaudi'', ''Kaura'', or ''Cho'') at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 3 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/i/p00jvf2t/ |accessdate=8 August 2013 |series=In the Highest Tradition |last=Wooldridge |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Wooldridge |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=20 November 1989 |time=13 minutes 25 seconds |quote=Here if I may describe, you see a little pattern there, which some people say that it has got some religious significance, but I doubt very much.

The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. {{citation needed|reason=Relief cut for differential tempered edge|date=July 2016}} The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe handles are most often made of [[hardwood]] or [[water buffalo]] horn, but [[ivory]], bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of [[brass]] or steel.\n\nThe traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial [[Tang (tools)|tang]], although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The full tang is mainly used on some military models but has not become widespread in Nepal itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened ''checkmark'' to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a ''karda''. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Gurkha IOC 3.jpg|thumb|200px|A Gurkha officer of the [[Gurkha Contingent]], [[Singapore Police Force]] patrols around [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]] during the [[117th IOC Session]]. He wears the distinctively tilted [[Hat Terrai Gurkha]], the kukri can be seen attached to the back of his belt]]\nThe Biswakarma [[Kami (caste)]] are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making.<ref name=\"kami\">{{Cite web|url=https://himalayan-imports.com/kami.html|title=Kamis, Khukuri makers of Nepal|website=himalayan-imports.com|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> Modern kukri blades are often forged from [[spring steel]], sometimes collected from recycled [[Suspension (vehicle)|truck suspension units]].<ref name=\"kami\"/> The [[tang (tools)|tang]] of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]\n[[File: Khukuri knife and scabbard.jpg|thumb|Kukri knife and scabbard on display at the [[Imperial War Museum North]]]]\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Utility===\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.\n\n==Anatomy==\n===Blade===\n* Keeper (''Hira Jornu''): Spade/Diamond shaped metal/brass plate used to seal the butt cap.\n* Butt Cap (''Chapri''): Thick metal/brass plate used to secure the handle to the tang.\n* Tang (''Paro''): Rear piece of the blade that goes through the handle.\n* Bolster (''Kanjo''): Thick metal/brass round shaped plate between blade and handle made to support and reinforce the fixture.\n* Spine (''Beet''): Thickest blunt edge of the blade.\n* Fuller/Groove (''Khol''): Straight groove or deep line that runs along part of the upper spine.\n* Peak (''Juro''): Highest point of the blade.\n* Main body (''Ang''): Main surface or panel of the blade.\n* Fuller (''Chirra''): Curvature/Hump in the blade made to absorb impact and to reduce unnecessary weight.\n* Tip (''Toppa''): the Starting point of the blade.\n* Edge (''Dhaar''): Sharp edge of the blade.\n* Belly (''Bhundi''): Widest part/area of the blade.\n* Bevel (''Patti''): Slope from the main body until the sharp edge.\n* Notch (''Cho''): A distinctive cut (numeric '3 '-like shape) in the edge.

The Eastern blades are originated and named according to the towns and villages of [[Eastern Nepal]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} The Eastern Khukuris are Angkhola Khukuri, Bhojpure Khukuri, Chainpure Khukuri, Cheetlange (Chitlange) Khukuri, Chirwa (Chiruwa) Khukuri, Dhankute Khukuri, Ganjawla Khukuri, Panawala Khukuri, Sirupate Khukuri translates as ''Siru'' grass leaf like.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kukrimart.com | title=Kukri Mart - Handmade Genuine Gurkhas Knives and original Nepalese Khukuris}}</ref> Khukuris made in locations like [[Chainpur, Kosi|Chainpur]], [[Bhojpur, Nepal|Bhojpur]], and [[Dhankuta]] in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.<ref>Visit Nepal '98: By The Official Travel Manual of Visit Nepal '98 VNY'98 Secretariat, 1998</ref>\nWestern blades are generally broader. Occasionally the Western style is called ''Budhuna'', (referring to a fish with a large head), or ''baspate'' (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal ''Sirupate'' blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.\n\nThere is Khukuri named after Gorkhali General [[Amar Singh Thapa]] called '''Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri'''.

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces.

The Karda and Chakmak are used as a utility knife and a sharpening tool respectively ]]\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from {{cvt|5|-|10|mm|frac=16}} at the handle, and can taper to {{cvt|2|mm|frac=16}} by the point while the blade lengths can vary from {{cvt|26|-|38|cm}} for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly {{cvt|40|-|45|cm}} in overall length and weighs approximately {{cvt|450|-|900|g|lb|0}}. Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including ''tin Chira'' (triple fuller), ''Dui Chira'' (double fuller), ''Ang Khola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''Gaudi'', ''Kaura'', or ''Cho'') at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 3 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/i/p00jvf2t/ |accessdate=8 August 2013 |series=In the Highest Tradition |last=Wooldridge |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Wooldridge |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=20 November 1989 |time=13 minutes 25 seconds |quote=Here if I may describe, you see a little pattern there, which some people say that it has got some religious significance, but I doubt very much.

The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. {{citation needed|reason=Relief cut for differential tempered edge|date=July 2016}} The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe handles are most often made of [[hardwood]] or [[water buffalo]] horn, but [[ivory]], bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of [[brass]] or steel.\n\nThe traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial [[Tang (tools)|tang]], although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The full tang is mainly used on some military models but has not become widespread in Nepal itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened ''checkmark'' to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a ''karda''. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Gurkha IOC 3.jpg|thumb|200px|A Gurkha officer of the [[Gurkha Contingent]], [[Singapore Police Force]] patrols around [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]] during the [[117th IOC Session]].

Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]\n[[File: Khukuri knife and scabbard.jpg|thumb|Kukri knife and scabbard on display at the [[Imperial War Museum North]]]]\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Utility===\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle.

Occasionally the Western style is called ''Budhuna'', (referring to a fish with a large head), or ''baspate'' (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal ''Sirupate'' blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.\n\nThere is Khukuri named after Gorkhali General [[Amar Singh Thapa]] called '''Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri'''.
