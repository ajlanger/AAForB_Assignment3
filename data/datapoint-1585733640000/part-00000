It is famed for its [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] library hall. The abbey was established in the 12th century by the [[Premonstratensian Order]] and made an [[Imperial Abbey]] in the 15th century. The monastery sustained immense damage in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In the 18th century, the abbey began expansions in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], but was unable to complete them. The abbey was secularized in 1803 and twice awarded during the process of [[German Mediatization]], eventually becoming a possession of the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Its second king, [[William I of W\u00fcrttemberg|William I]], opened a [[foundry]] on its grounds, which was followed by a nursing home. These ceased operation or moved out of the monastery in the 1990s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name            = ''Reichskloster Schussenried''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial Abbey of Schussenried\n|status                 = Abbey\n|empire                 = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type        = Principality\n|event_pre              = Abbey founded\n|date_pre               = 1183\n|event_start            = Made [[imperial abbey]]\n|date_start             = 1227\n|event_end              = [[German Mediatisation|Mediatized]] to the County of [[Sternberg-Manderscheid]]\n|date_end               = 1803\n|event_post             = Mediatized to the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_post              = 1806\n|p1                     = County of Waldburg\n|image_p1               = [[File:Wappen Waldburg.svg|20px|alt=]]\n|s1                     = County of Sternberg-Manderscheid\n|image_s1               = [[File:Armoiries d'Erpeldange.svg|20px|alt=]]\n|image_map              = Schussenried Klosteransicht 1721.jpg\n|image_map_caption      = Schussenried Abbey in 1721\n}}\n\nIn 1183, two brothers, Berengar and Konrad von Schussenried, members of the [[House of Hohenstaufen]],{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} donated their holdings \u2013 a castle, some villages, and a parish church{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} \u2013 to the [[Premonstratensian Order]]. The brothers also joined the Order,{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Milestones}} and were themselves joined in the latter half of the year by 12 [[Canon (priest)|canons]] and a [[Provost (religion)|provost]] sent from [[Weissenau Abbey]] to establish a new monastery.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} Construction began soon after, as the provost and Berengar were both laid to rest in the nave of the church of St. Magnus in 1188, and Konrad joined them three years later. A dispute at this time with the {{ill|Barons of Wartenberg|de|Freiherren von Wartenberg}} led to Schussenried's compliment of monks fleeing to Weissenau Abbey, where they sought the aid of [[Pope Celestine III]]. With the help of the [[Bishop of Constance]], an agreement was reached in 1205 that allowed the monks of Schussenried Abbey to return. Six years later, on 13 February 1211, [[Pope Innocent III]] granted Schussenried his protection and guaranteed its immunity.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nWith the abbey properly established and secure, it began to find its footing. In 1227, it was made an [[imperial abbey]], and after 1240 no longer had to recognize a [[vogt]] as its protector. From 1224 to 1253, and even on to 1754, Schussenried Abbey acquired several nearby villages;{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} by the end of the 15th century, the abbey controlled 13 parishes.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}} It also had a seat at [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diets]] by then, and was given the right prosecute [[high justice|high]] and [[blood court|blood]] justice in its borders as early as 1487.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nThe 15th century saw several important developments for the abbey. It received the protection of the [[House of Waldburg]] in 1452, and later that of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In 1482, an entrance hall was added,{{where?|date=March 2020}} with a library along the north side of the [[cloister]].{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nA courthouse was built on the Abbey's grounds in 1513. The Abbey joined the {{ill|Swabian College|de|Schw\u00e4bische Pr\u00e4latenbank}} in 1538.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\n===New Monastery===\nPlans for expansion of the abbey were first suggested by Austrian architect {{ill|Christian Thumb|de}}.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Style History}} This was to replace the monastery as it was rebuilt after the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nOn 20 March 1748, famed Baroque architect [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] submitted a plan for the New Monastery. With that plan came a [[Architectural model|scale model]] with an area of {{convert|110|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|88|cm|in|sp=us}} and removable floors and roofs. His workshop made another model in 1760 of the outer area and its two complexes of workshops.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Baroque Model}} Zimmerman and his brother, [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|Johann Baptist]], had already worked for Schussenried Abbey at {{ill|Sanctuary Church of Our Lady, Steinhausen|de|Wallfahrtskirche Steinhausen|lt=Steinhausen pilgrimage church}} from 1727 to 1733. Zimmermman's plans were accepted, but a local,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Dominikus Zimmermann}} Jakob Emele, was charged with their execution in 1749.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Style History}} Only about a third of Zimmerman's designs were made reality before the monastery ran out of funds in 1763,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Baroque Model}} and the abbot dismissed.{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=233}}\n\nThe 16th century courthouse was replaced with a prison built in 1758.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\n===Secularization===\nIn 1803, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] annexed the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]], and [[German Mediatisation|compensated disadvantaged German princes]] with the territories of smaller states in the former Holy Roman Empire. Among the former were the [[County of Sternberg-Manderscheid|Counts of Sternberg-Manderscheid]], who received the Imperial Abbeys of Schussenried and [[Ochsenhausen Abbey|Ochsenhausen]].{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} Schussenried Abbey was awarded to the County on 25 February 1803, and it became a residence for the Counts of Sternberg-Manderscheid.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} The Counts kept 18 of the 30 monks to look after its grounds, but sold much of the Abbeys' inventory. Three years later, Sternberg-Manderscheid was mediatized into the newly-raised [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]],{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} to whom the Counts sold the Abbey on 1 April 1835.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nIn 1840, King [[William I of W\u00fcrttemberg|William I]] established a [[foundry]] to employ impoverished locals. 30 years later, in 1875, the royal government also established a nursing home on the grounds of the former monastery.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} As such, major renovations took place that removed and replaced many of the abbey buildings.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}} This became the State Psychiatric Hospital of Bad Schussenried, later known as the Center for Psychiatry,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} where [[Gustav Mesmer]] was held until 1949.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Gustav Mesmer}} The hospital moved out of the New Monastery in 1997, and the foundry ceased operation in 1998.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}}\n\n==Grounds and architecture==\n[[Image:Schussenried Kloster Deckengem\u00e4lde Treppenhaus.jpg|thumb|Ceiling painting in stairwell, New Monastery|250px]]\n\nSchussenried Abbey is one of the main sights of the [[Upper Swabian Baroque Route]].{{sfn|Upper Swabian Baroque Route: Kloster Schussenried}}\n\nOriginally, the monastery was divided into an inner area only for monks who had taken their vows, and a generally-accessible outer area. Both were enclosed by a wall and towers. Of those, only the T\u00f6rle, the tower gate into the outer area, remains.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}}\n\nPlans were made in the 18th century to expand and remodel the monastery in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]]. The abbots of Schussenried Abbey regularly visited other Swabian monasteries for ideas for those buildings.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Monastery}}\n\n\"Old Monastery\" refers to the pre-18th century structures (west and south wings, lower gate), and \"New Monastery\" to the Baroque buildings. Many more buildings were planned for the new monastery, but were not built because of deficient finances.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Monastery}} One of those unbuilt buildings was to be a new church, to which the New Monastery would be centered around.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}}\n\nThe founding relic of Schussenried Abbey is a piece of the staff of Saint [[Magnus of F\u00fcssen]]. It is housed in a [[reliquary]] designed and produced by Georg Ignaz Baur.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Staff}}\n\nPremonstratensians from other Swabian monasteries who worked at Schussenried included {{ill|Georg Anton Machein|de}}, who crafted choir stalls for the abbey.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Monastery}}\n\n===Library Hall===\n[[Image:Schussenried Kloster Bibliothekssaal 2.jpg|thumb|Library]]\n\nThe Library Hall is two stories tall, with walls lined with largely decorative bookcases, some containing fold-out desks. The ceiling fresco, by [[Franz Georg Hermann]], depicts in 14 scenes the advance of wisdom and the sciences from the time of the [[Old Testament]] to 1757, when the fresco was completed.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Library Hall}} Examples are [[Hermann of Reichenau]] with a globe,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Herman von Reichenau}} beneath {{ill|Caspar Mohr|de|Kaspar Mohr}}, a Premonstratensian monk and polymath who tried to fly,{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Caspar Mohr}} and the meeting of [[Louis XIV of France]] and Nikolaus Wierith, the abbot of [[Marchtal Abbey]], whom Louis dubbed \"Solomon II\".{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Abbot with the Sun King}} The sculptures were finished in 1766 by {{ill|Fidelis Sporer|de}}.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Library Hall}}\n\nAfter the secularization of the abbey, the Library Hall became a church and concert hall. An [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the hall at the end of the 19th century.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Library Hall}}\n\nOne of the rooms in the Library Hall is a gallery, the Four Elements, which depict the [[four elements]] via four scientific tools and eight techniques of the 18th century. Earth is represented by a globe, water by buckets, wheels, and pulleys, and [[Watermill|mills]], fire by the use of a mirror and sunlight to burn wood, and air by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] wielding a [[trident]].{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Four Elements}}\n\n===Abbey church===\n[[File:Bad Schussenried 04 2011 01.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of St. Magnus's Church]]\n\nThe {{ill|St. Magnus's Church, Bad Schussenried|de|St. Magnus (Bad Schussenried)|lt=abbey church}} is now the parish church, dedicated to Saint Magnus.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Staff}} It was built in 1229 in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]],{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Church}} with three [[aisles]] but no [[transept]]. It was dedicated at first to the Virgin Mary, but St. Magnus was added to the dedication in 1366.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}} From 1493 to 1498,{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} the church was reconstructed in the [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic fashion]]. Seven chapels and [[winged altarpiece]]s by [[Bernhard Strigel]] were added,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}} as was a porch, in 1482, and new a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] with pointed arches in 1494. The [[bell tower]] had also been modified with a tall [[steeple]], replaced with an [[onion dome]] in 1692.{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Style History}} The church was once again remodeled in the 18th century in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]].{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}} The original, flat ceiling was replaced with a vaulted one, round windows installed, and the preceding Romanesque and Gothic embellishments covered with stucco. This work revealed that [[bricks]] had been used in the previous renovation, making it some of the oldest brickwork in Upper Swabia.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Church}}\n\nThe ceiling fresco was painted in 1745\u201346 by [[Johannes Zick]] and depicts the life of Saint [[Norbert of Xanten]], founder of the Premonstratensian Order, in 14 scenes. The choir stalls are similarly decorated with images of the 24 saints revered by the Premonstratensians and the [[Passion of Christ]]. They were created from 1715 to 1717 by Georg Anton Macheln from [[Tilia#Wood|linden]], for the images, and [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]], for the seats.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Church}}\n\n===Museum and exhibits===\nThe primary museum, the Klostermuseum,{{where?|date=February 2020}} is divided into three parts. The first section documents the worldly role played by Schussenried Abbey during its monastic operation. Part of this exhibit are the models of the planned New Monastery constructed by architects Zimmerman and Emele. The second focuses on three aspects of monastic life \u2013 pilgrimage, [[Mariology]], and popular piety, all demonstrated with the abbey's sponsoring of a {{ill|Sanctuary Church of Our Lady, Steinhausen|de|Wallfahrtskirche Steinhausen|lt=nearby pilgrimage church}}. Finally, the third section documents the role of education and the sciences at Schussenried and other Swabian monasteries in the 18th century.{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Museums}}\n\n==See

It is famed for its [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] library hall. The abbey was established in the 12th century by the [[Premonstratensian Order]] and made an [[Imperial Abbey]] in the 15th century. The monastery sustained immense damage in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In the 18th century, the abbey began expansions in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], but was unable to complete them. The abbey was secularized in 1803 and twice awarded during the process of [[German Mediatization]], eventually becoming a possession of the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Its second king, [[William I of W\u00fcrttemberg|William I]], opened a [[foundry]] on its grounds, which was followed by a nursing home. These ceased operation or moved out of the monastery in the 1990s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name            = ''Reichskloster Schussenried''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial Abbey of Schussenried\n|status                 = Abbey\n|empire                 = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type        = Principality\n|event_pre              = Abbey founded\n|date_pre               = 1183\n|event_start            = Made [[imperial abbey]]\n|date_start             = 1227\n|event_end              = [[German Mediatisation|Mediatized]] to the County of [[Sternberg-Manderscheid]]\n|date_end               = 1803\n|event_post             = Mediatized to the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_post              = 1806\n|p1                     = County of Waldburg\n|image_p1               = [[File:Wappen Waldburg.svg|20px|alt=]]\n|s1                     = County of Sternberg-Manderscheid\n|image_s1               = [[File:Armoiries d'Erpeldange.svg|20px|alt=]]\n|image_map              = Schussenried Klosteransicht 1721.jpg\n|image_map_caption      = Schussenried Abbey in 1721\n}}\n\nIn 1183, two brothers, Berengar and Konrad von Schussenried, members of the [[House of Hohenstaufen]],{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} donated their holdings \u2013 a castle, some villages, and a parish church{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} \u2013 to the [[Premonstratensian Order]]. The brothers also joined the Order,{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Milestones}} and were themselves joined in the latter half of the year by 12 [[Canon (priest)|canons]] and a [[Provost (religion)|provost]] sent from [[Weissenau Abbey]] to establish a new monastery.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} Construction began soon after, as the provost and Berengar were both laid to rest in the nave of the church of St. Magnus in 1188, and Konrad joined them three years later. A dispute at this time with the {{ill|Barons of Wartenberg|de|Freiherren von Wartenberg}} led to Schussenried's compliment of monks fleeing to Weissenau Abbey, where they sought the aid of [[Pope Celestine III]]. With the help of the [[Bishop of Constance]], an agreement was reached in 1205 that allowed the monks of Schussenried Abbey to return. Six years later, on 13 February 1211, [[Pope Innocent III]] granted Schussenried his protection and guaranteed its immunity.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nWith the abbey properly established and secure, it began to find its footing. In 1227, it was made an [[imperial abbey]], and after 1240 no longer had to recognize a [[vogt]] as its protector. From 1224 to 1253, and even on to 1754, Schussenried Abbey acquired several nearby villages;{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} by the end of the 15th century, the abbey controlled 13 parishes.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}} It also had a seat at [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diets]] by then, and was given the right prosecute [[high justice|high]] and [[blood court|blood]] justice in its borders as early as 1487.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nThe 15th century saw several important developments for the abbey. It received the protection of the [[House of Waldburg]] in 1452, and later that of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In 1482, an entrance hall was added,{{where?|date=March 2020}} with a library along the north side of the [[cloister]].{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nA courthouse was built on the Abbey's grounds in 1513. The Abbey joined the {{ill|Swabian College|de|Schw\u00e4bische Pr\u00e4latenbank}} in 1538.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\n===New Monastery===\nPlans for expansion of the abbey were first suggested by Austrian architect {{ill|Christian Thumb|de}}.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Style History}} This was to replace the monastery as it was rebuilt after the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nOn 20 March 1748, famed Baroque architect [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] submitted a plan for the New Monastery. With that plan came a [[Architectural model|scale model]] with an area of {{convert|110|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|88|cm|in|sp=us}} and removable floors and roofs. His workshop made another model in 1760 of the outer area and its two complexes of workshops.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Baroque Model}} Zimmerman and his brother, [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|Johann Baptist]], had already worked for Schussenried Abbey at {{ill|Sanctuary Church of Our Lady, Steinhausen|de|Wallfahrtskirche Steinhausen|lt=Steinhausen pilgrimage church}} from 1727 to 1733. Zimmermman's plans were accepted, but a local,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Dominikus Zimmermann}} Jakob Emele, was charged with their execution in 1749.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Style History}} Only about a third of Zimmerman's designs were made reality before the monastery ran out of funds in 1763,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Baroque Model}} and the abbot dismissed.{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=233}}\n\nThe 16th century courthouse was replaced with a prison built in 1758.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\n===Secularization===\nIn 1803, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] annexed the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]], and [[German Mediatisation|compensated disadvantaged German princes]] with the territories of smaller states in the former Holy Roman Empire. Among the former were the [[County of Sternberg-Manderscheid|Counts of Sternberg-Manderscheid]], who received the Imperial Abbeys of Schussenried and [[Ochsenhausen Abbey|Ochsenhausen]].{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} Schussenried Abbey was awarded to the County on 25 February 1803, and it became a residence for the Counts of Sternberg-Manderscheid.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} The Counts kept 18 of the 30 monks to look after its grounds, but sold much of the Abbeys' inventory. Three years later, Sternberg-Manderscheid was mediatized into the newly-raised [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]],{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} to whom the Counts sold the Abbey on 1 April 1835.{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}}\n\nIn 1840, King [[William I of W\u00fcrttemberg|William I]] established a [[foundry]] to employ impoverished locals. 30 years later, in 1875, the royal government also established a nursing home on the grounds of the former monastery.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} As such, major renovations took place that removed and replaced many of the abbey buildings.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}} This became the State Psychiatric Hospital of Bad Schussenried, later known as the Center for Psychiatry,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}} where [[Gustav Mesmer]] was held until 1949.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Gustav Mesmer}} The hospital moved out of the New Monastery in 1997, and the foundry ceased operation in 1998.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Secularization}}\n\n==Grounds and architecture==\n[[Image:Schussenried Kloster Deckengem\u00e4lde Treppenhaus.jpg|thumb|Ceiling painting in stairwell, New Monastery|250px]]\n\nSchussenried Abbey is one of the main sights of the [[Upper Swabian Baroque Route]].{{sfn|Upper Swabian Baroque Route: Kloster Schussenried}}\n\nOriginally, the monastery was divided into an inner area only for monks who had taken their vows, and a generally-accessible outer area. Both were enclosed by a wall and towers. Of those, only the T\u00f6rle, the tower gate into the outer area, remains.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}}\n\nPlans were made in the 18th century to expand and remodel the monastery in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]]. The abbots of Schussenried Abbey regularly visited other Swabian monasteries for ideas for those buildings.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Monastery}}\n\n\"Old Monastery\" refers to the pre-18th century structures (west and south wings, lower gate), and \"New Monastery\" to the Baroque buildings. Many more buildings were planned for the new monastery, but were not built because of deficient finances.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Monastery}} One of those unbuilt buildings was to be a new church, to which the New Monastery would be centered around.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}}\n\nThe founding relic of Schussenried Abbey is a piece of the staff of Saint [[Magnus of F\u00fcssen]]. It is housed in a [[reliquary]] designed and produced by Georg Ignaz Baur.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Staff}}\n\nPremonstratensians from other Swabian monasteries who worked at Schussenried included {{ill|Georg Anton Machein|de}}, who crafted choir stalls for the abbey.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Monastery}}\n\n===Library Hall===\n[[Image:Schussenried Kloster Bibliothekssaal 2.jpg|thumb|Library]]\n\nThe Library Hall is two stories tall, with walls lined with largely decorative bookcases, some containing fold-out desks. The ceiling fresco, by [[Franz Georg Hermann]], depicts in 14 scenes the advance of wisdom and the sciences from the time of the [[Old Testament]] to 1757, when the fresco was completed.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Library Hall}} Examples are [[Hermann of Reichenau]] with a globe,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Herman von Reichenau}} beneath {{ill|Caspar Mohr|de|Kaspar Mohr}}, a Premonstratensian monk and polymath who tried to fly,{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Caspar Mohr}} and the meeting of [[Louis XIV of France]] and Nikolaus Wierith, the abbot of [[Marchtal Abbey]], whom Louis dubbed \"Solomon II\".{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Abbot with the Sun King}} The sculptures were finished in 1766 by {{ill|Fidelis Sporer|de}}.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Library Hall}}\n\nAfter the secularization of the abbey, the Library Hall became a church and concert hall. An [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the hall at the end of the 19th century.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Library Hall}}\n\nOne of the rooms in the Library Hall is a gallery, the Four Elements, which depict the [[four elements]] via four scientific tools and eight techniques of the 18th century. Earth is represented by a globe, water by buckets, wheels, and pulleys, and [[Watermill|mills]], fire by the use of a mirror and sunlight to burn wood, and air by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] wielding a [[trident]].{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Four Elements}}\n\n===Abbey church===\n[[File:Bad Schussenried 04 2011 01.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of St. Magnus's Church]]\n\nThe {{ill|St. Magnus's Church, Bad Schussenried|de|St. Magnus (Bad Schussenried)|lt=abbey church}} is now the parish church, dedicated to Saint Magnus.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Staff}} It was built in 1229 in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]],{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Church}} with three [[aisles]] but no [[transept]]. It was dedicated at first to the Virgin Mary, but St. Magnus was added to the dedication in 1366.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Schussenried}} From 1493 to 1498,{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Schussenried}} the church was reconstructed in the [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic fashion]]. Seven chapels and [[winged altarpiece]]s by [[Bernhard Strigel]] were added,{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}} as was a porch, in 1482, and new a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] with pointed arches in 1494. The [[bell tower]] had also been modified with a tall [[steeple]], replaced with an [[onion dome]] in 1692.{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Style History}} The church was once again remodeled in the 18th century in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]].{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Buildings}} The original, flat ceiling was replaced with a vaulted one, round windows installed, and the preceding Romanesque and Gothic embellishments covered with stucco. This work revealed that [[bricks]] had been used in the previous renovation, making it some of the oldest brickwork in Upper Swabia.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Church}}\n\nThe ceiling fresco was painted in 1745\u201346 by [[Johannes Zick]] and depicts the life of Saint [[Norbert of Xanten]], founder of the Premonstratensian Order, in 14 scenes. The choir stalls are similarly decorated with images of the 24 saints revered by the Premonstratensians and the [[Passion of Christ]]. They were created from 1715 to 1717 by Georg Anton Macheln from [[Tilia#Wood|linden]], for the images, and [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]], for the seats.{{sfn|Schussenried Abbey: St. Magnus's Church}}\n\n===Museum and exhibits===\nThe primary museum, the Klostermuseum,{{where?|date=February 2020}} is divided into three parts. The first section documents the worldly role played by Schussenried Abbey during its monastic operation. Part of this exhibit are the models of the planned New Monastery constructed by architects Zimmerman and Emele. The second focuses on three aspects of monastic life \u2013 pilgrimage, [[Mariology]], and popular piety, all demonstrated with the abbey's sponsoring of a {{ill|Sanctuary Church of Our Lady, Steinhausen|de|Wallfahrtskirche Steinhausen|lt=nearby pilgrimage church}}. Finally, the third section documents the role of education and the sciences at Schussenried and other Swabian monasteries in the 18th century.{{Sfn|Schussenried Abbey: Museums}}\n\n==See
