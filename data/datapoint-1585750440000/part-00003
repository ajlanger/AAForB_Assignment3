Later, around 530, [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]] would arrange the weekly order of monastic psalmody in his ''[[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]]''. Later, in the 6th century, [[Venantius Fortunatus]] created some of Christianity's most enduring hymns, including \"[[Vexilla regis|Vexilla regis prodeunt]]\" which would later become the most popular hymn of the [[Crusades]].{{sfn|McKinnon|1991|pp=318\u2013320}}\n\n[[File:Guidonian hand.jpg|thumb|The Guidonian Hand]]\nThe earliest extant music in the West is ''[[plainsong]]'',{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=27}} a kind of [[texture (music)|monophonic]], unaccompanied, early Christian singing performed by Roman Catholic monks, which was largely developed roughly between the 7th and 12th centuries. Although [[Gregorian chant]] has its roots in Roman chant and is popularly associated with Rome, it is not indigenous to Italy, nor was it the earliest nor the only Western plainchant tradition. Ireland, Spain, and France each developed a local plainchant tradition, but only in Italy did several chant traditions thrive simultaneously: [[Ambrosian chant]] in [[Milan]], [[Old Roman chant]] in [[Rome]], and [[Beneventan chant]] in [[Benevento]] and [[Montecassino]]. Gregorian chant, which supplanted the indigenous Old Roman and Beneventan traditions, derived from a synthesis of Roman and [[Gallican chant]] in [[Carolingian]] France. Gregorian chant later came to be strongly identified with Rome, especially as musical elements from the north were added to the [[Roman Rite]], such as the [[Credo]] in 1014. This was part of a general trend wherein the manuscript tradition in Italy weakened and Rome began to follow northern plainchant traditions. Gregorian chant supplanted all the other Western plainchant traditions, Italian and non-Italian, except for Ambrosian chant, which survives to this day. The native Italian plainchant traditions are notable for a systematic use of ornate, [[steps and skips|stepwise]] melodic motion within a generally narrower range, giving the Italian chant traditions a smoother, more undulating feel than the Gregorian.{{sfn|Hiley|1995|p=546}} Crucial in the transmission of chant were the innovations of [[Guido d'Arezzo]], whose ''Micrologus'', written around 1020, described the [[musical staff]], [[solmization]], and the [[Guidonian hand]]. This early form of do-re-mi created a technical revolution in the speed at which chants could be learned, memorized, and recorded. Much of the European classical musical tradition, including [[opera]] and [[symphony|symphonic]] and [[chamber music]] can be traced back to these Italian medieval developments in [[musical notation]],{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=33}} formal [[music education]] and construction techniques for [[musical instrument]]s.\n\nEven as the northern chant traditions were displacing indigenous Italian chant, displaced musicians from the north contributed to a new thriving musical culture in 12th-century Italy. The [[Albigensian Crusade]], supposedly to attack Cathar heretics, brought southern France under northern French control and crushed Occitan culture and language. Most [[troubadour]]s fled, especially to Spain and Italy. Italy developed its own counterparts to troubadours, called ''trovatori'', including [[Sordello]] of [[Mantua]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the last great [[Hohenstaufen]] Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, encouraged music at the Sicilian court, which became a refuge for these displaced troubadours, where they contributed to a melting pot of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim musical styles. Italian secular music was largely the province of these jongleurs, troubadors, and mimes.{{sfn|Gallo|1995|p={{page needed|date=December 2018}}}} One important consequence of the troubadour influence during this period, in Italy and across Europe, was the gradual shift from writing strictly in [[Latin language|Latin]] to the local language, as championed by [[Dante]] in his treatise ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]''; this development extended to the lyrics of popular songs and forms such as the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]],{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=185}} meaning \"in the mother tongue.\" Also around this time, Italian [[flagellant]]s developed the Italian folk hymns known as spiritual [[lauda (song)|laude]].\n\nBetween 1317 and 1319, [[Marchetto da Padova|Marchettus of Padua]] wrote the ''Lucidarium in artae musicae planae'' and the ''Pomerium artis musicae mensuratae'', major treatises on [[plainchant]] and [[polyphony]], expounding a theory of rhythmic notation that paved the way for [[music of the Trecento|Trecento music]] (Italian ''[[ars nova]]''). Around 1335, the ''[[Rossi Codex]]'', the earliest extant collection of Italian secular polyphony, included examples of indigenous Italian genres of the [[Trecento]] including early ''[[Madrigal (Trecento)|madrigal]]s'', ''[[Caccia (music)|cacce]]'', and ''[[ballata|ballate]]''. The early madrigal was simpler than the more well-known later madrigals, usually consisting of tercets arranged polyphonically for two voices, with a refrain called a ''ritornello''. The caccia was often in three-part harmony, with the top two lines set to words in musical canon. The early ballata was often a poem in the form of a [[virelai]] set to a [[monophony|monophonic]] melody.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=438}} The Rossi Codex included music by [[Jacopo da Bologna]], the first famous Trecento composer.\n\nThe ''Ivrea Codex'', dated around 1360, and the ''[[Squarcialupi Codex]]'', dated around 1410, were major sources of late Trecento music, including the music of [[Francesco Landini]], the famous blind composer. Landini's name was attached to his characteristic \"[[Landini cadence]]\" in which the final note of the melody dips down two notes before returning, such as C\u2013B\u2013A\u2013C. Trecento music influenced northern musicians such as [[Johannes Ciconia]], whose synthesis of the French and Italian styles presaged the \"international\" music typical of the Renaissance.\n\nDuring the 15th century, Italy entered a slow period in native composition, with the exception of a few bright lights such as the performer and anthologist Leonardo Giustinian. As the powerful northern families such as the [[d'Este]] and [[Medici]] built up powerful political dynasties, they brought northern composers of the [[Dutch school (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school such as [[Josquin]] and [[Loyset Comp\u00e8re|Comp\u00e8re]] to their courts. Starting in the last decades of the century, Italian composers such as [[Marchetto Cara]] and [[Bartolomeo Tromboncino]] wrote light, courtly songs called ''[[frottola|frottole]]'' for the [[Mantua]]n court of [[Isabella d'Este]]. With the support of the Medici, the [[Florence|Florentine]] Mardi Gras season led to the creation of witty, earthy carnival songs called ''canti carnascialeschi''.\n\n== Renaissance era, 16th century ==\n{{details|Roman School|Venetian School (music)|Venetian polychoral style|Music of Venice}}\n\n[[File:San Marco (evening view).jpg|left|thumb|300px|Saint Mark's in Venice. The spacious, resonant interior was one of the inspirations for the music of the Venetian School.]]\nThe 16th century saw the advent of printed polyphonic music and advances in instrumental music, which contributed to the international distribution of music characteristic of the Renaissance. In 1501, [[Ottaviano dei Petrucci]] published the ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', the first substantial collection of printed polyphonic music, and in 1516, Andrea Antico published the ''Frottole intablate da sonari organi'', the earliest printed Italian music for keyboard. Italy became the primary center of harpsichord construction, violin production started in [[Cremona]] in the workshop of [[Andrea Amati]], and lutenist Francesco Canova da Milano earned Italy an international reputation for virtuosic musicianship.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=494}}\n\n[[File:Gesualdo2.jpg|upright|thumb|Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa]]\nMusic achieved new heights of cultural respectability. [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' recommended proficiency at music as a courtly virtue, and ''Santa Maria di Loreto'', the first music conservatory, was built in [[Naples]]. [[Adrian Willaert]] developed music for double chorus at [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Mark's]] in [[Venice]]. This tradition of Venetian polychoral music would reach its height in the early baroque music of [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]. Unlike the earlier, simpler madrigals of the [[Trecento]], madrigals of the 16th century were written for several voices, often by non-Italians brought into the wealthy northern courts. Madrigalists aspired to create high art, often using the refined poetry of [[Petrarchan sonnet]]s, and utilizing musically sophisticated techniques such as text painting. Composers such as [[Cipriano de Rore]] and [[Orlando di Lasso]] experimented with increasing [[chromaticism]], which would culminate in the [[mannerist]] music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]]. In 1558, [[Gioseffo Zarlino]], the premier musical theorist of the period, wrote the ''Istitutioni harmoniche'', which addressed such practical musical issues as invertible [[counterpoint]]. Lighter music was represented by the ''[[villanella]]'', which originated in popular songs of [[Naples]] and spread throughout Italy.\n\nMusic was not immune to the politically charged atmosphere of Renaissance Italy. In 1559, Antonio Gardano published ''Musica nova'', whose politically pro-republican partisan songs pleased the northern Italian republics and riled the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=406}} In 1562/1563, the third portion of the [[Council of Trent]] addressed issues of music in the Church. Most paraliturgical music, including all but four [[Sequence (poetry)|Sequence]]s were banned. An outright ban on polyphonic music was debated behind the scenes, and guidelines were issued requiring that church music have clear words and a pure, uplifting style. Although the tales of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] \"rescuing\" polyphony with the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars, Palestrina's music remains the paradigm of the musical aesthetic promoted by the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=583}} Shortly afterwards, in 1614, the ''Editio medicea'' (Medicean Edition) of Gregorian chant was released, rewriting the Gregorian chant repertory to purge it of perceived corruptions and barbarisms, and return it to a \"purer\" state closer in style to Palestrinian melodies.\n\nIn the late 16th century and early 17th century, composers began pushing the limits of the Renaissance style. Madrigalism reached new heights of emotional expression and chromaticism in what [[Claudio Monteverdi]] called his ''seconda pratica'' (second practice), which he saw originating with [[Cipriano de Rore]] and developing in the music of composers such as [[Luca Marenzio]] and [[Giaches de Wert]]. This music was characterized by increased dissonance and by sections of [[homophony]], which led to such traits of the early baroque as unequal voices where the bass line drove the harmonies and the treble melody became more prominent and soloistic. This transitional period between the Renaissance and baroque included the development of the Sicilian polyphonic school in the works of Pietro Vinci, the first extant polyphony written by women, the fusion of Hebrew texts and European music in the works of [[Salomone Rossi]], and the virtuosic women's music of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] performed by the [[Concerto delle donne]] in [[Ferrara]].\n\n== Baroque era, 16th &ndash; 18th centuries ==\n\n[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Claudio Monteverdi]]\nThe exact nature of [[Ancient Greek music|ancient Greek musical drama]] is a matter of dispute. What is important, however, for the later development of Italian and European music is that poets and musicians of the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the late 16th century thought\u2014in the words of one of them, [[Jacopo Peri]]\u2014that the \"ancient Greeks sang entire tragedies on the stage\".{{sfn|Paliska|1985|p=408}} Thus was born the musical version of the Italian Renaissance: paying tribute to [[History of Greece|classical Greece]] by retelling Greek myths within a staged musical context\u2014the first operas. The works emerged in this period with relatively simple melodies and the texts about Greek mythology sung in Italian. (Opera may have deeper roots in the Tuscan ''[[maggio drammatico]]'' tradition.<ref>Lomax, p. 126. {{incomplete short citation|date=December 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Magrini|1992|p={{page number needed|date=December 2018}}}} Three cities are especially important in this period in Italy: [[Venice]], as the birthplace of commercial opera; [[Rome]], for [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s school of [[Renaissance]] polyphony; and [[Naples]], as the birthplace of church-sponsored [[Music Conservatories of Naples|music conservatories]]. These conservatories evolved into training grounds, providing composers and musicians for Italy and, indeed, Europe as a whole. [[Claudio Monteverdi]] is considered the first great composer of the new musical form, opera, the person who turned Florentine novelty into a \"unified musical drama with a planned structure.\"{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=220}}\n\nThe years 1600 to 1750 encompass the [[Baroque music|musical Baroque]]. A new dominance of melody within harmony at the expense of text led to great changes, including the expansion of instrumental resources of the orchestra. The keyboard was extended, and the making of stringed instruments by [[Antonio Stradivari]] became a great industry in [[Cremona]]. Instrumental music started to develop as a separate \"track,\" quite apart from the traditional role of accompanying the human voice. Instrumental forms include such things as the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]]. Important names in music within this period in Italy are [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], representing the importance of Naples and Venice, respectively, within this period.\n\n[[File:Napoli - Teatro San CarlodaViaSanCarlo.jpg|thumb|Teatro San Carlo, Naples]]\nThe physical resources for music advanced greatly during the 18th century. The great opera houses in Naples and Milan were built: the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and [[La Scala]], respectively. It is the age, as well, of the rise to prominence of the Neapolitan\u2014and then Italian\u2014[[Comic opera]]. Important, too, is the restoring of balance between text and music in opera, largely through the librettos of Pietro Trapassi, called [[Metastasio]].{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=341}}\n\nImportant Italian composers in this century are: [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Benedetto Marcello]], [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], and [[Luigi Cherubini]]. It is also the age in which Italian music became international, so to speak, with many Italian composers beginning to work abroad.\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi]]\n\n== 19th century ==\n\nThe 19th century is the age of Romanticism in European literature, art, and music. Italian opera forsakes the [[Comic opera]] for the more  the generally light-hearted and ever-popular [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] was certainly an exception to that, Italian music of the 19th century is dominated at the beginning by the likes of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], giving to Italian music the lyrical melodies that have remained associated with it ever since. Then, the last fifty years of the century were dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], the greatest musical icon in Italian history. Verdi's music \"sought universality within national character\";{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=473}} that is, much of what he composed in terms of historical themes could be related to his pan-Italian vision. Verdi was the composer of the Italian [[Risorgimento]], the movement to unify Italy in the 19th century. Later in the century is also the time of the early career of [[Giacomo Puccini]], perhaps the greatest composer of pure melody in the history of Italian music.\n\n[[File:cavrust.jpg|right|thumb|Frontispiece from the score of ''Cavalleria rusticana'', a masterpiece of Italian ''Verismo'' from 1890]]\nPerhaps the most noteworthy feature of Italian musical form in the 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost to the exclusion of other forms, such as the symphony.{{sfn|Crocker|1966|loc=ch. 13}} There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a ''Stabat Mater'' and his late ''[[Petite messe solennelle]]'' and Verdi ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Messa da Requiem]]'' and ''[[Quattro pezzi sacri]]''.\n\nRomanticism in all European music certainly held on through the start of the 20th century. In Italy, the music of Verdi and Puccini continued to dominate for a number of years. Even the realistic plots and more modern compositional techniques of the operas of Italian [[verismo]], such as [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', did not greatly affect the extremely melodic nature of Italian music.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n|first     = Allan W.\n|last      = Atlas\n|title     = Renaissance Music\n|publisher = W.

Unlike the earlier, simpler madrigals of the [[Trecento]], madrigals of the 16th century were written for several voices, often by non-Italians brought into the wealthy northern courts. Madrigalists aspired to create high art, often using the refined poetry of [[Petrarchan sonnet]]s, and utilizing musically sophisticated techniques such as text painting. Composers such as [[Cipriano de Rore]] and [[Orlando di Lasso]] experimented with increasing [[chromaticism]], which would culminate in the [[mannerist]] music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]]. In 1558, [[Gioseffo Zarlino]], the premier musical theorist of the period, wrote the ''Istitutioni harmoniche'', which addressed such practical musical issues as invertible [[counterpoint]]. Lighter music was represented by the ''[[villanella]]'', which originated in popular songs of [[Naples]] and spread throughout Italy.\n\nMusic was not immune to the politically charged atmosphere of Renaissance Italy. In 1559, Antonio Gardano published ''Musica nova'', whose politically pro-republican partisan songs pleased the northern Italian republics and riled the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=406}} In 1562/1563, the third portion of the [[Council of Trent]] addressed issues of music in the Church. Most paraliturgical music, including all but four [[Sequence (poetry)|Sequence]]s were banned. An outright ban on polyphonic music was debated behind the scenes, and guidelines were issued requiring that church music have clear words and a pure, uplifting style. Although the tales of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] \"rescuing\" polyphony with the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars, Palestrina's music remains the paradigm of the musical aesthetic promoted by the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=583}} Shortly afterwards, in 1614, the ''Editio medicea'' (Medicean Edition) of Gregorian chant was released, rewriting the Gregorian chant repertory to purge it of perceived corruptions and barbarisms, and return it to a \"purer\" state closer in style to Palestrinian melodies.\n\nIn the late 16th century and early 17th century, composers began pushing the limits of the Renaissance style. Madrigalism reached new heights of emotional expression and chromaticism in what [[Claudio Monteverdi]] called his ''seconda pratica'' (second practice), which he saw originating with [[Cipriano de Rore]] and developing in the music of composers such as [[Luca Marenzio]] and [[Giaches de Wert]]. This music was characterized by increased dissonance and by sections of [[homophony]], which led to such traits of the early baroque as unequal voices where the bass line drove the harmonies and the treble melody became more prominent and soloistic. This transitional period between the Renaissance and baroque included the development of the Sicilian polyphonic school in the works of Pietro Vinci, the first extant polyphony written by women, the fusion of Hebrew texts and European music in the works of [[Salomone Rossi]], and the virtuosic women's music of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] performed by the [[Concerto delle donne]] in [[Ferrara]].\n\n== Baroque era, 16th &ndash; 18th centuries ==\n\n[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Claudio Monteverdi]]\nThe exact nature of [[Ancient Greek music|ancient Greek musical drama]] is a matter of dispute. What is important, however, for the later development of Italian and European music is that poets and musicians of the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the late 16th century thought\u2014in the words of one of them, [[Jacopo Peri]]\u2014that the \"ancient Greeks sang entire tragedies on the stage\".{{sfn|Paliska|1985|p=408}} Thus was born the musical version of the Italian Renaissance: paying tribute to [[History of Greece|classical Greece]] by retelling Greek myths within a staged musical context\u2014the first operas. The works emerged in this period with relatively simple melodies and the texts about Greek mythology sung in Italian. (Opera may have deeper roots in the Tuscan ''[[maggio drammatico]]'' tradition.<ref>Lomax, p. 126. {{incomplete short citation|date=December 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Magrini|1992|p={{page number needed|date=December 2018}}}} Three cities are especially important in this period in Italy: [[Venice]], as the birthplace of commercial opera; [[Rome]], for [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s school of [[Renaissance]] polyphony; and [[Naples]], as the birthplace of church-sponsored [[Music Conservatories of Naples|music conservatories]]. These conservatories evolved into training grounds, providing composers and musicians for Italy and, indeed, Europe as a whole. [[Claudio Monteverdi]] is considered the first great composer of the new musical form, opera, the person who turned Florentine novelty into a \"unified musical drama with a planned structure.\"{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=220}}\n\nThe years 1600 to 1750 encompass the [[Baroque music|musical Baroque]]. A new dominance of melody within harmony at the expense of text led to great changes, including the expansion of instrumental resources of the orchestra. The keyboard was extended, and the making of stringed instruments by [[Antonio Stradivari]] became a great industry in [[Cremona]]. Instrumental music started to develop as a separate \"track,\" quite apart from the traditional role of accompanying the human voice. Instrumental forms include such things as the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]]. Important names in music within this period in Italy are [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], representing the importance of Naples and Venice, respectively, within this period.\n\n[[File:Napoli - Teatro San CarlodaViaSanCarlo.jpg|thumb|Teatro San Carlo, Naples]]\nThe physical resources for music advanced greatly during the 18th century. The great opera houses in Naples and Milan were built: the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and [[La Scala]], respectively. It is the age, as well, of the rise to prominence of the Neapolitan\u2014and then Italian\u2014[[Comic opera]]. Important, too, is the restoring of balance between text and music in opera, largely through the librettos of Pietro Trapassi, called [[Metastasio]].{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=341}}\n\nImportant Italian composers in this century are: [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Benedetto Marcello]], [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], and [[Luigi Cherubini]]. It is also the age in which Italian music became international, so to speak, with many Italian composers beginning to work abroad.\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi]]\n\n== 19th century ==\n\nThe 19th century is the age of Romanticism in European literature, art, and music. Italian opera forsakes the [[Comic opera]] for the more serious fare of Italian lyric Romanticism. Although the generally light-hearted and ever-popular [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] was certainly an exception to that, Italian music of the 19th century is dominated at the beginning by the likes of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], giving to Italian music the lyrical melodies that have remained associated with it ever since. Then, the last fifty years of the century were dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], the greatest musical icon in Italian history. Verdi's music \"sought universality within national character\";{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=473}} that is, much of what he composed in terms of historical themes could be related to his pan-Italian vision. Verdi was the composer of the Italian [[Risorgimento]], the movement to unify Italy in the 19th century. Later in the century is also the time of the early career of [[Giacomo Puccini]], perhaps the greatest composer of pure melody in the history of Italian music.\n\n[[File:cavrust.jpg|right|thumb|Frontispiece from the score of ''Cavalleria rusticana'', a masterpiece of Italian ''Verismo'' from 1890]]\nPerhaps the most noteworthy feature of Italian musical form in the 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost to the exclusion of other forms, such as the symphony.{{sfn|Crocker|1966|loc=ch. 13}} There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a ''Stabat Mater'' and his late ''[[Petite messe solennelle]]'' and Verdi ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Messa da Requiem]]'' and ''[[Quattro pezzi sacri]]''.\n\nRomanticism in all European music certainly held on through the start of the 20th century. In Italy, the music of Verdi and Puccini continued to dominate for a number of years. Even the realistic plots and more modern compositional techniques of the operas of Italian [[verismo]], such as [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', did not greatly affect the extremely melodic nature of Italian music.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n|first     = Allan W.\n|last      = Atlas\n|title     = Renaissance Music\n|publisher = W.
