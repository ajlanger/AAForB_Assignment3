Those words are etymologically connected with modern-day words ''\"vojnik\"'' ([[soldier]]) and ''\"voditi\"'' (to lead). Its original name (from 1848) was the \"[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodeship]]\" which then became \"[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat|Voivodeship of Serbia]]\".\n\nThe full official names of the province in all official languages of Vojvodina are:\n* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0458\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 / ''Autonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Vajdas\u00e1g Auton\u00f3m Tartom\u00e1ny''\n* [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Auton\u00f3mna pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Provincia Autonom\u0103 Voivodina''\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Autonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Pannonian Rusyn language/Ukrainian \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 (''Avtonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina'')\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Vojvodina}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Pre-Roman times and Roman rule===\nIn the Neolithic period, two important archaeological cultures flourished in this area: the [[Star\u010devo culture]] and the [[Vin\u010da culture]]. [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the [[Vu\u010dedol culture]], the [[Vatin culture]], and the [[Bosut culture]], among others.\n\nBefore the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic [[Scordisci|State of the Scordisci]] (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), and the [[Dacian Kingdom]] of [[Burebista]] (1st century BC).\n\nDuring Roman rule, [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was one of the four capital cities of the [[Roman Empire]], and six [[Roman Emperors]] were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including [[Pannonia Inferior]], [[Pannonia Secunda]], the [[Diocese of Pannonia]], and the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].\n\nRoman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While [[Banat]] was a part of the Roman province of [[Dacia]], [[Syrmia]] belonged to the Roman province of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. [[Ba\u010dka]] was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian [[Iazyges]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nAfter the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'', [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named [[Kuber]] circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with [[Tervel]] in the 8th century.\n[[File:Ara\u010da 5.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Ara\u010da]] church]]\n[[Slavs]] settled today's Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/997/Slovenski-grobovi-uz-reku-Galadsku|title=Slovenski grobovi uz reku Galadsku|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani.\n\nIn the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, [[Great Moravia]] and Ljudevit's Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], ruled over the region. Salan's residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad's descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the village of [[\u010celarevo]] archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the [[Kabars]] who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other [[Khazar]] tribes joined the [[Magyars]] and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895\u2013907.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n[[File:\u0411\u0410\u0427,\u0412\u041e\u0408\u0412\u041e\u0414\u0418\u041d\u0410,\u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0410..,,.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba\u010d Fortress]]]]\nFollowing territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population. But from the 14th century, the balance changed again in favour of the Slavs when Serbian refugees fleeing from territories conquered by the Ottoman army settled in the area.

In 1526 [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital.\n\nAt the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor's state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad's army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.\n\nA few decades later, the whole region was added to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, between [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from [[Central Europe]], and the supremacy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Tam\u0131\u015fvar]]) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.\n\n===Habsburg rule===\n\n====Hungarian Crown land (1699\u20131849)====\n[[File:Blagovestenski sabor 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Blagove\u0161tenski assembly in Sremski Karlovci, 1861]]\nDuring the [[Great Serb Migrations|Great Serb Migration]], Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690), most of whom settled what is now Hungary, the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. Therefore, all Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the [[Military Frontier]]) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south, as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Ba\u010dka were put under civil administration within the County of Ba\u010d. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of it was held by the Ottomans between 1787\u201388, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]]. In 1716, [[Vienna]] temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region. From 1782, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarians and [[ethnic Germans]] settled in larger numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|left|Proclaimed borders of Serbian Vojvodina at the May Assembly (1848) and autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848\u201349 revolutions]], Vojvodina was a site of war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of these two peoples. At the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (13\u201315 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (''Serbian Duchy''), a Serbian autonomous region within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The Serbian Voivodship consisted of Srem, Ba\u010dka, Banat, and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe head of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|metropolitanate of Sremski Karlovci]], [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected [[Patriarchate of Karlovci|patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] was chosen as first [[Voivode|voivod]] (duke).

Monthly and weekly publications in minority languages include ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'' (\"Croatian Word\") in Croatian, ''[[Hlas \u013dudu]]'' (\"The Voice of the People\") in Slovak, ''[[Libertatea (Vojvodina)|Libertatea]]'' (\"Freedom\") in Romanian, and ''[[Ruske slovo|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e]]'' (\"Rusyn Word\") in Rusyn. There is also ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'' (\"The Bunjevac newspaper\") in Bunjevac.\n\nPublic Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina was founded in 1974 as Radio Television of Novi Sad, as an equal member of the association of JRT \u2013 Yugoslav Radio Television. Radio Novi Sad's first broadcast was on November 29, 1949. During the NATO bombing in the spring of 1999, the RT Novi Sad building of 20 thousand square meters was completely destroyed along with its basic production and technical premises . The Venac terrestrial broadcasting site was heavily damaged.\n\nThe Radio-Television of Vojvodina produces and broadcasts regional programming on two channels, RTV1 (Serbian language) and RTV2 (minority languages), and three radio frequencies: Radio Novi Sad 1 (Serbian), Radio Novi Sad 2 (Hungarian), Radio Novi Sad 3 (other minority communities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio-Television of Vojvodina|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|Vojvodina is known as ''Serbia's breadbasket'']]\nThe economy of Vojvodina is largely based on developed food industry and fertile agricultural soil. Agriculture is a priority sector in Vojvodina. Traditionally, it has always been a significant part of the local economy and a generator of positive results, due to the abundance of fertile agricultural land which makes up 84% of its territory. The share of agribusiness in the total industrial production is 40%, that is 30% in the total exports of Vojvodina.\n\nThe metal industry of Vojvodina has a long tradition and consists of smaller metal processing companies for components manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with their own brand name products. Vojvodina Metal Cluster gathers 116 companies with 6,300 employees. Other branches of industry are also developed such as the chemical industry, electrical industry, oil industry and construction industry. In the past decade, ICT sector has been growing rapidly and has taken significant role in Vojvodina's economic development.\n\nHigh- tech sector is a fast-growing sector in Vojvodina. Software development represents the main source of revenue, particularly development of ERP solutions, Java applications and mobile applications. IT sector companies mainly deal with software outsourcing, based on demands of international clients or with development of their own software products for purposes of domestic and international market.\nVojvodina pays particular attention to interregional and cross-border economic cooperation, as well as to implementation of priorities defined within the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref name=\"vojvodina.gov.rs\"/>\n\nSome of the companies from Vojvodina:\n*[[Naftna Industrija Srbije]]\n*[[Srbijagas]]\n*[[HIP Petrohemija]]\n*[[Apatin Brewery]]\n*[[Novi Sad Fair|Novosadski sajam]]\n\nVojvodina promotes its investment potentials through the [[Vojvodina Investment Promotion]] (VIP) agency, which was founded by the Parliament of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===Transport===\nThere are many important roads which pass through Vojvodina. First of all, the motorway [[A1 (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] which goes from Central Europe and the Horgos border crossing to Hungary, via Novi Sad to Belgrade and further to the southeast toward Ni\u0161, where it branches: one way leads east to the border with Bulgaria; the other to the south, towards Greece. Motorway [[A3 (Serbia)|A3]] in Srem separates the west, towards the neighboring Croatia and further to Western Europe. There is also a network of regional and local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe three largest rivers in Vojvodina are navigable stream. Danube River with a length of 588 kilometers and its tributaries Tisa (168&nbsp;km), Sava (206&nbsp;km) and Bega (75&nbsp;km). Among them was dug extensive network of irrigation canals, drainage and transport, with a total length of {{cvt|939|km}}, of which {{cvt|673|km}} navigable.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Vojvodina}}\nTourist destinations in Vojvodina include well known [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monasteries on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] mountain, numerous hunting grounds, cultural-historical monuments, different folklores, interesting galleries and museums, plain landscapes with a lot of greenery, big rivers, canals and lakes, sandy terrain [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]] (\"the

It derives from the word ''\"vojvoda\"'' (See: [[voivode]]) which stems from the [[Proto-Slavic|Proto-Slavic language]] word ''\"voevoda\"''. Those words are etymologically connected with modern-day words ''\"vojnik\"'' ([[soldier]]) and ''\"voditi\"'' (to lead). Its original name (from 1848) was the \"[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodeship]]\" which then became \"[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat|Voivodeship of Serbia]]\".\n\nThe full official names of the province in all official languages of Vojvodina are:\n* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0458\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 / ''Autonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Vajdas\u00e1g Auton\u00f3m Tartom\u00e1ny''\n* [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Auton\u00f3mna pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Provincia Autonom\u0103 Voivodina''\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Autonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 (''Avtonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina'')\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Vojvodina}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Pre-Roman times and Roman rule===\nIn the Neolithic period, two important archaeological cultures flourished in this area: the [[Star\u010devo culture]] and the [[Vin\u010da culture]]. [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the [[Vu\u010dedol culture]], the [[Vatin culture]], and the [[Bosut culture]], among others.\n\nBefore the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic [[Scordisci|State of the Scordisci]] (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), and the [[Dacian Kingdom]] of [[Burebista]] (1st century BC).\n\nDuring Roman rule, [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was one of the four capital cities of the [[Roman Empire]], and six [[Roman Emperors]] were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including [[Pannonia Inferior]], [[Pannonia Secunda]], the [[Diocese of Pannonia]], and the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].\n\nRoman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While [[Banat]] was a part of the Roman province of [[Dacia]], [[Syrmia]] belonged to the Roman province of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. [[Ba\u010dka]] was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian [[Iazyges]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nAfter the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'', [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named [[Kuber]] circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with [[Tervel]] in the 8th century.\n[[File:Ara\u010da 5.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Ara\u010da]] church]]\n[[Slavs]] settled today's Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/997/Slovenski-grobovi-uz-reku-Galadsku|title=Slovenski grobovi uz reku Galadsku|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani.\n\nIn the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, [[Great Moravia]] and Ljudevit's Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], ruled over the region. Salan's residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad's descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the village of [[\u010celarevo]] archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the [[Kabars]] who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other [[Khazar]] tribes joined the [[Magyars]] and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895\u2013907.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n[[File:\u0411\u0410\u0427,\u0412\u041e\u0408\u0412\u041e\u0414\u0418\u041d\u0410,\u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0410..,,.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba\u010d Fortress]]]]\nFollowing territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population. But from the 14th century, the balance changed again in favour of the Slavs when Serbian refugees fleeing from territories conquered by the Ottoman army settled in the area.

In 1526 [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital.\n\nAt the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor's state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad's army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.\n\nA few decades later, the whole region was added to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, between [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from [[Central Europe]], and the supremacy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Tam\u0131\u015fvar]]) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.\n\n===Habsburg rule===\n\n====Hungarian Crown land (1699\u20131849)====\n[[File:Blagovestenski sabor 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Blagove\u0161tenski assembly in Sremski Karlovci, 1861]]\nDuring the [[Great Serb Migrations|Great Serb Migration]], Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690), most of whom settled what is now Hungary, the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. Therefore, all Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the [[Military Frontier]]) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south, as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Ba\u010dka were put under civil administration within the County of Ba\u010d. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of it was held by the Ottomans between 1787\u201388, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]]. In 1716, [[Vienna]] temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region. From 1782, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarians and [[ethnic Germans]] settled in larger numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|left|Proclaimed borders of Serbian Vojvodina at the May Assembly (1848) and autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848\u201349 revolutions]], Vojvodina was a site of war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of these two peoples. At the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (13\u201315 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (''Serbian Duchy''), a Serbian autonomous region within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The Serbian Voivodship consisted of Srem, Ba\u010dka, Banat, and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe head of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|metropolitanate of Sremski Karlovci]], [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected [[Patriarchate of Karlovci|patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] was chosen as first [[Voivode|voivod]] (duke).

Monthly and weekly publications in minority languages include ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'' (\"Croatian Word\") in Croatian, ''[[Hlas \u013dudu]]'' (\"The Voice of the People\") in Slovak, ''[[Libertatea (Vojvodina)|Libertatea]]'' (\"Freedom\") in Romanian, and ''[[Ruske slovo|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e]]'' (\"Rusyn Word\") in Rusyn. There is also ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'' (\"The Bunjevac newspaper\") in Bunjevac.\n\nPublic Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina was founded in 1974 as Radio Television of Novi Sad, as an equal member of the association of JRT \u2013 Yugoslav Radio Television. Radio Novi Sad's first broadcast was on November 29, 1949. During the NATO bombing in the spring of 1999, the RT Novi Sad building of 20 thousand square meters was completely destroyed along with its basic production and technical premises . The Venac terrestrial broadcasting site was heavily damaged.\n\nThe Radio-Television of Vojvodina produces and broadcasts regional programming on two channels, RTV1 (Serbian language) and RTV2 (minority languages), and three radio frequencies: Radio Novi Sad 1 (Serbian), Radio Novi Sad 2 (Hungarian), Radio Novi Sad 3 (other minority communities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio-Television of Vojvodina|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|Vojvodina is known as ''Serbia's breadbasket'']]\nThe economy of Vojvodina is largely based on developed food industry and fertile agricultural soil. Agriculture is a priority sector in Vojvodina. Traditionally, it has always been a significant part of the local economy and a generator of positive results, due to the abundance of fertile agricultural land which makes up 84% of its territory. The share of agribusiness in the total industrial production is 40%, that is 30% in the total exports of Vojvodina.\n\nThe metal industry of Vojvodina has a long tradition and consists of smaller metal processing companies for components manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with their own brand name products. Vojvodina Metal Cluster gathers 116 companies with 6,300 employees. Other branches of industry are also developed such as the chemical industry, electrical industry, oil industry and construction industry. In the past decade, ICT sector has been growing rapidly and has taken significant role in Vojvodina's economic development.\n\nHigh- tech sector is a fast-growing sector in Vojvodina. Software development represents the main source of revenue, particularly development of ERP solutions, Java applications and mobile applications. IT sector companies mainly deal with software outsourcing, based on demands of international clients or with development of their own software products for purposes of domestic and international market.\nVojvodina pays particular attention to interregional and cross-border economic cooperation, as well as to implementation of priorities defined within the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref name=\"vojvodina.gov.rs\"/>\n\nSome of the companies from Vojvodina:\n*[[Naftna Industrija Srbije]]\n*[[Srbijagas]]\n*[[HIP Petrohemija]]\n*[[Apatin Brewery]]\n*[[Novi Sad Fair|Novosadski sajam]]\n\nVojvodina promotes its investment potentials through the [[Vojvodina Investment Promotion]] (VIP) agency, which was founded by the Parliament of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===Transport===\nThere are many important roads which pass through Vojvodina. First of all, the motorway [[A1 (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] which goes from Central Europe and the Horgos border crossing to Hungary, via Novi Sad to Belgrade and further to the southeast toward Ni\u0161, where it branches: one way leads east to the border with Bulgaria; the other to the south, towards Greece. Motorway [[A3 (Serbia)|A3]] in Srem separates the west, towards the neighboring Croatia and further to Western Europe. There is also a network of regional and local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe three largest rivers in Vojvodina are navigable stream. Danube River with a length of 588 kilometers and its tributaries Tisa (168&nbsp;km), Sava (206&nbsp;km) and Bega (75&nbsp;km). Among them was dug extensive network of irrigation canals, drainage and transport, with a total length of {{cvt|939|km}}, of which {{cvt|673|km}} navigable.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Vojvodina}}\nTourist destinations in Vojvodina include well known [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monasteries on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] mountain, numerous hunting grounds, cultural-historical monuments, different folklores, interesting galleries and museums, plain landscapes with a lot of greenery, big rivers, canals and lakes, sandy terrain [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]] (\"the European Sahara\"), etc.\nIn the last few years, [[Exit (festival)|Exit]] has been very popular among the European summer music festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vojvodinaonline.com/?lang=en|title=Vojvodina online \u2013 Tourism Organisation of Vojvodina|work=vojvodinaonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vojvodina Autonomist Movement]]\n*[[Rinflaj\u0161]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Vojvodina}}\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.vojvodina.gov.rs/ Government of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.skupstinavojvodine.gov.rs/ Assembly of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.region.vojvodina.gov.rs/ Provincial Secretariat for Regional and International Cooperation]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.vojvodinaonline.com/ Tourism organization of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.vojvodinacafe.rs/ VojvodinaCafe \u2013 All about Vojvodina]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100712111010/http://www.explorevojvodina.com/ Useful information about Vojvodina, Parks of Nature, River Expedition, Wine Trails, Cities, Etno, Adventure and more]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=101201340841926980085.000484d76165f9e421e7c&z=14/ Interactive map of Novi Sad]\n*[[commons:Atlas of Vojvodina|Atlas of Vojvodina (Wikimedia Commons)]]\n*[http://www.anem.org.rs/mape/index-en.htm Statistical information about municipalities of Vojvodina]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310215502/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-244&srt=npan&col=aohdq&pt=c&va=&geo=-3987 List of largest cities of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|hu}} [http://vajdasag.rs ''The encyclopedia of Vojvodina'']\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Political divisions of Serbia}}\n{{Republics and autonomous provinces of the former Yugoslavia}}\n{{Serbia topics}}\n{{Autonomous provinces of Serbia}}\n{{Statistical regions of Serbia}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Vojvodina| ]]\n[[Category:Autonomous provinces of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Statistical regions of Serbia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1944]]\n[[Category:Historical regions in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Autonomous regions]]\n[[Category:Serbian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Romanian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Hungarian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Croatian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Slovak-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Regions of Europe with multiple official languages]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in Yugoslavia]]\n", "name_user": "2607:fea8:1160:18d4:1467:7729:6778:8283", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vojvodina"}
