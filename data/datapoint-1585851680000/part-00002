Mock''' (born January 16, 1956) is a Puerto Rican physician, gay activist, journalist, and writer who has published both works in the medical profession, works of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry.\n\n==Life==\nMock was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  He left Puerto Rico upon graduating from high school and attended [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, Maryland where he graduated [[Cum Laude]] in 1976 with a BA with a double major in Chemistry and Spanish Literature.  He then attended The [[University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine]] in San Juan where he obtained a [[Physician|MD]] in 1980.\n\nHe then did a flexible [[Internship (medicine)|internship]] at the [[United States Public Health Service|USPH]] Service Hospital in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and then did a four-year residency in [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Obstetrics and Gynecology]] at [[Stroger Hospital|Cook County Hospital]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], graduating in 1985.\n\nMock then joined a private place group at the Glen Ellyn Clinic where he practiced Obstetrics and Gynecology until 1996.  He developed an interest in [[infertility]] and [[twin]] pregnancies which led to the publication of a medical paper in the later topic.\n\nHe is a Life Fellow of the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] and a Life Member of the [[American Medical Association]].\n\nDue to complications from [[HIV]] therapy, he became disabled in May 1996.  He currently lives in Chicago, Illinois and [[Three Oaks, Michigan]] with his partner, Bill Rattan.\n\n==Activism==\nWhile at practice in the Glen Ellyn Clinic, Mock experienced first-hand the discrimination in the workforce against [[GLBT]] physicians when one of his colleagues was fired for being gay.  This, along with his HIV diagnosis, which forced him to retire, caused him to join the Board of [[Equality Illinois]] where he founded the Capitol Club.,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.chicagogayhistory.com/biography.html?id=771|title = Chicago Gay History|date = 2007-05-23|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> the fundraising arm of the organization, where he served from 2000 until 2009.
