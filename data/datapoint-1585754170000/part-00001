B Line and D Line were the breaker panels in which Powerline breakers were used. Eventually, the company branded Powerline and Powerlink panels and breakers.  Powerlink was a heavy duty 277-volt lighting breaker, used in large buildings with 277-volt lighting loads. These were also favored for their robust design, and functional reliability. This means less panel space and wire are needed.\n\nThe I-Line series of distribution panelboards is favored by many electricians for its ease and safety of adding new breakers. The panel uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a flat blade screwdriver contacting only de-energized parts of the backplane of the panel. The design of the breakers and panel require that extra attention be paid to phase rotation, as the right (even-numbered) side of the panel will have the phases in a C-B-A configuration whereas the left (odd-numbered) side of the panel will have a more standard A-B-C arrangement.\n\nSquare&nbsp;D also made disconnect switches, both fused, and unfused, as well as Heating Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HACR) rated switch boxes that held an HACR breaker for use as a disconnect.

A '''modern convenience''' is a [[Manual labour|labor]]-saving device, service or substance which make a task easier or more [[efficiency|efficient]] than a traditional method. Convenience is a relative concept, and depends on context. For example, [[automobile]]s were once considered a convenience, yet today are regarded as a normal part of life.\n\nBecause differences in [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s around the world, the term is a relative term based upon the conveniences previously available to a person or group.  For instance, an American definition of 'modern convenience' is likely different from that of an individual living in a [[developing country]]. Most of the time, the term 'modern convenience' is used to express personal lifestyle and home life.\n\n==Examples==\n'''Service conveniences''' are those that save shoppers time or effort, and includes variables such as [[Credit (finance)|credit]] availability and extended store hours.<ref name=\"Leonard\"/> Service convenience pertains to the facilitation of selling both goods and services, and combinations of the two.<ref name=\"Leonard\"/>\n\n'''Convenience goods''' are widely distributed products that \"require minimal time and physical and mental effort to purchase.\"<ref name=\"Leonard\"/>\n\n[[Convenience food|Ready meals]] and [[convenience cooking]] spare the consumer effort in preparation of a [[meal]] while providing high levels of energy and pronounced, if mostly artificial, [[flavour]].\n\n[[Filling station]]s sell items that have nothing to do with refuelling a motor vehicle, (eg milk, newspapers, cigarettes) but purchasing at that location can save the consumer time compared to making a separate journey to a [[supermarket]]. Conveniences such as [[wikt:direct deposit|direct deposit]] can save companies and [[consumer]]s money, though this may or may not be passed along to the consumer.\n\nSome conveniences can become nuisances when they break down or don't function correctly. It costs [[time]] and [[money]] to fix items of convenience when they break down, and may cause much greater costs if something else that depends on them cannot take place.\n\n==History==\n===Late 19th century===\n'''Household'''\nIn 1911, architect and author Louis. H. Gibson defined modern conveniences as \"those arrangements and appliances which make it possible for people to live [[comfort]]ably in a larger house, without seriously increasing the cares which they had in a smaller one\". The supposition is that at that time if a family lived in a smaller home, they would have less furniture, appliances and other goods to take care of, and as a result the family's lifestyle and [[housekeeping]] would be relatively easy.  If, on the other hand, a family moved into a larger home the increase area and furnishings would be much more difficult to manage without labor-saving devices.<ref name=Gibson1889>Gibson, Louis H.

Shabbat is observed from a few  minutes before sunset on Friday evening until a few minutes after the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night.<ref>[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Orach Chayim]] 293:2</ref> On Shabbat, Jews recall the [[Biblical Creation]] account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], describing God creating the Heavens and the Earth in six days and resting on the seventh. It also recalls the giving of the [[Torah]] at [[Mount Sinai]], when God commanded the Israelite nation to observe the seventh day and keep it holy. Shabbat is considered a festive day, when a Jew is freed from the regular labors of everyday life, can contemplate the spiritual aspects of life, and can spend time with family.\n\nOrthodox and some Conservative authorities rule that there are 39 [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|prohibited activities]] of work (referred to as \"''melakhot''\"), such as turning [[electricity|electric]] devices on or off, driving cars, and more, during the Shabbat, as listed in [[Mishnah]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Tractate Shabbat]].<ref>Neulander, Arthur.

The many labor-saving devices have kept pace with growing houses and furnishings and allow for greater [[leisure]]. There are also some negative effects, some of which are also as the result of advancements in [[chemical technology]] in the food that we eat or products that we use. In these cases there are also conflicting opinions about the extent to which some of the products are harmful. Here are a few examples of positive and negative effects of modern conveniences.\n\n===Positive effects===\n====Health care====\nSome of the major improvements over the past century has been in improved [[health care]]. For example, [[modern medicine]] has made leaps in preventing [[infectious diseases]] in part due to improved [[water treatment|water]] and [[sewage treatment]]. This is obvious in the marked rises in [[Life expectancy#Life expectancy variation over time|life expectancy]].<ref name=PureHealthMD>PureHealthMD editors.

Retrieved 9-18-2011.</ref>\n\n====Technological advancement in underdeveloped countries====\nSome of the most dramatic technological benefits are seen in underdeveloped countries. For instance, cabling for [[landline telephone]] service is expensive and requires a lot of time to complete, especially in the most remote areas. Introduction of [[cellphone]] service, on the other hand, is much cheaper and dramatically improves individual's ability to be economically productive, often in [[microbusiness]]es. It is estimated that 80% of the world's population is now located within range of cellular towers, 1.5 billion cellular phones are in use in developing countries and, in India alone, five million customers sign up for cellular service each week. The [[Four Asian Tigers]]\u2014i.e., [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[South Korea]]\u2014are a few of the countries that have leveraged technology to become a presence in the global community.<ref name=Kirkpatrick>Kirkpatrick, David.

As an example, the author compared having a calming cup of tea with a person to the more distant practice of placing a telephone call. Labor-saving devices meant that people now spent more time [[Sedentary lifestyle|sitting]], breathed machine-generated [[smoke]], and ate food, especially meat, fat and sugars, in greater abundance, changing peoples' diets. These activities were speculated to result in [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], and \"nervous strain\".<ref>George H. Simmons (ed.) (1905).
