These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the [[Supreme Court of California]], ''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'', in which the court imposed a [[rebuttable presumption]] of [[market share liability]] upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a [[Daubert]] hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial.

In 1971, a report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' showed a probable link between DES and [[clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina|vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma]] in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug ''in utero''. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use.<ref name=fr1971>{{cite journal |vauthors= ((United States Food and Drug Administration)) |year= 1971 |title= Certain estrogens for oral or parenteral use.

Abbott Laboratories]]'', in which the court imposed a [[rebuttable presumption]] of [[market share liability]] upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a [[Daubert]] hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial.
