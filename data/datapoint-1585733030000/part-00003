{"title_page": "Flag of Prussia", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of the Kingdom of Prussia (1803-1892).svg|300px|thumb|right|Flag of the Prussian kingdom for most of the 1800s]]\nThe state of [[Prussia]] had its origins in the separate lands of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and of the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. The Margraviate of Brandenburg developed from the medieval [[Northern March]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], passing to the [[House of Hohenzollern]] in 1415. The Duchy of Prussia originated in 1525 when [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], a member of a cadet branch of the Hohenzollerns, secularized the eastern [[state of the Teutonic Order|lands]] of the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]] as a [[Poland|Polish]] [[fief]]. [[Prince-elector]] [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]], inherited the Duchy of Prussia in 1618, thus uniting Brandenburg and Prussia under one ruler in a personal union; the Elector's state became known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] formed when Elector Frederick III assumed the title of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I, King in Prussia]], on 18 January 1701.\n\nHohenzollern monarchical rule of Prussia ceased in 1918 after the fall of the [[German Empire]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]]; the Kingdom becoming instead the [[Free State of Prussia]]. The [[Allied Control Council]] decreed the formal [[Abolition of Prussia |abolition of the state of Prussia]] in 1947 following [[World War II]].\n\n== Flags ==\nThe Prussian national and [[civil ensign|merchant flag]] was originally a simple black-white-black flag issued on May 22, 1818, but this was replaced on March 12, 1823, with a new flag. The revised one (3:5) was parted black, white, and black (1:4:1), showing in the white stripe the eagle with a blue [[globus cruciger|orb]] bound in gold and a [[sceptre|scepter]] ending in another eagle. On its breast were the intertwined initials ''FR'' for ''{{lang|la|Fridericus Rex}}''. The axis of the eagle is at two-fifths of the flag's total length.\n\nThe Prussian [[war flag]] (3:5), adopted November 28, 1816, was originally swallow-tailed for one-fifth of the total length; the tail was later abandoned. At two fifths it showed the Prussian eagle (two-thirds of the flag's height). In the canton, the [[Iron Cross]] was placed (one-third of the flag's height).<ref>H. G. Str\u00f6hl, ''Deutsche Wappenrolle'', Stuttgart 1987</ref>\n\nThe [[Iron Cross]] was established in 1813 during the [[Napoleonic Wars|war against Napoleon I]] as a decoration for courageous common soldiers. It was renewed in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and in [[World War I]]. It also appeared in the canton of the war flag of the [[German Empire]].\n\nThe royal standard of Prussia showed the Iron Cross charged with the shield and crown of the small state arms surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]]. On the blades of the cross is the motto ''{{lang|de|[[Gott mit uns]]}}''. Between the arms were Prussian eagles along the edges and a royal crown in carr\u00e9 with them, all on a purple or red background.\n\nAfter the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], the Prussian state was slow to adapt its heraldry to [[Weimar Republic|republican]] forms. Only July 11, 1921, new arms were decreed by the Prussian prime minister. The 'gothic' eagle made way for the more natural-looking flying one and lost all its garments.\n\nOn December 16, 1921, the Ministry of State decreed that the Prussian flag was to be only black and white.\n\nOn February 24 and April 23, 1922, the ministry issued a service flag similar to the national flag of the 19th century \u2013 black borders above and below, being one-sixth of the total height of the flag, with the new eagle.<ref>Siebmacher, ''Grosses Wappenbuch'', Band I, 1 Abteilung, 5.
