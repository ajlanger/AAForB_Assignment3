Retrieved Apr. 1, 2020.</ref> A [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] [[Romance novel#Science Fiction romance|love story]] about [[time travel]], it describes the misadventures of a man, Jack, after he finds his pregnant wife, Patience, murdered in their apartment. Many years later, when grief has destroyed his life, chance leads him to discover a time machine, which he plans to use to save Patience. \n\nThe book's tagline, in a surreal and [[tongue-in-cheek]] style typical of Clowes, is, \"a cosmic timewarp deathtrip to the primordial infinite of everlasting love\". The book uses bright, contrasting colours to evoke atmosphere, as well as surrealistic sci-fi imagery, when Jack free-falls between dimensions and has nightmarish visions of himself outside time and space. (Clowes' visual approach in his graphic novels tends to vary between full, even gaudy colour, and muted blues and greens that create a black-and-white effect, as in ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' and ''[[David Boring]]''.)\n\n==Background and creation==\n''Patience'' is Clowes' longest book, at around 180 pages, and is the second by him, after ''[[Wilson (comics)|Wilson]]'', to not have been serialized first, either in ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' \u2014 his own [[comic book]] series \u2014 or elsewhere.
