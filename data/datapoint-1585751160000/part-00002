In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote>\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with son Jonathan at the 2018 ANZAC Day March in Mandurah WA taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|His son Jonathan holding his hand, Andrew Hastie marches with veterans on [[Anzac Day]] in Mandurah. ]]\n\n Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions...

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote>\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with son Jonathan at the 2018 ANZAC Day March in Mandurah WA taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|His son Jonathan holding his hand, Andrew Hastie marches with veterans on [[Anzac Day]] in Mandurah. ]]\n\n Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions...

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].
