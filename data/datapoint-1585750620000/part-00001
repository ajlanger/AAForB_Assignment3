Some historians claim that this new land of Thule was either the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast or the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]] based on his descriptions and the trade routes of early British sailors. While no one knows exactly how far Pytheas sailed, he may have crossed the Arctic Circle. Nevertheless, his tales were regarded as fantasy by later Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authorities, such as the geographer [[Strabo]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n[[Image:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking sailors reached the White Sea and Greenland and North America]]\nThe first [[Viking]] to sight Iceland was [[Gardar Svavarsson]], who lost his route due to harsh conditions when sailing from Norway to the [[Faroe Islands]]. This quickly led to a wave of colonization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Not all the settlers were successful however in the attempts to reach the island. In the 10th century, [[Gunnbj\u00f6rn Ulfsson]] got lost in a storm and ended up within sight of the [[Greenland]] coast. His report spurred [[Erik the Red]], an outlawed chieftain, to establish a settlement there in 985. While they flourished initially, these settlements eventually foundered due to changing climatic conditions (see [[Little Ice Age]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are believed to have survived until around 1450.\n\nGreenland's early settlers sailed westward, in search of better [[pasture|pasturage]] and hunting grounds. Modern scholars debate the precise location of the new lands of [[Vinland]], [[Markland]], and [[Helluland]] that they discovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe [[Scandinavia]]n peoples also pushed farther north into their own peninsula by land and by sea. As early as 880, the Viking [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]] rounded the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] and sailed to the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the [[White Sea]]. The [[Pechenga Monastery]] on the north of Kola Peninsula was founded by Russian monks in 1533; from their base at [[Kola (town)|Kola]], the [[Pomors]] explored the [[Barents Region]], [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Novaya Zemlya]]\u2014all of which are in the Arctic Circle. They also explored north by boat, discovering the [[Northern Sea Route]], as well as penetrating to the trans-[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] areas of northern [[Siberia]]. They then founded the settlement of [[Mangazeya]] east of the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in the early 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1648 the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the now famous [[Bering Strait]] between America and Asia.\n\nRussian [[settler]]s and traders on the coasts of the White Sea, the Pomors, had been exploring parts of the northeast passage as early as the 11th century. By the 17th century they established a continuous [[Trade route|sea route]] from [[Arkhangelsk]] as far east as the mouth of [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]]. This route, known as ''Mangazeya seaway'', after its eastern terminus, the trade depot of Mangazeya, was an early precursor to the Northern Sea Route.\n\n==Age of Discovery==\n{{See also|Age of Discovery}}\n[[File:1606 Mercator Hondius Map of the Arctic (First Map of the North Pole) - Geographicus - NorthPole-mercator-1606.jpg|thumb|Mercator's map of the North Pole (1606)]]\nExploration to the north of the Arctic Circle in the [[Renaissance]] was both driven by the rediscovery of the [[Classics]] and the national quests for commercial expansion, and hampered by limits in [[Shipbuilding#Early Modern|maritime technology]], lack of [[Shelf stable food|stable food]] supplies, and insufficient insulation for the crew against extreme cold.\n\n===Renaissance advancements in cartography===\n\n[[Image:John Cabot patent.jpg|thumb|Patent from King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], authorizing [[John Cabot]] and his sons to explore new lands in the west]]\nA seminal event in Arctic exploration occurred in 1409, when [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' was translated into [[Latin]], thereby introducing the concepts of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] into [[Western Europe]].<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Ptolemy_geo.html Online Exhibit Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture]</ref> Navigators were better able to chart their positions, and the [[Europe]]an race to [[China]], sparked by interest in the writings of [[Marco Polo]], commenced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The ''[[Inventio Fortunata]]'', a [[Lost work|lost book]], describes in a summary written by Jacobus Cnoyen but only found in a letter from [[Gerardus Mercator]], voyages as far as the North Pole.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = E.G.R. | author-link = Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor | title = A Letter Dated 1577 from Mercator to John Dee | journal = Imago Mundi | volume = 13 | pages = 56\u201368 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1080/03085695608592127}}</ref> One widely disputed claim is that two brothers from [[Venice]], [[Zeno brothers|Niccolo and Antonio Zeno]], allegedly made a [[Zeno map|map]] of their journeys to that region, which were published by their descendants in 1558.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=592 \"Zeno, Nicolo and Antonio\" at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']</ref>\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[Image:northwest passage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Northwest Passage]]]]\nThe [[Northwest Passage]] connects the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s via the Arctic Ocean. Since the discovery of the [[American continent]] was the product of the search for a route to Asia, exploration around the northern edge of [[North America]] continued for the Northwest Passage. [[John Cabot]]'s initial failure in 1497 to find a Northwest Passage across the Atlantic led the British to seek an alternative route to the east.\n\nInterest re-kindled in 1564 after [[Jacques Cartier]]'s discovery of the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. [[Martin Frobisher]] had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. From 1576 to 1578, he took three trips to what is now the [[Canadian Arctic]] in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]] is named after him. In July 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], who had written a treatise on the discovery of the passage and was a backer of Frobisher's, claimed the [[Newfoundland Colony|territory of Newfoundland]] for the English crown.\n\nIn 1585, under the employ of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]]. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy Arctic waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is \"a matter nothing doubtfull {{sic}},\"{{uncited quote|date=February 2007}} and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as [[Hudson Bay]].\n\nThough England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1609, while in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] sailed up what is now called the [[Hudson River]] in search of the Passage; he reached present-day [[Albany, New York]], before giving up. He later explored further north into the Arctic and [[Hudson Bay]] for the Passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/hell/anthology/travel/Travel1625Pricket.htm |title=Excerpt from A Larger Discourse of the Same Voyage |author= Abacuk Pricket |date=1625 |publisher=Chass.utoronto.ca |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=343 |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |publisher=Biographi.ca |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== The Northeast Passage ===\n{{Main|Northeast Passage}}\n{{See also|Northern Sea Route}}\n[[Image:Arctic 1644.jpg|thumb|200px|Jan Jansson's map of the \"Poli Arctici\" from 1644.]]\nThe Northeast Passage is a broad term for any route lying above the Eurasian continent and stretching between the waters north of the Norwegian Sea to the Bering Strait.  The \"Northern Sea Route\" is defined as a specific portion of such routes.  The ''Northern Sea Route'' (capitalized) as currently officially defined by Russian Federation law includes [[shipping]] lanes falling within Russia's EEZ and extending from the Kara Sea to the Bering Strait along the [[Russia]]n northern coast.\n\nThe idea to explore this region was initially economic, and was first put forward by Russian diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov]] in 1525. The entire route lies in Arctic waters and parts are only totally free of ice for about two months per year, making it a very perilous journey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, John Cabot's son [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]] helped organize just such an expedition, led by Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and [[Richard Chancellor]]. Willoughby's crew was shipwrecked off the Kola Peninsula, where they eventually died of [[scurvy]]. Chancellor and his crew made it to the mouth of the [[Northern Dvina River|Dvina River]] and the town of Arkhangelsk, where they were met by a delegation from the [[Tsar]], [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]]. Brought back to [[Moscow]], he launched the [[Muscovy Company]], promoting trade between England and Russia. This diplomatic course allowed British Ambassadors such as [[Francis Cherry (diplomat)|Sir Francis Cherry]] the opportunity to consolidate geographic information developed by Russian merchants into maps for British exploration of the region. Some years later, [[Steven Borough]], the master of Chancellor's ship, made it as far as the [[Kara Sea]], when he was forced to turn back because of icy conditions.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Wright | first = Helen Saunders | title = The great white North: the story of polar exploration from the earliest times to the discovery of the Pole | publisher = The Macmillan co. | year = 1910 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/greatwhitenorth00wriggoog/page/n41 7] | url = https://archive.org/details/greatwhitenorth00wriggoog| quote = helen wright great white north. }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Barentsz arctic map.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Spitsbergen]] and [[Svalbard]] during the [[:Category:Dutch exploration in the Age of Discovery|Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery]] (ca. 1590s\u20131720s).

Although these expeditions failed, new coasts and islands were discovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Most notable is the 1596 expedition led by Dutch navigator [[Willem Barentsz]] who discovered Spitsbergen and [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]].\n\nFearing English and Dutch penetration into Siberia, Russia closed the Mangazeya seaway in 1619. Pomor activity in Northern Asia declined and the bulk of exploration in the 17th century was carried out by Siberian Cossacks, sailing from one river mouth to another in their Arctic-worthy ''[[Koch (boat)|kochs]]''. In 1648 the most famous of these expeditions, led by Fedot Alekseev and [[Semyon Dezhnev]], sailed east from the mouth of [[Kolyma]] to the Pacific and doubled the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], thus proving that there was no land connection between Asia and North America.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Fisher | first = Raymond H | title = The Voyage of Semen Dezhnev in 1648 | publisher = The Hakluyt Society | year = 1981}}</ref> Eighty years after Dezhnev, in 1728, another Russian explorer, Danish-born [[Vitus Bering]] on ''Sviatoy Gavriil'' made a similar voyage in reverse, starting in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and going north to the passage that now bears his name (Bering Strait).

Nevertheless, his tales were regarded as fantasy by later Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authorities, such as the geographer [[Strabo]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n[[Image:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking sailors reached the White Sea and Greenland and North America]]\nThe first [[Viking]] to sight Iceland was [[Gardar Svavarsson]], who lost his route due to harsh conditions when sailing from Norway to the [[Faroe Islands]]. This quickly led to a wave of colonization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Not all the settlers were successful however in the attempts to reach the island. In the 10th century, [[Gunnbj\u00f6rn Ulfsson]] got lost in a storm and ended up within sight of the [[Greenland]] coast. His report spurred [[Erik the Red]], an outlawed chieftain, to establish a settlement there in 985. While they flourished initially, these settlements eventually foundered due to changing climatic conditions (see [[Little Ice Age]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are believed to have survived until around 1450.\n\nGreenland's early settlers sailed westward, in search of better [[pasture|pasturage]] and hunting grounds. Modern scholars debate the precise location of the new lands of [[Vinland]], [[Markland]], and [[Helluland]] that they discovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe [[Scandinavia]]n peoples also pushed farther north into their own peninsula by land and by sea. As early as 880, the Viking [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]] rounded the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] and sailed to the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the [[White Sea]]. The [[Pechenga Monastery]] on the north of Kola Peninsula was founded by Russian monks in 1533; from their base at [[Kola (town)|Kola]], the [[Pomors]] explored the [[Barents Region]], [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Novaya Zemlya]]\u2014all of which are in the Arctic Circle. They also explored north by boat, discovering the [[Northern Sea Route]], as well as penetrating to the trans-[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] areas of northern [[Siberia]]. They then founded the settlement of [[Mangazeya]] east of the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in the early 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1648 the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the now famous [[Bering Strait]] between America and Asia.\n\nRussian [[settler]]s and traders on the coasts of the White Sea, the Pomors, had been exploring parts of the northeast passage as early as the 11th century. By the 17th century they established a continuous [[Trade route|sea route]] from [[Arkhangelsk]] as far east as the mouth of [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]]. This route, known as ''Mangazeya seaway'', after its eastern terminus, the trade depot of Mangazeya, was an early precursor to the Northern Sea Route.\n\n==Age of Discovery==\n{{See also|Age of Discovery}}\n[[File:1606 Mercator Hondius Map of the Arctic (First Map of the North Pole) - Geographicus - NorthPole-mercator-1606.jpg|thumb|Mercator's map of the North Pole (1606)]]\nExploration to the north of the Arctic Circle in the [[Renaissance]] was both driven by the rediscovery of the [[Classics]] and the national quests for commercial expansion, and hampered by limits in [[Shipbuilding#Early Modern|maritime technology]], lack of [[Shelf stable food|stable food]] supplies, and insufficient insulation for the crew against extreme cold.\n\n===Renaissance advancements in cartography===\n\n[[Image:John Cabot patent.jpg|thumb|Patent from King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], authorizing [[John Cabot]] and his sons to explore new lands in the west]]\nA seminal event in Arctic exploration occurred in 1409, when [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' was translated into [[Latin]], thereby introducing the concepts of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] into [[Western Europe]].<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Ptolemy_geo.html Online Exhibit Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture]</ref> Navigators were better able to chart their positions, and the [[Europe]]an race to [[China]], sparked by interest in the writings of [[Marco Polo]], commenced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The ''[[Inventio Fortunata]]'', a [[Lost work|lost book]], describes in a summary written by Jacobus Cnoyen but only found in a letter from [[Gerardus Mercator]], voyages as far as the North Pole.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = E.G.R. | author-link = Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor | title = A Letter Dated 1577 from Mercator to John Dee | journal = Imago Mundi | volume = 13 | pages = 56\u201368 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1080/03085695608592127}}</ref> One widely disputed claim is that two brothers from [[Venice]], [[Zeno brothers|Niccolo and Antonio Zeno]], allegedly made a [[Zeno map|map]] of their journeys to that region, which were published by their descendants in 1558.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=592 \"Zeno, Nicolo and Antonio\" at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']</ref>\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[Image:northwest passage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Northwest Passage]]]]\nThe [[Northwest Passage]] connects the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s via the Arctic Ocean. Since the discovery of the [[American continent]] was the product of the search for a route to Asia, exploration around the northern edge of [[North America]] continued for the Northwest Passage. [[John Cabot]]'s initial failure in 1497 to find a Northwest Passage across the Atlantic led the British to seek an alternative route to the east.\n\nInterest re-kindled in 1564 after [[Jacques Cartier]]'s discovery of the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. [[Martin Frobisher]] had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. From 1576 to 1578, he took three trips to what is now the [[Canadian Arctic]] in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]] is named after him. In July 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], who had written a treatise on the discovery of the passage and was a backer of Frobisher's, claimed the [[Newfoundland Colony|territory of Newfoundland]] for the English crown.\n\nIn 1585, under the employ of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]]. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy Arctic waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is \"a matter nothing doubtfull {{sic}},\"{{uncited quote|date=February 2007}} and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as [[Hudson Bay]].\n\nThough England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1609, while in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] sailed up what is now called the [[Hudson River]] in search of the Passage; he reached present-day [[Albany, New York]], before giving up. He later explored further north into the Arctic and [[Hudson Bay]] for the Passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/hell/anthology/travel/Travel1625Pricket.htm |title=Excerpt from A Larger Discourse of the Same Voyage |author= Abacuk Pricket |date=1625 |publisher=Chass.utoronto.ca |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=343 |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |publisher=Biographi.ca |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== The Northeast Passage ===\n{{Main|Northeast Passage}}\n{{See also|Northern Sea Route}}\n[[Image:Arctic 1644.jpg|thumb|200px|Jan Jansson's map of the \"Poli Arctici\" from 1644.]]\nThe Northeast Passage is a broad term for any route lying above the Eurasian continent and stretching between the waters north of the Norwegian Sea to the Bering Strait.  The \"Northern Sea Route\" is defined as a specific portion of such routes.  The ''Northern Sea Route'' (capitalized) as currently officially defined by Russian Federation law includes [[shipping]] lanes falling within Russia's EEZ and extending from the Kara Sea to the Bering Strait along the [[Russia]]n northern coast.\n\nThe idea to explore this region was initially economic, and was first put forward by Russian diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov]] in 1525. The entire route lies in Arctic waters and parts are only totally free of ice for about two months per year, making it a very perilous journey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, John Cabot's son [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]] helped organize just such an expedition, led by Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and [[Richard Chancellor]]. Willoughby's crew was shipwrecked off the Kola Peninsula, where they eventually died of [[scurvy]]. Chancellor and his crew made it to the mouth of the [[Northern Dvina River|Dvina River]] and the town of Arkhangelsk, where they were met by a delegation from the [[Tsar]], [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]]. Brought back to [[Moscow]], he launched the [[Muscovy Company]], promoting trade between England and Russia. This diplomatic course allowed British Ambassadors such as [[Francis Cherry (diplomat)|Sir Francis Cherry]] the opportunity to consolidate geographic information developed by Russian merchants into maps for British exploration of the region. Some years later, [[Steven Borough]], the master of Chancellor's ship, made it as far as the [[Kara Sea]], when he was forced to turn back because of icy conditions.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Wright | first = Helen Saunders | title = The great white North: the story of polar exploration from the earliest times to the discovery of the Pole | publisher = The Macmillan co. | year = 1910 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/greatwhitenorth00wriggoog/page/n41 7] | url = https://archive.org/details/greatwhitenorth00wriggoog| quote = helen wright great white north. }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Barentsz arctic map.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Spitsbergen]] and [[Svalbard]] during the [[:Category:Dutch exploration in the Age of Discovery|Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery]] (ca. 1590s\u20131720s).

Pomor activity in Northern Asia declined and the bulk of exploration in the 17th century was carried out by Siberian Cossacks, sailing from one river mouth to another in their Arctic-worthy ''[[Koch (boat)|kochs]]''. In 1648 the most famous of these expeditions, led by Fedot Alekseev and [[Semyon Dezhnev]], sailed east from the mouth of [[Kolyma]] to the Pacific and doubled the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], thus proving that there was no land connection between Asia and North America.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Fisher | first = Raymond H | title = The Voyage of Semen Dezhnev in 1648 | publisher = The Hakluyt Society | year = 1981}}</ref> Eighty years after Dezhnev, in 1728, another Russian explorer, Danish-born [[Vitus Bering]] on ''Sviatoy Gavriil'' made a similar voyage in reverse, starting in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and going north to the passage that now bears his name (Bering Strait).
