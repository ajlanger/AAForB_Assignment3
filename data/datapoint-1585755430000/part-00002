Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired [[stimulant]] effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist [[Kenneth Koe]], after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and [[serotonin-noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|triple reuptake]] inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive [[cis-trans isomerism|cis-analogs]] was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] of this compound, which were tested ''[[in vivo]]'' by animal [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral scientist]] Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type\u2014in that sense their inquiry was not \"very goal driven\", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was [[serendipity#Pharmacology|serendipitous]].

Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired [[stimulant]] effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist [[Kenneth Koe]], after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and [[serotonin-noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|triple reuptake]] inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive [[cis-trans isomerism|cis-analogs]] was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] of this compound, which were tested ''[[in vivo]]'' by animal [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral scientist]] Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type\u2014in that sense their inquiry was not \"very goal driven\", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was [[serendipity#Pharmacology|serendipitous]]. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even \"did not have a formal project team\". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.<ref name=Welch>The most complete account of sertraline discovery, targeted at chemists, see: {{Cite book |author=Welch WM |title=Discovery and Development of Sertraline |volume=3 |pages=113\u2013148 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/S1067-5698(06)80005-2 |series=Advances in Medicinal Chemistry |isbn=978-1-55938-798-9}}</ref><ref>See also: {{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cen-v084n010.p045 |author=Mullin R |title=ACS Award for Team Innovation |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=45\u201352 |year=2006}}</ref><ref>A short blurb on the history of sertraline, see: {{cite journal | vauthors = Couzin J | title = The brains behind blockbusters | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5735 | pages = 728 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16051786 | doi = 10.1126/science.309.5735.728 }}</ref>\n\nSertraline was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the [[United Kingdom]] the previous year.<ref name=He168>{{cite book |title=The Antidepressant Era |last=Healy |first=David | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=David Healy (psychiatrist)|year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03958-2 |page=168}}</ref> The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of MDD.\n\nSertraline entered the Australian market in 1994 and became the most often prescribed antidepressant in 1996 (2004 data).<ref name=\"pmid15462638\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Mant A, Rendle VA, Hall WD, Mitchell PB, Montgomery WS, McManus PR, Hickie IB |title= Making new choices about antidepressants in Australia: the long view 1975-2002 |journal= The Medical Journal of Australia |volume= 181 |issue= 7 Suppl |pages= S21\u20134 |date= October 2004 |pmid= 15462638 }}</ref> It was measured as among the top ten drugs ranked by cost to the Australian government in 1998 and 2000\u201301, having cost $45 million and $87 million in subsidies respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1999 |title=Top 10 drugs&nbsp;\u2013 1998 |journal=Australian Prescriber |volume=22 |page=119 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/22/5/artid/328/ |access-date=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514073844/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/22/5/artid/328/ |archive-date=2008-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=2001 |title=Top 10 drugs&nbsp;\u2013 2000\u201301 |journal=Australian Prescriber |volume=24 |page=136 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/24/6/artid/549/ |access-date=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514073720/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/24/6/artid/549/ |archive-date=2008-05-14}}</ref> Sertraline is less popular in the UK (2003 data) and Canada (2006 data)\u2014in both countries it was fifth (among drugs marketed for the treatment of MDD, or antidepressants), based on the number of prescriptions.<ref name=\"url\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/websiteresources/con019473.pdf |title=Prescribing trends for SSRIs and related antidepressants|year=2004 |publisher=UK MHRA |access-date=30 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/COMMERCE.WEB/publication_details.aspx?pubID=4542 |title=Canada's Drug Price Paradox 2007 |vauthors=Skinner BJ, Rovere M |date=31 July 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=The Fraser Institute |pages=21\u201329 |access-date=11 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD.
