The pandemic reached the Philippines on May 21, 2009 when a 10-year-old female traveling with her family first contracted the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|A(H1N1)]] virus while vacationing in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[US]]. In the following days, several local cases were reported to be caused by contact with two infected [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] women who attended a wedding ceremony in Zambales.\n\nThe 10-year-old arrived at the country on May 18 and was hospitalized the day after at the [[Research Institute for Tropical Medicine]] in [[Muntinlupa]]. On May 21, Department of Health (DOH) secretary [[Francisco Duque]] confirmed the case being the first Philippine swine flu case. The first confirmed case in the Philippines was publicly announced on May 22, 2009.\n\nSince the outbreak of A(H1N1) in the Americas, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] urged the Department of Health, the [[Bureau of Immigration (Philippines)|Bureau of Immigration]], the [[Bureau of Quarantine (Philippines)|Bureau of Quarantine]] and other concerned agencies to control monitor airport and seaport arrivals for possible flu infection.
