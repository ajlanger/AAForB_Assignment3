As Fidel's brother and trusted right-hand man, and given his proven leadership abilities during and after the Moncada attack, he was given progressively bigger commands. On 27 February 1958 Ra\u00fal was made ''comandante'' and assigned the mission to cross the old province of [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] leading a column of guerrillas to open, to the northeast of that territory, the \"[[Frank Pa\u00eds]] Eastern Front\".\n\nAs a result of Ra\u00fal's \"Eastern Front\" operations, he was not involved in the pivotal [[Operation Verano]] (which came close to destroying the main body of fighters but ended up a spectacular victory for Fidel), but Ra\u00fal's forces remained active and grew over time.\n\nOn 26 June 1958, Ra\u00fal Castro's rebels kidnapped ten Americans and two Canadians from the property of Moa Bay Mining Company (an American company) on the north coast of Oriente Province. The next day rebels took hostage 24 US servicemen on leave from the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay. This incident brought total kidnapped hostages to 36 (34 US and 2 Canadian citizens).\n\nUS Ambassador Smith and his staff determined the kidnappings had the following objectives: Obtain worldwide publicity, regain M-26-7 prestige lost by general strike call failure, force Batista's Air Force to stop bombing rebel holds, and gain public recognition from the US. Two tactical objectives the kidnapping achieved for Castro forces can be discerned from contemporaneous reporting in Time: Batista declaring a ceasefire for negotiations, forcing a reduction in Operation Verano air raids; the rebels used the lulls to regroup and fly in arms.\n\nThe hostage-taking caused significant US backlash, including unfavorable public reaction, and US consideration to re-establishing military support to Batista and deploying US forces to free the hostages. Ultimately, the hostages were released in very small groups, extracting the maximum press attention.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868579,00.html|title=CUBA: Caught in a War|date=July 14, 1958}}</ref> After their release, the hostages said they were treated well with some even claiming to support the rebel cause.<ref>Pierre Kalfon, Che, 1997</ref>\n\nRegarding the captured Batista government soldiers, Ra\u00fal Castro notes in his war diaries: \"All three were brought food and told that they would be released and only their weapons would be kept. They had money and watches we needed, but according to our principles, we didn't touch them.

In December, while [[Che Guevara]] and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] were operating in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], Fidel and Ra\u00fal's army laid siege to Maffo, capturing it on 30 December. Their victorious army then headed to [[Santiago de Cuba]], capital of Oriente province.\n\nIn response to the victory by Che Guevara at the [[Battle of Santa Clara]], the U.S.-backed President [[Fulgencio Batista]] fled Cuba in the early morning of 1 January 1959.<ref>Audio: [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98937598 Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'] by Jason Beaubien, ''NPR All Things Considered'', 1 January 2009</ref> The two Castro brothers with their army arrived on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba and said their forces would storm the city at 6&nbsp;P.M. on 1 January if it did not first surrender.

The war was over and Fidel was able to take power in Havana when he arrived on 8 January 1959.\n\nRa\u00fal's abilities as a military leader during the revolution are hard to see clearly.

As Fidel's brother and trusted right-hand man, and given his proven leadership abilities during and after the Moncada attack, he was given progressively bigger commands. On 27 February 1958 Ra\u00fal was made ''comandante'' and assigned the mission to cross the old province of [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] leading a column of guerrillas to open, to the northeast of that territory, the \"[[Frank Pa\u00eds]] Eastern Front\".\n\nAs a result of Ra\u00fal's \"Eastern Front\" operations, he was not involved in the pivotal [[Operation Verano]] (which came close to destroying the main body of fighters but ended up a spectacular victory for Fidel), but Ra\u00fal's forces remained active and grew over time.\n\nOn 26 June 1958, Ra\u00fal Castro's rebels kidnapped ten Americans and two Canadians from the property of Moa Bay Mining Company (an American company) on the north coast of Oriente Province. The next day rebels took hostage 24 US servicemen on leave from the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay. This incident brought total kidnapped hostages to 36 (34 US and 2 Canadian citizens).\n\nUS Ambassador Smith and his staff determined the kidnappings had the following objectives: Obtain worldwide publicity, regain M-26-7 prestige lost by general strike call failure, force Batista's Air Force to stop bombing rebel holds, and gain public recognition from the US. Two tactical objectives the kidnapping achieved for Castro forces can be discerned from contemporaneous reporting in Time: Batista declaring a ceasefire for negotiations, forcing a reduction in Operation Verano air raids; the rebels used the lulls to regroup and fly in arms.\n\nThe hostage-taking caused significant US backlash, including unfavorable public reaction, and US consideration to re-establishing military support to Batista and deploying US forces to free the hostages. Ultimately, the hostages were released in very small groups, extracting the maximum press attention.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868579,00.html|title=CUBA: Caught in a War|date=July 14, 1958}}</ref> After their release, the hostages said they were treated well with some even claiming to support the rebel cause.<ref>Pierre Kalfon, Che, 1997</ref>\n\nRegarding the captured Batista government soldiers, Ra\u00fal Castro notes in his war diaries: \"All three were brought food and told that they would be released and only their weapons would be kept. They had money and watches we needed, but according to our principles, we didn't touch them.

In December, while [[Che Guevara]] and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] were operating in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], Fidel and Ra\u00fal's army laid siege to Maffo, capturing it on 30 December. Their victorious army then headed to [[Santiago de Cuba]], capital of Oriente province.\n\nIn response to the victory by Che Guevara at the [[Battle of Santa Clara]], the U.S.-backed President [[Fulgencio Batista]] fled Cuba in the early morning of 1 January 1959.<ref>Audio: [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98937598 Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'] by Jason Beaubien, ''NPR All Things Considered'', 1 January 2009</ref> The two Castro brothers with their army arrived on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba and said their forces would storm the city at 6&nbsp;P.M. on 1 January if it did not first surrender. The commander (Colonel Rego Rubido) surrendered Santiago de Cuba without a fight. The war was over and Fidel was able to take power in Havana when he arrived on 8 January 1959.\n\nRa\u00fal's abilities as a military leader during the revolution are hard to see clearly.
