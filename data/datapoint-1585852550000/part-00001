At a young age, she married Agricole Breaux; and together, they had five children. In 1817, the couple replaced the Bayou Teche suspension footbridge built by Agricole's father with a vehicular bridge that allowed wagon passage and made way for the area's increasing commerce. At the age of 32, Scholastique became a widow.\n\nA determined Acadian woman, Scholastique drew up ''Plan de la Ville Du Pont des Breaux (''the plan for the Village of Breaux Bridge), which included a detailed map of the area and a diagram of streets. She developed the area by selling land lots to other [[Acadian]] settlers. In 1847, a church parish was created; and 12 years later, the area was officially incorporated. After founding the town, Scholastique remarried and birthed an additional two children.\n\n=== Breaux's Bridge ===\nAgricole's father was the Acadian pioneer [[Firmin Breaux]].  Breaux first arrived in the area during early 1765. By 1774, his branding iron was registered, and by 1786 he was one of the largest property owners in the [[Bayou Teche]] country. In 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Teche to help ease the passage across for his family and neighbors. This first bridge was a suspension footbridge, likely made of rope and small planks. It was stabilized by being tied to small pilings located at each end of the bridge  as well as to a pair of huge [[southern live oak|live oak]] trees on both sides of the bayou. When traveling directions were given, residents would often instruct people to ''\"go to Breaux's bridge . . .\"''  This was later adopted as the city's name.<ref name=\"History_of_Breaux_Bridge\">[http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107 gov.breauxbridgelive.com \"History of Breaux Bridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204512/http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107|date=January 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBreaux Bridge is located at {{Coord|30|16|33|N|91|54|4|W|type:city}} (30.275939, -91.901230).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Breaux Bridge, Louisiana (4).jpg|thumb|Shops in Breaux Bridge.]]\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 443\n|1890= 654\n|1900= 654\n|1910= 1339\n|1920= 1171\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1668\n|1950= 2492\n|1960= 3303\n|1970= 4942\n|1980= 5922\n|1990= 6515\n|2000= 7281\n|2010= 8139\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8227\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 8,139 people living in the city. 50.0% were [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 47.3% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.4% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.4% from some other race and 1.3% [[Multiracial American|from two or more races]]. 1.3% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 7,281 people, 2,512 households, and 1,821 families living in the city.

At a young age, she married Agricole Breaux; and together, they had five children. In 1817, the couple replaced the Bayou Teche suspension footbridge built by Agricole's father with a vehicular bridge that allowed wagon passage and made way for the area's increasing commerce. At the age of 32, Scholastique became a widow.\n\nA determined Acadian woman, Scholastique drew up ''Plan de la Ville Du Pont des Breaux (''the plan for the Village of Breaux Bridge), which included a detailed map of the area and a diagram of streets. She developed the area by selling land lots to other [[Acadian]] settlers. In 1847, a church parish was created; and 12 years later, the area was officially incorporated. After founding the town, Scholastique remarried and birthed an additional two children.\n\n=== Breaux's Bridge ===\nAgricole's father was the Acadian pioneer [[Firmin Breaux]].  Breaux first arrived in the area during early 1765. By 1774, his branding iron was registered, and by 1786 he was one of the largest property owners in the [[Bayou Teche]] country. In 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Teche to help ease the passage across for his family and neighbors. This first bridge was a suspension footbridge, likely made of rope and small planks. It was stabilized by being tied to small pilings located at each end of the bridge  as well as to a pair of huge [[southern live oak|live oak]] trees on both sides of the bayou. When traveling directions were given, residents would often instruct people to ''\"go to Breaux's bridge . . .\"''  This was later adopted as the city's name.<ref name=\"History_of_Breaux_Bridge\">[http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107 gov.breauxbridgelive.com \"History of Breaux Bridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204512/http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107|date=January 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBreaux Bridge is located at {{Coord|30|16|33|N|91|54|4|W|type:city}} (30.275939, -91.901230).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Breaux Bridge, Louisiana (4).jpg|thumb|Shops in Breaux Bridge.]]\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 443\n|1890= 654\n|1900= 654\n|1910= 1339\n|1920= 1171\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1668\n|1950= 2492\n|1960= 3303\n|1970= 4942\n|1980= 5922\n|1990= 6515\n|2000= 7281\n|2010= 8139\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8227\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 8,139 people living in the city. 50.0% were [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 47.3% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.4% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.4% from some other race and 1.3% [[Multiracial American|from two or more races]]. 1.3% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 7,281 people, 2,512 households, and 1,821 families living in the city.
