The first futtocks overlap the floor-timbers about two feet, placed alongside of them, forming almost solid work on the turn of the bilge, with a glut or chock below each of them, but they were not fastened together. She has not any navel timbers. We suppose that the joints of the second futtocks overlapped in the same style as those below them. As already stated, her stem and forefoot are gone; but a part of her sternpost, and her stern-knee entire, are left. The stern-post is mortised into the keel, and has been bolted through it and the knee; but the iron has been oxidized long since. Instead of deadwood aft she has seven forked timbers, the longest four feet in the stem, with a natural branch on each side, and six inches square. Some of these were half fayed to the keel, but none of them were fastened. Through these, the planking was treenailed. Part of the keelson is now in its place; it is sided ten inches and moulded eight, and was fastened to the keel with four iron bolts, driven between the floor-timbers (not through them) into the keel.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626. Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W. Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, p.11-12. \"Her breadth at present, at four feet two inches depth, from the outside of the timbers, is eleven feet six inches, but when planked, as already stated, it was no doubt twelve feet. She had only three strakes of ceiling, all the rest of the timbers were bare; but she had no doubt a stout clamp for her deck-beams to rest upon and partner-beams as a support to her mast. Her planking was two inches thick, of English oak, fastened with oak treenails. Most of the planks are ten inches wide. The keel has been cut to receive the lower edges of the garboards, which had been spiked to it as well as treenailed through the timbers. The [[starboard]] garboard [[strake]] is now in its place; and this is the only planking we have put on, for the other strakes are somewhat warped. Her outline, however, is perhaps more clearly defined than if she had been planked throughout. It seems to us that after her floor-timbers were laid and planked over, that the other timbers were filled in piece by piece as the planking progressed, which is still a favorite mode of building in some ports of England, and were not jointed together and raised entire before planking. By the appearance of the planks they have been scorched on the inside and then suddenly saturated in water for the purpose of bending them into shape, as a substitute for the modern mode of steaming. The planks and treenails which have not been used by us are preserved with care, and may be seen by those who wish a more minute description of her construction. We suppose she had a heavy plank sheer or covering-board, and that her deck, like her planking, was of English oak. We consider her model superior to that of many vessels of the same size and even larger, which have been recently built in [[Nova Scotia]], and which may be seen in this port every summer.\"</ref>\n\nDennison J. Lawlor was a famous Boston [[Naval architect]] who produced a line plan in which the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' had two masts. The forward mast carried a single square sail, the [[mizzen mast]] (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders'  to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with \"lively rise\" at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat [[Transom (nautical)|transom]], with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor.  Sander's rig takes into account the [[mast step]], and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a [[Barque]].<ref name=\"pilgrimhall.org\"/>\n\n[[Image:Plymouth.Colony Sparrowhawk 1626 photo 1865  600x379.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructed hull of the''Sparrow-Hawk'' on the 'Commons', Boston, Massachusetts]]\nIn 1980, Baker summed up the difficulties and potential confusion when assessing a ship as a potential pinnace candidate.<ref>[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/PSNote28.htm Some Seventeenth-Century Vessels and the Sparrow-Hawk], by William Avery Baker.

Historical notes about pinnaces and shallops used during the early years of the Plymouth Colony. \"The pinnace is perhaps the most confusing of all the early seventeenth-century types of vessels. Pinnace was more of a use than a type name, for almost any vessel could have been a pinnace or tender to a larger one. Generally speaking, pinnaces were lightly built, single-decked, square-sterned vessels suitable for exploring, trading, and light naval duties. On equal lengths pinnaces tended to be narrower than other types. Although primarily sailing vessels, many pinnaces carried sweeps for moving in calms or around harbors. The rigs of pinnaces ranged from the simple single-masted fore-and-aft one of staysail and sprit mainsail to the mizzenmast, and a square sprit-sail under the bowsprit. To confuse matters further, however, open square-sterned pulling boats were called pinnaces at least as early as 1626.\"</ref>  There is no consensus as to what type of ship should be assigned to the ''Sparrow-Hawk''. Decked and with a square stern, she cannot be a shallop. Baker believes her too chunky to be a pinnace, others call her a 'ketch' but this author goes with the department of Nautical Archeology at Texas A&M University that assigns \"Sparrow-Hawk\" to the pinnace category, and representative of the [[Virginia pinnace#Mult-task.2C Multi-use|'small pinnace' design]] in contrast to the 'large pinnace' type.<ref>[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/class/anth318/Class%2014%20-%20Early%20N%20American%20Shipwrecks.htm Anth318: Nautical Archeology of the Americas Class 14], nd.

By August 1863, ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was once again buried beneath the surface for a few months after which she was exposed once again, and then removed above the [[high water]] mark.<ref name=CWL>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626 Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W.Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, pp 27-9.

Her keel was 33' long, breadth amidships was 16.5' and depth was 11'.

We have replaced the keel, [[sternpost]], stern-knee, part of the keelson, all the floor timbers, most of the first [[futtock]]s and the garboard strake on the starboard side; but the stem and fore-foot, the top timbers and deck are gone.

The first futtocks overlap the floor-timbers about two feet, placed alongside of them, forming almost solid work on the turn of the bilge, with a glut or chock below each of them, but they were not fastened together. She has not any navel timbers. We suppose that the joints of the second futtocks overlapped in the same style as those below them. As already stated, her stem and forefoot are gone; but a part of her sternpost, and her stern-knee entire, are left. The stern-post is mortised into the keel, and has been bolted through it and the knee; but the iron has been oxidized long since. Instead of deadwood aft she has seven forked timbers, the longest four feet in the stem, with a natural branch on each side, and six inches square. Some of these were half fayed to the keel, but none of them were fastened. Through these, the planking was treenailed. Part of the keelson is now in its place; it is sided ten inches and moulded eight, and was fastened to the keel with four iron bolts, driven between the floor-timbers (not through them) into the keel.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626. Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W. Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, p.11-12. \"Her breadth at present, at four feet two inches depth, from the outside of the timbers, is eleven feet six inches, but when planked, as already stated, it was no doubt twelve feet. She had only three strakes of ceiling, all the rest of the timbers were bare; but she had no doubt a stout clamp for her deck-beams to rest upon and partner-beams as a support to her mast. Her planking was two inches thick, of English oak, fastened with oak treenails. Most of the planks are ten inches wide. The keel has been cut to receive the lower edges of the garboards, which had been spiked to it as well as treenailed through the timbers. The [[starboard]] garboard [[strake]] is now in its place; and this is the only planking we have put on, for the other strakes are somewhat warped. Her outline, however, is perhaps more clearly defined than if she had been planked throughout. It seems to us that after her floor-timbers were laid and planked over, that the other timbers were filled in piece by piece as the planking progressed, which is still a favorite mode of building in some ports of England, and were not jointed together and raised entire before planking. By the appearance of the planks they have been scorched on the inside and then suddenly saturated in water for the purpose of bending them into shape, as a substitute for the modern mode of steaming. The planks and treenails which have not been used by us are preserved with care, and may be seen by those who wish a more minute description of her construction. We suppose she had a heavy plank sheer or covering-board, and that her deck, like her planking, was of English oak. We consider her model superior to that of many vessels of the same size and even larger, which have been recently built in [[Nova Scotia]], and which may be seen in this port every summer.\"</ref>\n\nDennison J. Lawlor was a famous Boston [[Naval architect]] who produced a line plan in which the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' had two masts. The forward mast carried a single square sail, the [[mizzen mast]] (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders'  to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with \"lively rise\" at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat [[Transom (nautical)|transom]], with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor.  Sander's rig takes into account the [[mast step]], and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a [[Barque]].<ref name=\"pilgrimhall.org\"/>\n\n[[Image:Plymouth.Colony Sparrowhawk 1626 photo 1865  600x379.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructed hull of the''Sparrow-Hawk'' on the 'Commons', Boston, Massachusetts]]\nIn 1980, Baker summed up the difficulties and potential confusion when assessing a ship as a potential pinnace candidate.<ref>[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/PSNote28.htm Some Seventeenth-Century Vessels and the Sparrow-Hawk], by William Avery Baker.

Historical notes about pinnaces and shallops used during the early years of the Plymouth Colony. \"The pinnace is perhaps the most confusing of all the early seventeenth-century types of vessels. Pinnace was more of a use than a type name, for almost any vessel could have been a pinnace or tender to a larger one. Generally speaking, pinnaces were lightly built, single-decked, square-sterned vessels suitable for exploring, trading, and light naval duties. On equal lengths pinnaces tended to be narrower than other types. Although primarily sailing vessels, many pinnaces carried sweeps for moving in calms or around harbors. The rigs of pinnaces ranged from the simple single-masted fore-and-aft one of staysail and sprit mainsail to the mizzenmast, and a square sprit-sail under the bowsprit. To confuse matters further, however, open square-sterned pulling boats were called pinnaces at least as early as 1626.\"</ref>  There is no consensus as to what type of ship should be assigned to the ''Sparrow-Hawk''. Decked and with a square stern, she cannot be a shallop. Baker believes her too chunky to be a pinnace, others call her a 'ketch' but this author goes with the department of Nautical Archeology at Texas A&M University that assigns \"Sparrow-Hawk\" to the pinnace category, and representative of the [[Virginia pinnace#Mult-task.2C Multi-use|'small pinnace' design]] in contrast to the 'large pinnace' type.<ref>[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/class/anth318/Class%2014%20-%20Early%20N%20American%20Shipwrecks.htm Anth318: Nautical Archeology of the Americas Class 14], nd.
