The mask forms a sealed cove and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also [[respirator]]s, though the word ''gas mask'' is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask). The gas mask only protects the user from digesting, inhaling and contact through the eyes (many agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation. Chemical specific filters can last up to 20 hours in an NBC situation.\n\nAirborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, [[mustard gas]] and [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]]) or particulates (such as [[biological warfare|biological agents]]). Many gas masks include protection from both types. Gas masks are used in construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against [[asbestos]] or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling [[hazardous materials]], as in making repairs to leaking equipment or cleaning up after spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks.\n\nDuring demonstrations and protests where [[tear gas]] or [[CS gas]] is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and demonstrators alike. Aside from serving their functional purposes, gas masks are also used as emblems in [[industrial music]], with the most notable example, the [[subgenre]] of [[drum and bass]] called [[neurofunk]]. These emblems are used by [[graffiti]] taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's [[toxic|toxic fumes]], and by [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present.\n\nThe traditional gas mask style with two small circular eye windows originated when the only suitable material for these eye windows was [[glass]] or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]]; as glass is notoriously brittle, glass eye windows had to be kept small and thick. Later, the discovery of [[polycarbonate]] allowed for gas masks to have a panoramic lens although the gas mask did not see this implemented until a long time after polycarbonate began to be used for gas mask lenses. Polycarbonate meant that lenses could be larger and so enabled a larger field of view.  Some have one or two filters screwed (via inlets) onto to the gas mask while others have a large filter (coffee can filter) connected to the gas mask with a hose that is sometimes confused with an ''air-supplied'' ''respirator'' in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered.\n\n==Principles of construction==\n[[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorption]] is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and [[adsorption]] is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards.  Although some form of [[chemical reaction|reaction]] may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive [[electric charge|charges]]. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include [[activated carbon]], and [[zeolite]]s. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire.  While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gases which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy gas mask exercise 021015-N-6996M-589.jpg|US Navy MCU-2/P gas mask system.\nFile:Gas mask 501556 fh000007.jpg|Gas mask used by the French military. The filter cartridge is connected via a flexible hose.\nFile:Gas mask greek.jpg|Greek Infantry with US [[M17 gas mask]]s\n</gallery>\n\n===Safety of old gas masks===\nGas masks have a limited useful lifespan that is related to the absorbent capacity of the filter. Once the filter has been saturated with hazardous chemicals, it ceases to provide protection and the user may be injured. Most gas masks use sealing caps over the air intake and are stored in vacuum sealed bags to prevent the filter from degrading before use, but the protective abilities also degrade as the filter ages or if it is exposed to moisture and heat. Very old unused gas mask filters from World War II may not be effective at all in protecting the user, and can even potentially cause harm to the user due to long-term changes in the filter chemical composition.\n[[File:2 Gasmaskenfilter.jpg|thumb|An asbestos-containing Russian GP-5 filter and a safe modern one in comparison.]]\n\nWorld War II gas masks contained [[chrysotile asbestos]] or [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite_(fibrous_riebeckite)|crocidolite asbestos]] in their filters.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Burns| first = Judith| title = Ban wartime gas masks, schools told| work = BBC News| accessdate = 2018-08-21| date = 2014-05-13| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27391955}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| isbn = 978-1-4612-2496-9| last1 = Dail| first1 = David H.| last2 = Hammar| first2 = Samuel P.| last3 = Colby| first3 = Thomas V.| title = Pulmonary Pathology \u2014 Tumors| date = 2012-12-06 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSgyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1005}}</ref> It is unknown how long for certain the materials were used in filters.

Although the filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in if the filter layer is not damaged, these expired filters and others should be avoided for risk of health. All Russian [[Cold War]] period gas mask filters contain asbestos and should be avoided{{citation_needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nModern gas masks are quite safe and do not use asbestos, but it is still important to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40&nbsp;mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box \"modern type\" masks can be [[ozone cracking|cracked]] and leak. Also, the US C2 canister (black) was shown to contain [[hexavalent chromium]]: the studies by the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, as it is a [[carcinogen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Filter classification ===\n\nThe filter is selected according to the toxic compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|title=Guide for selection and use of filtering devices|format=PDF|publisher=draeger.com|access-date=2013-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526013417/http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Each filter type protects against a particular hazard:\n\n* AX - Low-boiling (\u226465&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* A - High-boiling (>65&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* B - Inorganic gases ([[hydrogen sulfide]], [[chlorine]], [[hydrogen cyanide]])\n* E - [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]] (acidic gases)\n* K - [[Ammonia]] and [[amine]]s\n* CO - [[Carbon monoxide]]\n* Hg - [[mercury (element)|Mercury]]\n* Reactor - [[Iodine]] and [[methyl iodide]] (radioactive)\n* P - Particles; classified as P1, P2, and P3 according to removal efficiency\n* ABEK, ABEK-P3, ABEK-HgP3 or other combination filters against multiple hazards\n*A2B2E2K2-P3 is the highest rating of filter and filters all known chemical, biological substances as well as Alpha and Beta radiation. This excludes Carbon Monoxide and Carbon dioxide\n\nParticle filters are often included, because in many cases, the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling [[asphyxiant]]s, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied (with a SCBA system) from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Monmouth Regimental Museum - QRpedia 5.JPG|thumb|A 1939 Second World War-era baby's gas mask in [[Monmouth Regimental Museum]]. This design covered the whole of the baby except for its legs.]] \nA modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.\n\nMasks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. [[Isoamyl acetate]], a synthetic banana flavourant, and [[camphor]] are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, [[teargas]]es such as [[CN gas|CN]], [[CS gas|CS]], and [[stannic chloride]] in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficiency of the mask.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020175705/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{Further information| MOPP (protective gear) | NBC suit}}\n\n==Reaction and exchange==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThis principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an [[acid]]) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is [[synthetic resin]]s. These can be created with different groups of [[atom]]s (usually called [[functional group]]s) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.\n\nThough it was crude, the [[hypo helmet]] was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:\n\n*The user may be exposed to many types of toxic material. Military personnel are especially prone to being exposed to a diverse range of toxic gases. However, if the mask is for a particular use (such as the protection from a specific toxic material in a factory), then the design can be much simpler and the cost lower.\n*The protection will wear off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption will fill up, and reactive filters will run out of reactive substances. Thus the user only has protection for a limited time, and then he must either replace the filter device in the mask, or use a new mask.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Humboldt gasmask 1799.jpg|A primitive respirator was designed by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1799 for underground mining\nFile:Various gas masks WWI.jpg|Various gas masks employed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during World War I\nFile:1930s gas mask.jpg|[[Finland|Finnish]] civilian gas mask from 1939.

Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Gas Mask Weighing Half As Much.\"] ''Popular Sciences'', March 1944, p. 74.</ref>\n\nGas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as [[blister agent]] or [[nerve agent]], a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical ([[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against [[riot control agent]]s and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by these weapons. During the [[Cold War]] era, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield, and thus troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus protective gear, and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user-comfort, and in compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.). The gas mask has thus now arrived at a 'fourth generation' of development.\n\n[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|Iranian soldier wearing gas mask on the front-line of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]]]\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388), Iraq developed [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|its chemical weapons program]] with the help of Europeans countries (such as Germany and France) {{cn|date=March 2019}}, and used them large-scale against Iranians as well as against Iraqi Kurds. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the [[Republic of Korea]] and [[East Germany]], but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-[[East Asian people]] and the filter only lasted for 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray painting goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still traveled in Europe to buy [[active charcoal]] and models of filters in order to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |title=Iranian Use of Chemical Weapons: A Critical Analysis of Past Allegations |last=Zanders |first=Jean Pascal |date=March 7, 2001 |website=CNS Briefings |publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |access-date=27 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320222016/http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In schools==\n[[File:Viktor Billa Oborona pionerov.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pioneer movement|Pioneers]] in gas masks.

Schools would implement gas mask education and training after the outbreak of a war. Schools would harshly enforce the compulsory carrying of gas masks at all times. Gas mask and air raid drills were closely related and children would be made to wear gas masks in everyday activities, including gymnastics. The wearing of gas masks in the classrooms were especially difficult for teachers as they had trouble distinguishing one child from another. The gas masks became as uniform as the students' uniforms.

The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also [[respirator]]s, though the word ''gas mask'' is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask). The gas mask only protects the user from digesting, inhaling and contact through the eyes (many agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation. Chemical specific filters can last up to 20 hours in an NBC situation.\n\nAirborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, [[mustard gas]] and [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]]) or particulates (such as [[biological warfare|biological agents]]). Many gas masks include protection from both types. Gas masks are used in construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against [[asbestos]] or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling [[hazardous materials]], as in making repairs to leaking equipment or cleaning up after spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks.\n\nDuring demonstrations and protests where [[tear gas]] or [[CS gas]] is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and demonstrators alike. Aside from serving their functional purposes, gas masks are also used as emblems in [[industrial music]], with the most notable example, the [[subgenre]] of [[drum and bass]] called [[neurofunk]]. These emblems are used by [[graffiti]] taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's [[toxic|toxic fumes]], and by [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present.\n\nThe traditional gas mask style with two small circular eye windows originated when the only suitable material for these eye windows was [[glass]] or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]]; as glass is notoriously brittle, glass eye windows had to be kept small and thick. Later, the discovery of [[polycarbonate]] allowed for gas masks to have a panoramic lens although the gas mask did not see this implemented until a long time after polycarbonate began to be used for gas mask lenses. Polycarbonate meant that lenses could be larger and so enabled a larger field of view.  Some have one or two filters screwed (via inlets) onto to the gas mask while others have a large filter (coffee can filter) connected to the gas mask with a hose that is sometimes confused with an ''air-supplied'' ''respirator'' in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered.\n\n==Principles of construction==\n[[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorption]] is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and [[adsorption]] is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards.  Although some form of [[chemical reaction|reaction]] may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive [[electric charge|charges]]. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include [[activated carbon]], and [[zeolite]]s. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire.  While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gases which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:US Navy gas mask exercise 021015-N-6996M-589.jpg|US Navy MCU-2/P gas mask system.\nFile:Gas mask 501556 fh000007.jpg|Gas mask used by the French military. The filter cartridge is connected via a flexible hose.\nFile:Gas mask greek.jpg|Greek Infantry with US [[M17 gas mask]]s\n</gallery>\n\n===Safety of old gas masks===\nGas masks have a limited useful lifespan that is related to the absorbent capacity of the filter. Once the filter has been saturated with hazardous chemicals, it ceases to provide protection and the user may be injured. Most gas masks use sealing caps over the air intake and are stored in vacuum sealed bags to prevent the filter from degrading before use, but the protective abilities also degrade as the filter ages or if it is exposed to moisture and heat. Very old unused gas mask filters from World War II may not be effective at all in protecting the user, and can even potentially cause harm to the user due to long-term changes in the filter chemical composition.\n[[File:2 Gasmaskenfilter.jpg|thumb|An asbestos-containing Russian GP-5 filter and a safe modern one in comparison.]]\n\nWorld War II gas masks contained [[chrysotile asbestos]] or [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite_(fibrous_riebeckite)|crocidolite asbestos]] in their filters.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Burns| first = Judith| title = Ban wartime gas masks, schools told| work = BBC News| accessdate = 2018-08-21| date = 2014-05-13| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27391955}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| isbn = 978-1-4612-2496-9| last1 = Dail| first1 = David H.| last2 = Hammar| first2 = Samuel P.| last3 = Colby| first3 = Thomas V.| title = Pulmonary Pathology \u2014 Tumors| date = 2012-12-06 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSgyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1005}}</ref> It is unknown how long for certain the materials were used in filters.

Although the filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in if the filter layer is not damaged, these expired filters and others should be avoided for risk of health. All Russian [[Cold War]] period gas mask filters contain asbestos and should be avoided{{citation_needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nModern gas masks are quite safe and do not use asbestos, but it is still important to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40&nbsp;mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box \"modern type\" masks can be [[ozone cracking|cracked]] and leak. Also, the US C2 canister (black) was shown to contain [[hexavalent chromium]]: the studies by the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, as it is a [[carcinogen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Filter classification ===\n\nThe filter is selected according to the toxic compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|title=Guide for selection and use of filtering devices|format=PDF|publisher=draeger.com|access-date=2013-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526013417/http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/09/10010967/guide_for_selection_and_use_of_filtering_devices_9045782_en.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Each filter type protects against a particular hazard:\n\n* AX - Low-boiling (\u226465&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* A - High-boiling (>65&nbsp;\u00b0C) organic compounds\n* B - Inorganic gases ([[hydrogen sulfide]], [[chlorine]], [[hydrogen cyanide]])\n* E - [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]] (acidic gases)\n* K - [[Ammonia]] and [[amine]]s\n* CO - [[Carbon monoxide]]\n* Hg - [[mercury (element)|Mercury]]\n* Reactor - [[Iodine]] and [[methyl iodide]] (radioactive)\n* P - Particles; classified as P1, P2, and P3 according to removal efficiency\n* ABEK, ABEK-P3, ABEK-HgP3 or other combination filters against multiple hazards\n*A2B2E2K2-P3 is the highest rating of filter and filters all known chemical, biological substances as well as Alpha and Beta radiation. This excludes Carbon Monoxide and Carbon dioxide\n\nParticle filters are often included, because in many cases, the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling [[asphyxiant]]s, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied (with a SCBA system) from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Monmouth Regimental Museum - QRpedia 5.JPG|thumb|A 1939 Second World War-era baby's gas mask in [[Monmouth Regimental Museum]]. This design covered the whole of the baby except for its legs.]] \nA modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.\n\nMasks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. [[Isoamyl acetate]], a synthetic banana flavourant, and [[camphor]] are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, [[teargas]]es such as [[CN gas|CN]], [[CS gas|CS]], and [[stannic chloride]] in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficiency of the mask.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020175705/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN32-4006.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{Further information| MOPP (protective gear) | NBC suit}}\n\n==Reaction and exchange==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThis principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an [[acid]]) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is [[synthetic resin]]s. These can be created with different groups of [[atom]]s (usually called [[functional group]]s) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.\n\nThough it was crude, the [[hypo helmet]] was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:\n\n*The user may be exposed to many types of toxic material. Military personnel are especially prone to being exposed to a diverse range of toxic gases. However, if the mask is for a particular use (such as the protection from a specific toxic material in a factory), then the design can be much simpler and the cost lower.\n*The protection will wear off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption will fill up, and reactive filters will run out of reactive substances. Thus the user only has protection for a limited time, and then he must either replace the filter device in the mask, or use a new mask.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Humboldt gasmask 1799.jpg|A primitive respirator was designed by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1799 for underground mining\nFile:Various gas masks WWI.jpg|Various gas masks employed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during World War I\nFile:1930s gas mask.jpg|[[Finland|Finnish]] civilian gas mask from 1939.

These waste materials were collected from the public in recycling programs to assist the war effort.<ref>''Once Worthless Things that have Suddenly Become of Value'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, December 1918, page 80, scanned by [https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA80 Google Books]</ref>\n\nThe first effective filtering [[activated charcoal]] gas mask in the world was invented in 1915 by Russian chemist [[Nikolay Zelinsky]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kozhevnikov|first=A B|title=Stalin's great science: the times and adventures of Soviet physicists|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l1Ha_opwB68C|accessdate=2009-04-28|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2004|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn= 978-1-86094-419-2|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BunkArt-Horse-Gas-Mask.jpg|thumb|First World War gas mask for horses]]\n[[Image:Soldaty 267 Duhovshinskogo polka.jpg|thumb|1916, Russian soldiers]]\nAlso in World War I, since dogs were frequently used on the front lines, a special type of gas mask was developed that dogs were trained to wear.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75 \"Gas-Masks for Dogs / Dumb Heroes of the Fighting Front\"], ''[[Popular Science]]'' monthly, December 1918, page 75, Scanned by Google Books</ref> Other gas masks were developed during World War I and the time following for horses in the various mounted units that operated near the front lines.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=JJlxTqniIc_AtgfAoMD-CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Gas Masks to Guard Horses and Dogs in War\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1934, bottom pg. 75</ref> In America thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops.

It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed on the side of the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Gas Mask Weighing Half As Much.\"] ''Popular Sciences'', March 1944, p. 74.</ref>\n\nGas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as [[blister agent]] or [[nerve agent]], a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical ([[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against [[riot control agent]]s and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by these weapons. During the [[Cold War]] era, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield, and thus troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus protective gear, and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user-comfort, and in compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.). The gas mask has thus now arrived at a 'fourth generation' of development.\n\n[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|Iranian soldier wearing gas mask on the front-line of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]]]\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388), Iraq developed [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|its chemical weapons program]] with the help of Europeans countries (such as Germany and France) {{cn|date=March 2019}}, and used them large-scale against Iranians as well as against Iraqi Kurds. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the [[Republic of Korea]] and [[East Germany]], but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-[[East Asian people]] and the filter only lasted for 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray painting goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still traveled in Europe to buy [[active charcoal]] and models of filters in order to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |title=Iranian Use of Chemical Weapons: A Critical Analysis of Past Allegations |last=Zanders |first=Jean Pascal |date=March 7, 2001 |website=CNS Briefings |publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |access-date=27 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320222016/http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In schools==\n[[File:Viktor Billa Oborona pionerov.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pioneer movement|Pioneers]] in gas masks.

Schools would implement gas mask education and training after the outbreak of a war. Schools would harshly enforce the compulsory carrying of gas masks at all times. Gas mask and air raid drills were closely related and children would be made to wear gas masks in everyday activities, including gymnastics. The wearing of gas masks in the classrooms were especially difficult for teachers as they had trouble distinguishing one child from another. The gas masks became as uniform as the students' uniforms. Other civilians learned the use of a gas mask through posters, pamphlets, and radio lectures, but children learned through cartoons and rhymes such as \"[[coughs and sneezes spread diseases]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ant&AN=XANL668213267&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login|author=|date=|website=search.ebscohost.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|Assigned Protection Factors]]\n* [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators]]\n* [[GP-5 gas mask]]\n* [[Hopcalite]]\n* [[M2 Gas Mask]]\n* [[M40 Field Protective Mask]]\n* [[M50 joint service general purpose mask]]\n* [[C-4 Protective Mask]]\n* [[NBC suit]]\n* [[PH helmet]]\n* [[Plague doctor costume|Plague doctor's outfit]]\n* [[Respirator]]\n* [[Respirator fit test]]\n* [[Respirators testing in the workplaces]]\n* [[Smoke hood]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation |ref=harv |last1=Wetherell |first1=Anthony |last2=Mathers |first2=George |year=2007 |contribution=Respiratory Protection |editor-last=Marrs |editor-first=Timothy |editor2-last=Maynard |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Sidell |editor3-first=Frederick |title=Chemical Warfare Agents: Toxicology and Treatment|location=New York |publisher=Wiley |pages=157\u2013174 |isbn=978-0470013595}}\n* {{citation |ref=harv |last1=Mayer-Maguire |first1=Thomas |last2=Baker |first2=Brian |year=2015 |title=British Military Respirators and Anti-Gas Equipment of the Two World Wars |publisher=Crowood}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Gas mask}}\n*[http://science.howstuffworks.com/gas-mask.htm/printable How Stuff Works - Gas Masks] Science.com\n*[http://inventors.about.com/od/gstartinventions/a/gasmask.htm The History of Gas Masks] inventors.about.com, About, Inc. updated August 6, 2016\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html Respirator Fact Sheet]\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html CBRN SCBA NIOSH Approved Respirators] List of NIOSH Approved CBRN SCBA respirators\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gas Mask}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:Iranian inventions]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military personal equipment]]\n[[Category:1914 introductions]]\n[[Category:Riot control equipment]]\n[[Category:Gas masks|*Main]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7d:2884:c800:c433:43d0:5dd4:2247", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mask"}
