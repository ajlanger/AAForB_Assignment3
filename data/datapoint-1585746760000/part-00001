At club level, he played football in both France and England with [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. At international level, he represented the [[France national football team|France national team]], with whom he won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2000]], and the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup]], representing his nation at a total of three editions of both the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA European Championship]]; he also reached the final of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], after which he retired from international football.\n\nNicknamed ''Le Divin Chauve'' (\"The Divine Bald One\"), due to his trademark shaved head,<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/><ref name=\"grado zero\"/><ref name=\"Barthez cries\"/> Barthez is France's most capped player in the [[FIFA World Cup]], with 17 appearances at the finals and shares the record for the most [[FIFA World Cup records#Goalkeeping|World Cup finals clean sheets]] with [[Peter Shilton]], with ten.<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/><ref name=\"grado zero\"/> In club football, he won the [[UEFA Champions League]] with Olympique Marseille in [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]] as well as several [[Ligue 1]] and [[Premier League]] titles. After retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Marseille===\nBorn in [[Lavelanet]], France, Barthez made his first division debut for [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] on 21 September 1991, against [[AS Nancy|Nancy]]. He joined [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 1992, and won both the French championship and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] at the end of his first season in Marseille, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over [[A.C.

He stayed with the club in Division 2 for the 1994\u201395 season despite many offers from elite French clubs, helping Marseille to the title and to earn promotion to the first division.<ref>{{cite web |first=Maxime |last=Dupuis |title=Barthez en dix dates |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/story_sto979355.shtml |work=Eurosport.fr |publisher=Eurosport |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Monaco===\nIn 1995, Barthez joined [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and won [[Ligue 1]] titles in 1997 and 2000. He also played in [[Jean Tigana]]'s talented Monaco side which famously put his future club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] out of the Champions League in 1998 on away goals after a 1\u20131 draw at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-monaco-and-bust-for-sorry-united-1151168.html\n|title=Monaco and bust for sorry United\n|newspaper=The Independent \n|date=19 March 1998 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester United===\nAs a result of Barthez's success in the World Cup and the Euros, he caught the attention of Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], who was searching for a star goalkeeper to replace the recently departed [[Peter Schmeichel]], as Ferguson did not think that the previous season's goalkeeper, [[Mark Bosnich]], was a long-term replacement.

His first season was a triumph as he answered all the questions about how he would handle rainy [[Manchester]] compared to sunny [[Monaco]].

After dropping a cross from [[Robbie Keane]], Barthez deliberately kicked out with his foot at [[Ian Harte]], who fell to the ground on the edge of six yard box, and the referee awarded a penalty to Leeds.

Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]]. Derby forward [[Malcolm Christie]] looked to have sealed his [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]], but referee [[Steve Dunn (referee)|Steve Dunn]] controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1847978.stm |title=Derby thwart Man Utd |date=3 March 2002 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nHe was also noted for playing mind games before opposition players took a penalty. The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] came to Old Trafford.

The decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet's walking out of the national squad before the tournament, though he was to return one day later. The move was viewed by some as a desire to keep the veterans of France's 1998 World Cup victory on the team.

France is now one of only four nations (along with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]) to have shut Brazil out twice in the World Cup finals, and the first to have done it in consecutive matches, both times with Barthez in goal.<ref name=\"grado zero\"/>\n\nBarthez again kept another clean sheet \u2013 his fourth of the tournament<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/> \u2013 in the semi-final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] (with Zinedine Zidane's penalty shot the winning goal), though he appeared in questionable form.

driver who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. At club level, he played football in both France and England with [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. At international level, he represented the [[France national football team|France national team]], with whom he won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2000]], and the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup]], representing his nation at a total of three editions of both the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA European Championship]]; he also reached the final of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], after which he retired from international football.\n\nNicknamed ''Le Divin Chauve'' (\"The Divine Bald One\"), due to his trademark shaved head,<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/><ref name=\"grado zero\"/><ref name=\"Barthez cries\"/> Barthez is France's most capped player in the [[FIFA World Cup]], with 17 appearances at the finals and shares the record for the most [[FIFA World Cup records#Goalkeeping|World Cup finals clean sheets]] with [[Peter Shilton]], with ten.<ref name=\"Behind the World Cup record\"/><ref name=\"grado zero\"/> In club football, he won the [[UEFA Champions League]] with Olympique Marseille in [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]] as well as several [[Ligue 1]] and [[Premier League]] titles. After retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Marseille===\nBorn in [[Lavelanet]], France, Barthez made his first division debut for [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] on 21 September 1991, against [[AS Nancy|Nancy]]. He joined [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 1992, and won both the French championship and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] at the end of his first season in Marseille, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over [[A.C. Milan]] in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|final of the latter competition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1992/matches/round=50/match=50054/postmatch/lineups/index.html|title=Marseille 1-0 Milan|publisher=UEFA.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> The 1993 victory made him the youngest goalkeeper to win a Champions League title until [[Iker Casillas]] did so in 2000.\n\nMarseille, however, would be stripped of their domestic title, though not of the Champions League crown, due to their involvement in a domestic [[match fixing]] scandal, and a year later (1994) would suffer a forced relegation to the second division due to a related financial bankruptcy. He stayed with the club in Division 2 for the 1994\u201395 season despite many offers from elite French clubs, helping Marseille to the title and to earn promotion to the first division.<ref>{{cite web |first=Maxime |last=Dupuis |title=Barthez en dix dates |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/story_sto979355.shtml |work=Eurosport.fr |publisher=Eurosport |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Monaco===\nIn 1995, Barthez joined [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and won [[Ligue 1]] titles in 1997 and 2000. He also played in [[Jean Tigana]]'s talented Monaco side which famously put his future club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] out of the Champions League in 1998 on away goals after a 1\u20131 draw at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-monaco-and-bust-for-sorry-united-1151168.html\n|title=Monaco and bust for sorry United\n|newspaper=The Independent \n|date=19 March 1998 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester United===\nAs a result of Barthez's success in the World Cup and the Euros, he caught the attention of Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], who was searching for a star goalkeeper to replace the recently departed [[Peter Schmeichel]], as Ferguson did not think that the previous season's goalkeeper, [[Mark Bosnich]], was a long-term replacement.

His first season was a triumph as he answered all the questions about how he would handle rainy [[Manchester]] compared to sunny [[Monaco]]. Barthez performed brilliantly throughout the season and became a crowd favourite. The fans loved his eccentric behaviour, his taunting dribbles and step-overs past opposing strikers,<ref name=\"losing\"/> and most importantly, his remarkable reaction saves.<ref name=\"Fergie's men survive Ipswich\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/891902.stm|title=Fergie's men survive Ipswich scare|work=BBC Sport|date=22 August 2000|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Saving grace\"/> Very often it was critical saves that kept United from defeat or dropping valuable points,<ref name=\"Fergie's men survive Ipswich\"/> helping United to the [[2000\u201301 FA Premier League]] title, their third in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/59013|title=Man Utd win their third consecutive Premier League title and their seventh overall|publisher=www.premierleague.com|date=31 May 2001|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/History/History-By-Decade/History-By-Decade/2014/Oct/manchester-united-history-2000-to-2009.aspx|title=United history: 2000 to 2009|publisher=www.manutd.com|access-date=16 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121020257/http://www.manutd.com/en/History/History-By-Decade/History-By-Decade/2014/Oct/manchester-united-history-2000-to-2009.aspx|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA memorable incident happened when Manchester United faced [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in March 2001. After dropping a cross from [[Robbie Keane]], Barthez deliberately kicked out with his foot at [[Ian Harte]], who fell to the ground on the edge of six yard box, and the referee awarded a penalty to Leeds. Harte stepped up but Barthez made a low, one-handed save to his right.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/3000096/Barthez-survives-to-save-United.html |title=Barthez survives to save United |date=3 May 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group }}</ref> The only blemish in his first season was his failed attempt at \"psyching out\" [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]'s [[Paolo Di Canio]] in the [[2000\u201301 FA Cup|FA Cup]] Fourth Round; Di Canio beat the offside trap, while Barthez stood still with his hand up expecting the referee to blow his whistle, or Di Canio to stop.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1142505.stm |title=Di Canio: Barthez did not fool me |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Di Canio continued and scored the only goal of the game,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1140138.stm |title=Di Canio sinks Man Utd |date=28 January 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Di Canio takes his chance |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jan/29/match.sport11 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 }}</ref> and later said it was \"better to score and then see whether the goalkeeper is right or wrong\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Di Canio - Barthez didn't confuse my brain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jan/29/newsstory.sport7 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|2001\u201302 season]] was split into two parts for him. The first half was a nightmare. The Frenchman seemed to be taking some unnecessary risks outside his penalty area, and his antics began to have consequences that allowed unneeded goals for opposing teams. He was at fault for two goals in a 3\u20132 home defeat by [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]] in October 2001.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/3014964/Champions-League-United-exposed-by-Barthez-blunders.html |title=Champions League: United exposed by Barthez blunders |date=17 October 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group }}</ref> Ferguson said how \"eventually he will get caught out\" and it wouldn't happen again.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/3015035/Champions-League-Ferguson-gets-tough-on-Barthez.html |title=Champions League: Ferguson gets tough on Barthez |date=18 October 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group }}</ref> But another couple of late errors against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a 3\u20131 defeat at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] the following month put much pressure on Barthez, with two goals gifted to [[Thierry Henry]], one of which came from a mis-hit clearance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1671459.stm |title=Barthez errors gift Arsenal win |date=25 November 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Barthez was at the centre of further controversy when, after already being on a yellow card following an argument with [[Matthew Upson]], he was caught by television cameras raising his middle fingers behind his back towards the Arsenal supporters, who had been taunting him for his errors towards the end of the match; the incident was missed by the referee [[Peter Jones (referee)|Peter Jones]], however.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-defeat-a-disaster-says-ferguson-9175298.html|title=Arsenal defeat 'a disaster', says Ferguson|newspaper=The Independent|author1=Gordon Tynan|date=27 November 2001|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> There was much speculation as to what was the source of Barthez's decline, and critics such as the [[BBC]]'s [[Phil McNulty]] urged him to be dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1676691.stm |title=Fabien's follies |date=26 November 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Sir Alex Ferguson, however, had faith in his goalkeeper and stuck by him. Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]]. Derby forward [[Malcolm Christie]] looked to have sealed his [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]], but referee [[Steve Dunn (referee)|Steve Dunn]] controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1847978.stm |title=Derby thwart Man Utd |date=3 March 2002 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nHe was also noted for playing mind games before opposition players took a penalty. The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] came to Old Trafford. As [[Muzzy Izzet]] prepared to take a penalty, Barthez stood aside from the goal, with his hands behind him on the post.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1663008.stm |title=Ferguson strikes back |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Izzet, tired of waiting, slotted the ball in the bottom corner, but referee [[Andy D'Urso]] made him retake the penalty, this time with Barthez in goal.
