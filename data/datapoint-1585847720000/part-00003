The cave is is 58m long. Local men Micah Salt and Robert Milletts excavated the cave in the 1880s and 1890s, after boys found a bear's skull in the cave. They discovered [[Roman Empire|Roman]] artefacts, including bronze jewelery, enamelled brooches, pottery fragments, coins and an iron and bone knife.
