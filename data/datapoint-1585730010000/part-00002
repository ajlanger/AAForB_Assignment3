Born into a prominent [[Genoa|Genovese]] family, he entered the church and was made [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishop]] in 1467, before being elevated to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. He was elected Pope in 1484, as a compromise candidate, after a stormy conclave.\n\nSon of the viceroy of Naples, Battista spent his early years at the Neapolitan court. He became a priest in the retinue of Cardinal Calandrini, half-brother to Pope Nicholas V (1447\u201355), Bishop of Savona under Pope Paul II, and with the support of [[Pope Julius II|Giuliano Della Rovere]], a cardinal. After intense politicking by Della Rovere, Cibo was elected pope in 1484. [[Ferdinand I of Naples|King Ferrante of Naples]] had supported Cybo's competitor, Rodrigo Borgia. The following year, Pope Innocent supported the barons in their [[Conspiracy of the Barons|failed revolt]].\n\nIn March 1489, [[Cem]], the captive brother of [[Bayezid II]], the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], came into Innocent's custody.

In 1467, he was made Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Savona-Noli|Savona]] by [[Pope Paul II]], but exchanged this see in 1472 for that of Molfetta in south-eastern Italy. In 1473, with the support of [[Pope Julius II|Giuliano Della Rovere]], later [[Pope Julius II]], he was made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], whom he succeeded on 29 August 1484 as Pope Innocent VIII.<ref name=Weber>{{cite CE1913 |last=Weber |first=Nicholas |wstitle=Pope Innocent VIII |volume=8}}</ref>\n\n==Papal election==\n{{main|Papal conclave, 1484}}\nThe [[Papal conclave, 1484|papal conclave]] of 1484 was rife with factions, while gangs rioted in the streets. In order to prevent the election of the Venetian Cardinal [[marco Barbo|Barbo]], Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, on the evening before the election, after the cardinals had retired for the night, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, nephew of the late Pope, and Cardinal Borgia, the Vice-Chancellor, visited a number of cardinals and secured their votes with the promise of various benefices.<ref name=csun>John Paul Adams, [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1484.html \"Sede Vacante August 12, 1484\u2014August 29, 1484\", California State University, Northridge], retrieved: 3 August 2016.</ref>\n\nIt was claimed that Cardinal della Rovere met secretly with Cardinal Marco Barbo in order to secure him more votes to become pope if he was promised a residence, though Barbo refused in fear it would make the conclave invalid due to simony. Cardinal della Rovere then met with Borgia, who disliked Barbo and wished to block his election, with an offer to turn their votes over to Cib\u00f2, promising them benefits for doing so.<ref name=csun/>\n\n==Papacy==\nShortly after his coronation Innocent VIII addressed a fruitless summons to [[Christendom]] to unite in a [[crusade]] against the Turks. A protracted conflict with King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] was the principal obstacle. Ferdinand's oppressive government led in 1485 to a rebellion of the aristocracy, known as the Conspiracy of the Barons, which included Francesco Coppola and Antonello Sanseverino of Salerno and was supported by Pope Innocent VIII. Innocent excommunicated him in 1489 and invited King [[Charles VIII of France]] to come to Italy with an army and take possession of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], a disastrous political event for the Italian peninsula as a whole. The immediate conflict was not ended until 1494, after Innocent VIII's death.\n\n===Relations with the Ottoman Empire===\n[[Bayezid II]] ruled as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512. His rule was contested by his brother [[Sultan Cem|Cem]], who sought the support of the Mamluks of Egypt. Defeated by his brother's armies, Cem sought protection from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]] in Rhodes. Prince Cem offered perpetual peace between the Ottoman Empire and Christendom. However, the sultan paid the Knights a large amount to keep Cem captive. Cem was later sent to the castle of Pierre d'Aubusson in France. Sultan Bayezid sent a messenger to France and requested Cem to be kept there; he agreed to make an annual payment in gold for his brother's expenses.\n\nIn March 1489, Cem was transferred to the custody of Innocent VIII. Cem's presence in Rome was useful because whenever Bayezid intended to launch a military campaign against the Christian nations of the [[Balkans]], the Pope would threaten to release his brother. In exchange for maintaining the custody of Cem, Bayezid paid Innocent VIII 120,000 crowns, a relic of the [[Holy Lance#Vatican lance|Holy Lance]] and an annual fee of 45,000 ducats.<ref>Duffy, Eamon (2006).

Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: A Documentary History. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|0-8122-1751-9}}, p.177</ref> who disputed his authority to work in their dioceses. Some scholars view the bull as \"clearly political\", motivated by jurisdictional disputes between the local German Catholic priests and clerics from the Office of the Inquisition who answered more directly to the pope.<ref>Darst, David H. (15 October 1979). \"Witchcraft in Spain: The Testimony of Mart\u00edn de Casta\u00f1ega's Treatise on Superstition and Witchcraft (1529)\".

Kramer would later claim that witchcraft was to blame for bad weather. Both the papal letter appended to the work and the supposed endorsement of Cologne University for it are problematic. The letter of Innocent VIII is not an approval of the book to which it was appended, but rather a charge to inquisitors to investigate diabolical sorcery and a warning to those who might impede them in their duty, that is, a papal letter in the by then conventional tradition established by John XXII and other popes through Eugenius IV and Nicholas V (1447\u201355).<ref>cf., Joyy et al., Witchcraft and Magic In Europe, p. 239 (2002).</ref>\n\n===Other events===\nIn 1487, Innocent confirmed [[Tomas de Torquemada]] as Grand Inquisitor of [[Spain]].

Alberto de' Capitanei, archdeacon of [[Cremona]], responded to the bull by organizing a crusade to fulfill its order and launched an offensive in the provinces of [[Dauphin\u00e9]] and [[Piedmont]]. [[Charles I, Duke of Savoy]] eventually interfered to save his territories from further confusion and promised the Vaudois peace, but not before the offensive had devastated the area and many of the Vaudois fled to [[Provence]] and south to Italy.\n\nThe noted [[Franciscan]] theologian [[Angelo Carletti di Chivasso]], whom Innocent in 1491 appointed as Apostolic Nuncio and Commissary, conjointly with the [[Bishop of Mauriana]], was involved in reaching the peaceful agreement between Catholics and Waldensians.<ref name=Donovan>{{cite CE1913|last=Donovan |first=Stephen |wstitle=Bl.

He was said to have been given the world's first [[blood transfusion]] by his Jewish physician [[Giacomo di San Genesio]], who had him bathe in the blood of three 10-year-old boys. The boys subsequently died.<ref>Burg G. (2012). History of sexually transmitted infections (STI).

The fact is that he died seven days before the departure of [[Christopher Columbus]] for his supposedly first voyage over the Atlantic, raising speculations that Columbus actually traveled before the known date and re-discovered the Americas for the Europeans before the supposed date of 12 October 1492. The Italian journalist and writer [[Ruggero Marino]], in his book ''Cristoforo Colombo e il Papa tradito'' (transl. ''Christopher Columbus and the betrayed Pope'') is convinced of this after having studied Columbus's papers for over 25 years.<ref>{{cite web |first= Nicol\u00f2 |last=Carnimeo |publisher=ilfattoquotidiano.it2014 |url= http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/05/19/haiti-i-dubbi-sul-ritrovamento-della-santa-maria-di-colombo/# |title=Haiti, i dubbi sul ritrovamento della Santa Maria di Colombo (Doubts over the finding of the Santa Maria of Colombo)|date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nInnocent had two illegitimate children born before he entered the clergy<ref name=Weber/> \"towards whom his [[nepotism]] had been as lavish as it was shameless\".<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Innocent/Innocent VIII|volume=14|pages=581\u2013582}} (sub-section within article \"innocent\", pp. 577\u2013583)</ref> In 1487 he married his elder son [[Franceschetto Cybo]] (d. 1519) to [[Maddalena di Lorenzo de' Medici|Maddalena de' Medici]] (1473\u20131528), the daughter of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who in return obtained the cardinal's hat for his thirteen-year-old son Giovanni, later [[Pope Leo X]].

Ferrario|location=Milan|page=10}}</ref> After the death of King Alfonso, friction between Giovanni Battista and the Archbishop of Genoa decided him to resign his Canonry, and to go to [[Padua]] and then to Rome for his education.\n\n==Early career==\nIn Rome he became a priest in the retinue of cardinal Calandrini, half-brother to [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1447\u201355). In 1467, he was made Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Savona-Noli|Savona]] by [[Pope Paul II]], but exchanged this see in 1472 for that of Molfetta in south-eastern Italy. In 1473, with the support of [[Pope Julius II|Giuliano Della Rovere]], later [[Pope Julius II]], he was made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], whom he succeeded on 29 August 1484 as Pope Innocent VIII.<ref name=Weber>{{cite CE1913 |last=Weber |first=Nicholas |wstitle=Pope Innocent VIII |volume=8}}</ref>\n\n==Papal election==\n{{main|Papal conclave, 1484}}\nThe [[Papal conclave, 1484|papal conclave]] of 1484 was rife with factions, while gangs rioted in the streets. In order to prevent the election of the Venetian Cardinal [[marco Barbo|Barbo]], Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, on the evening before the election, after the cardinals had retired for the night, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, nephew of the late Pope, and Cardinal Borgia, the Vice-Chancellor, visited a number of cardinals and secured their votes with the promise of various benefices.<ref name=csun>John Paul Adams, [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1484.html \"Sede Vacante August 12, 1484\u2014August 29, 1484\", California State University, Northridge], retrieved: 3 August 2016.</ref>\n\nIt was claimed that Cardinal della Rovere met secretly with Cardinal Marco Barbo in order to secure him more votes to become pope if he was promised a residence, though Barbo refused in fear it would make the conclave invalid due to simony. Cardinal della Rovere then met with Borgia, who disliked Barbo and wished to block his election, with an offer to turn their votes over to Cib\u00f2, promising them benefits for doing so.<ref name=csun/>\n\n==Papacy==\nShortly after his coronation Innocent VIII addressed a fruitless summons to [[Christendom]] to unite in a [[crusade]] against the Turks. A protracted conflict with King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] was the principal obstacle. Ferdinand's oppressive government led in 1485 to a rebellion of the aristocracy, known as the Conspiracy of the Barons, which included Francesco Coppola and Antonello Sanseverino of Salerno and was supported by Pope Innocent VIII. Innocent excommunicated him in 1489 and invited King [[Charles VIII of France]] to come to Italy with an army and take possession of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], a disastrous political event for the Italian peninsula as a whole. The immediate conflict was not ended until 1494, after Innocent VIII's death.\n\n===Relations with the Ottoman Empire===\n[[Bayezid II]] ruled as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512. His rule was contested by his brother [[Sultan Cem|Cem]], who sought the support of the Mamluks of Egypt. Defeated by his brother's armies, Cem sought protection from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]] in Rhodes. Prince Cem offered perpetual peace between the Ottoman Empire and Christendom. However, the sultan paid the Knights a large amount to keep Cem captive. Cem was later sent to the castle of Pierre d'Aubusson in France. Sultan Bayezid sent a messenger to France and requested Cem to be kept there; he agreed to make an annual payment in gold for his brother's expenses.\n\nIn March 1489, Cem was transferred to the custody of Innocent VIII. Cem's presence in Rome was useful because whenever Bayezid intended to launch a military campaign against the Christian nations of the [[Balkans]], the Pope would threaten to release his brother. In exchange for maintaining the custody of Cem, Bayezid paid Innocent VIII 120,000 crowns, a relic of the [[Holy Lance#Vatican lance|Holy Lance]] and an annual fee of 45,000 ducats.<ref>Duffy, Eamon (2006).

Some scholars view the bull as \"clearly political\", motivated by jurisdictional disputes between the local German Catholic priests and clerics from the Office of the Inquisition who answered more directly to the pope.<ref>Darst, David H.

Kramer would later claim that witchcraft was to blame for bad weather. Both the papal letter appended to the work and the supposed endorsement of Cologne University for it are problematic. The letter of Innocent VIII is not an approval of the book to which it was appended, but rather a charge to inquisitors to investigate diabolical sorcery and a warning to those who might impede them in their duty, that is, a papal letter in the by then conventional tradition established by John XXII and other popes through Eugenius IV and Nicholas V (1447\u201355).<ref>cf., Joyy et al., Witchcraft and Magic In Europe, p. 239 (2002).</ref>\n\n===Other events===\nIn 1487, Innocent confirmed [[Tomas de Torquemada]] as Grand Inquisitor of [[Spain]].

Alberto de' Capitanei, archdeacon of [[Cremona]], responded to the bull by organizing a crusade to fulfill its order and launched an offensive in the provinces of [[Dauphin\u00e9]] and [[Piedmont]]. [[Charles I, Duke of Savoy]] eventually interfered to save his territories from further confusion and promised the Vaudois peace, but not before the offensive had devastated the area and many of the Vaudois fled to [[Provence]] and south to Italy.\n\nThe noted [[Franciscan]] theologian [[Angelo Carletti di Chivasso]], whom Innocent in 1491 appointed as Apostolic Nuncio and Commissary, conjointly with the [[Bishop of Mauriana]], was involved in reaching the peaceful agreement between Catholics and Waldensians.<ref name=Donovan>{{cite CE1913|last=Donovan |first=Stephen |wstitle=Bl.

His successor would later turn the building into the [[Cortile del Belvedere]]. In season, he hunted at Castello della Magliana, which he enlarged.

He was said to have been given the world's first [[blood transfusion]] by his Jewish physician [[Giacomo di San Genesio]], who had him bathe in the blood of three 10-year-old boys. The boys subsequently died.<ref>Burg G. (2012). History of sexually transmitted infections (STI).

The fact is that he died seven days before the departure of [[Christopher Columbus]] for his supposedly first voyage over the Atlantic, raising speculations that Columbus actually traveled before the known date and re-discovered the Americas for the Europeans before the supposed date of 12 October 1492. The Italian journalist and writer [[Ruggero Marino]], in his book ''Cristoforo Colombo e il Papa tradito'' (transl. ''Christopher Columbus and the betrayed Pope'') is convinced of this after having studied Columbus's papers for over 25 years.<ref>{{cite web |first= Nicol\u00f2 |last=Carnimeo |publisher=ilfattoquotidiano.it2014 |url= http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/05/19/haiti-i-dubbi-sul-ritrovamento-della-santa-maria-di-colombo/# |title=Haiti, i dubbi sul ritrovamento della Santa Maria di Colombo (Doubts over the finding of the Santa Maria of Colombo)|date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nInnocent had two illegitimate children born before he entered the clergy<ref name=Weber/> \"towards whom his [[nepotism]] had been as lavish as it was shameless\".<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Innocent/Innocent VIII|volume=14|pages=581\u2013582}} (sub-section within article \"innocent\", pp. 577\u2013583)</ref> In 1487 he married his elder son [[Franceschetto Cybo]] (d. 1519) to [[Maddalena di Lorenzo de' Medici|Maddalena de' Medici]] (1473\u20131528), the daughter of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who in return obtained the cardinal's hat for his thirteen-year-old son Giovanni, later [[Pope Leo X]].
