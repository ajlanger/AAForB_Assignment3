{"title_page": "Higgs mechanism", "text_new": "{{Standard model of particle physics}}\n{{Quantum field theory}}\nIn the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], the '''Higgs mechanism''' is essential to explain the [[mass generation mechanism|generation mechanism]] of the property \"[[mass]]\" for [[gauge boson]]s. Without the Higgs mechanism, all [[boson]]s (one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions) would be considered [[Massless particle|massless]], but measurements show that the [[W boson|W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>\u2212</sup>]], and [[Z boson|Z<sup>0</sup> bosons]] actually have relatively large masses of around 80&nbsp;GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds a [[quantum field]] (the [[Higgs boson|Higgs field]]) that permeates all space to the Standard Model. Below some extremely high temperature, the field causes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] during interactions. The breaking of symmetry triggers the Higgs mechanism, causing the bosons it interacts with to have mass. In the Standard Model, the phrase \"Higgs mechanism\" refers specifically to the generation of masses for the [[W and Z bosons|W<sup>\u00b1</sup>, and Z]] [[Weak force|weak]] gauge bosons through [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]] symmetry breaking.<ref name=PDG>{{cite web |author1=Bernardi, G. |author2=Carena, M. |author3=Junk, T. |title=Higgs bosons: Theory and searches |publisher=Particle Data Group |series=Review: Hypothetical particles and Concepts |year=2007 |url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/higgs_s055.pdf}}</ref> The [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] announced results consistent with the Higgs particle on 14&nbsp;March 2013, making it extremely likely that the field, or one like it, exists, and explaining how the Higgs mechanism takes place in nature.\n\nThe mechanism was proposed in 1962 by [[Philip Warren Anderson]],<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite journal |author=Anderson, P.W. |title=Plasmons, gauge invariance, and mass |journal=Physical Review |volume=130 |year=1962 |issue=1 |pages=439\u201342 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.130.439 |bibcode=1963PhRv..130..439A }}</ref> following work in the late 1950s on symmetry breaking in [[superconductivity]] and a 1960 paper by [[Yoichiro Nambu]] that discussed its application within [[particle physics]].\n\nA theory able to finally explain [[mass generation]] without \"breaking\" gauge theory [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|was published almost simultaneously]] by three independent groups in 1964: by [[Robert Brout]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Englert]];<ref name=\"Englert\">{{cite journal |author1=Englert, F. |author2=Brout, R. | title=Broken symmetry and the mass of gauge vector mesons |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=13 |year=1964 |issue=9 |pages=321\u201323 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.321 |bibcode=1964PhRvL..13..321E}}</ref> by [[Peter Higgs]];<ref name=\"Higgs\">{{cite journal |first=Peter W. |last=Higgs |title=Broken symmetries and the masses of gauge bosons |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=13 |year=1964 |issue=16 |pages=508\u201309 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.508 |bibcode=1964PhRvL..13..508H}}</ref> and by [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[C.

Its electric charge is zero; its [[weak isospin]] is {{frac|1|2}}; its [[weak hypercharge]] (the charge for the '''U'''(1) gauge group) is 1. Under '''U'''(1) rotations, it is multiplied by a phase, which thus mixes the real and imaginary parts of the complex spinor into each other, combining to the standard two-component complex representation of the group '''U'''(2).\n\nThe Higgs field, through the interactions specified (summarized, represented, or even simulated) by its potential, induces spontaneous breaking of three out of the four generators (\"directions\") of the gauge group '''U'''(2). This is often written as '''SU'''(2) \u00d7 '''U'''(1), (which is strictly speaking only the same on the level of infinitesimal symmetries) because the diagonal phase factor also acts on other fields \u2013 [[quark]]s in particular. Three out of its four components would ordinarily resolve as [[Goldstone boson]]s, if they were not coupled to gauge fields.\n\nHowever, after symmetry breaking, these three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the three [[W and Z boson]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}}), and are only observable as components of these [[weak boson]]s, which are made massive by their inclusion; only the single remaining degree of freedom becomes a new scalar particle: the [[Higgs boson]].\n\n=== The photon as the part that remains massless ===\nThe gauge group of the electroweak part of the standard model is '''SU'''(2) \u00d7 '''U'''(1). The group '''SU'''(2) is the group of all 2-by-2 unitary matrices with unit determinant; all the orthonormal changes of coordinates in a complex two dimensional vector space.\n\nRotating the coordinates so that the second basis vector points in the direction of the Higgs boson makes the [[vacuum expectation value]] of ''H'' the spinor (0,&nbsp;''v''). The generators for rotations about the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes are by half the [[Pauli matrices]] ''\u03c3''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''\u03c3''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''\u03c3''<sub>''z''</sub>, so that a rotation of angle ''\u03b8'' about the ''z''-axis takes the vacuum to\n::<math> \\left(0, v e^{-\\frac{1}{2}i\\theta}\\right).</math>\n\nWhile the ''T''<sub>x</sub> and ''T''<sub>y</sub> generators mix up the top and bottom components of the [[spinor]], the ''T''<sub>z</sub> rotations only multiply each by opposite phases. This phase can be undone by a '''U'''(1) rotation of angle {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u03b8''. Consequently, under both an '''SU'''(2) ''T''<sub>z</sub>-rotation and a '''U'''(1) rotation by an amount {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u03b8'', ''the vacuum is invariant''.\n\nThis combination of generators\n::<math> Q = T_z + \\frac{1}{2}Y</math>\n\ndefines the unbroken part of the gauge group, where ''Q'' is the electric charge, ''T''<sub>z</sub> is the generator of rotations around the z-axis in the '''SU'''(2) and ''Y'' is the hypercharge generator of the '''U'''(1). This combination of generators (a ''z'' rotation in the '''SU'''(2) and a simultaneous '''U'''(1) rotation by half the angle) preserves the vacuum, and defines the unbroken gauge group in the standard model, namely ''the electric charge'' group. The part of the gauge field in this direction stays massless, and amounts to the physical photon.\n\n=== Consequences for fermions ===\nIn spite of the introduction of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the mass terms preclude chiral gauge invariance. For these fields, the mass terms should always be replaced by a gauge-invariant \"Higgs\" mechanism. One possibility is some kind of [[Yukawa coupling]] (see below) between the fermion field ''\u03c8'' and the Higgs field \u03a6, with unknown couplings ''G''<sub>''\u03c8''</sub>, which after symmetry breaking (more precisely: after expansion of the Lagrange density around a suitable ground state) again results in the original mass terms, which are now, however (i.e., by introduction of the Higgs field) written in a gauge-invariant way. The Lagrange density for the Yukawa interaction of a fermion field ''\u03c8'' and the Higgs field \u03a6 is\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{Fermion}}(\\phi, A, \\psi) = \\overline{\\psi} \\gamma^{\\mu} D_{\\mu} \\psi + G_{\\psi} \\overline{\\psi} \\phi \\psi,</math>\n\nwhere again the gauge field ''A'' only enters ''D''<sub>''\u03bc''</sub> (i.e., it is only indirectly visible). The quantities ''\u03b3''<sup>''\u03bc''</sup> are the [[Dirac matrices]], and ''G''<sub>''\u03c8''</sub> is the already-mentioned Yukawa coupling parameter. Now the mass-generation follows the same principle as above, namely from the existence of a finite expectation value <math>|\\langle\\phi\\rangle |</math>. Again, this is crucial for the existence of the property ''mass''.\n\n== History of research ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking]] offered a framework to introduce bosons into relativistic quantum field theories.

In the non-relativistic context this is a [[superconductor]], more formally known as the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|Landau model]] of a charged [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. In the relativistic condensate, the condensate is a scalar field that is relativistically invariant.\n\n=== Landau model ===\nThe Higgs mechanism is a type of [[superconductivity]] which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged, or, in field language, when a charged field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the quantum fluid filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does inside a superconductor; e.g., in the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory]]).\n\nA superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the [[Meissner effect]]. This was mysterious for a long time, because it implies that electromagnetic forces somehow become short-range inside the superconductor. Contrast this with the behavior of an ordinary metal. In a metal, the conductivity shields electric fields by rearranging charges on the surface until the total field cancels in the interior.\n\nBut magnetic fields can penetrate to any distance, and if a [[magnetic monopole]] (an isolated magnetic pole) is surrounded by a metal the field can escape without collimating into a string. In a superconductor, however, electric charges move with no dissipation, and this allows for permanent surface currents, not just surface charges. When magnetic fields are introduced at the boundary of a superconductor, they produce surface currents which exactly neutralize them.\n\nThe Meissner effect arises due to currents in a thin surface layer, whose [[London penetration depth|thickness can be calculated]] from the simple model of Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory, which treats superconductivity as a charged Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\n\nSuppose that a superconductor contains bosons with charge ''q''. The wavefunction of the bosons can be described by introducing a [[quantum field theory|quantum field]], ''\u03c8'', which obeys the [[Schr\u00f6dinger field|Schr\u00f6dinger equation as a field equation]]. In units where the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''\u0127'', is set to 1:\n\n:<math>i{\\partial \\over \\partial t} \\psi = {(\\nabla - iqA)^2 \\over 2m} \\psi.</math>\n\nThe operator ''\u03c8''(''x'') annihilates a boson at the point ''x'', while its adjoint ''\u03c8''{{sup|\u2020}} creates a new boson at the same point. The wavefunction of the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is then the [[expectation value]] ''\u03c8'' of ''\u03c8''(''x''), which is a classical function that obeys the same equation. The interpretation of the expectation value is that it is the phase that one should give to a newly created boson so that it will coherently superpose with all the other bosons already in the condensate.\n\nWhen there is a charged condensate, the electromagnetic interactions are screened. To see this, consider the effect of a [[gauge transformation]] on the field. A gauge transformation rotates the phase of the condensate by an amount which changes from point to point, and shifts the vector potential by a gradient:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\psi &\\rightarrow e^{iq\\phi(x)} \\psi \\\\\n    A &\\rightarrow A + \\nabla \\phi.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen there is no condensate, this transformation only changes the definition of the phase of ''\u03c8'' at every point. But when there is a condensate, the phase of the condensate defines a preferred choice of phase.\n\nThe condensate wave function can be written as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\rho(x)\\, e^{i\\theta(x)},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is real amplitude, which determines the local density of the condensate. If the condensate were neutral, the flow would be along the gradients of ''\u03b8'', the direction in which the phase of the Schr\u00f6dinger field changes. If the phase ''\u03b8'' changes slowly, the flow is slow and has very little energy. But now ''\u03b8'' can be made equal to zero just by making a gauge transformation to rotate the phase of the field.\n\nThe energy of slow changes of phase can be calculated from the Schr\u00f6dinger kinetic energy,\n\n:<math>H = {1 \\over 2m} \\left|(i q A + \\nabla)\\psi\\right|^2,</math>\n\nand taking the density of the condensate ''\u03c1'' to be constant,\n\n:<math>H \\approx {\\rho^2 \\over 2m} (q A + \\nabla \\theta)^2. </math>\n\nFixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, the electromagnetic field energy has an extra term,\n\n:<math>{q^2 \\rho^2 \\over 2m} A^2.</math>\n\nWhen this term is present, electromagnetic interactions become short-ranged. Every field mode, no matter how long the wavelength, oscillates with a nonzero frequency. The lowest frequency can be read off from the energy of a long wavelength ''A'' mode,\n\n:<math> E \\approx {{\\dot A}^2\\over 2} + {q^2 \\rho^2 \\over 2m} A^2. </math>\n\nThis is a harmonic oscillator with frequency\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} q^2 \\rho^2}.</math>\n\nThe quantity {{abs|''\u03c8''}}{{sup|2}} (= ''\u03c1''{{sup|2}}) is the density of the condensate of superconducting particles.\n\nIn an actual superconductor, the charged particles are electrons, which are fermions not bosons. So in order to have superconductivity, the electrons need to somehow bind into [[Cooper pair]]s. The charge of the condensate ''q'' is therefore twice the electron charge \u2212''e''. The pairing in a normal superconductor is due to lattice vibrations, and is in fact very weak; this means that the pairs are very loosely bound. The description of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of loosely bound pairs is actually more difficult than the description of a condensate of elementary particles, and was only worked out in 1957 by [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]] and [[John Robert Schrieffer]] in the famous [[BCS theory]].\n\n=== Abelian Higgs mechanism<!--'Higgs potential' redirects here--> ===\nGauge invariance means that certain transformations of the gauge field do not change the energy at all. If an arbitrary gradient is added to ''A'', the energy of the field is exactly the same. This makes it difficult to add a mass term, because a mass term tends to push the field toward the value zero. But the zero value of the vector potential is not a gauge invariant idea. What is zero in one gauge is nonzero in another.\n\nSo in order to give mass to a gauge theory, the gauge invariance must be broken by a condensate. The condensate will then define a preferred phase, and the phase of the condensate will define the zero value of the field in a gauge-invariant way. The gauge-invariant definition is that a gauge field is zero when the phase change along any path from parallel transport is equal to the phase difference in the condensate wavefunction.\n\nThe condensate value is described by a quantum field with an expectation value, just as in the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|Ginzburg\u2013Landau model]].\n\nIn order for the phase of the vacuum to define a gauge, the field must have a phase (also referred to as 'to be charged'). In order for a scalar field \u03a6 to have a phase, it must be complex, or (equivalently) it should contain two fields with a symmetry which rotates them into each other. The vector potential changes the phase of the quanta produced by the field when they move from point to point. In terms of fields, it defines how much to rotate the real and imaginary parts of the fields into each other when comparing field values at nearby points.\n\nThe only [[renormalization|renormalizable]] model where a complex scalar field \u03a6 acquires a nonzero value is the Mexican-hat model, where the field energy has a minimum away from zero. The action for this model is\n:<math>S(\\phi) = \\int \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\partial \\phi\\right|^2 - \\lambda \\left(\\left|\\phi\\right|^2 - \\Phi^2\\right)^2,</math>\nwhich results in the Hamiltonian\n:<math>H(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\dot\\phi\\right|^2 + \\left|\\nabla \\phi\\right|^2 + V(\\left|\\phi\\right|).</math>\nThe first term is the kinetic energy of the field. The second term is the extra potential energy when the field varies from point to point. The third term is the potential energy when the field has any given magnitude.\n\nThis potential energy, the '''Higgs potential'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, {{nowrap|''V''(''z'', \u03a6) = \u03bb(|''z''|{{sup|2}} \u2212 \u03a6{{sup|2}}){{sup|2}}}},<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldstone |first1=J. |doi=10.1007/BF02812722 |title=Field theories with \"superconductor\" solutions |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=154\u201364 |year=1961 |bibcode=1961NCim...19..154G |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/343400}}</ref> has a graph which looks like a [[Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat]], which gives the model its name. In particular, the minimum energy value is not at ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, but on the circle of points where the magnitude of ''z'' is \u03a6.\n\n[[Image:Mecanismo de Higgs PH.png|thumb|Higgs potential ''V''. For a fixed value of ''\u03bb'', the potential is presented upwards against the real and imaginary parts of \u03a6. The ''Mexican-hat'' or ''champagne-bottle profile'' at the ground should be noted.]]\n\nWhen the field \u03a6(''x'') is not coupled to electromagnetism, the Mexican-hat potential has flat directions. Starting in any one of the circle of vacua and changing the phase of the field from point to point costs very little energy. Mathematically, if\n:<math>\\phi(x) = \\Phi e^{i\\theta(x)}</math>\nwith a constant prefactor, then the action for the field ''\u03b8''(''x''), i.e., the \"phase\" of the Higgs field \u03a6(x), has only derivative terms. This is not a surprise. Adding a constant to ''\u03b8''(''x'') is a symmetry of the original theory, so different values of ''\u03b8''(''x'') cannot have different energies. This is an example of [[Goldstone's theorem]]: spontaneously broken continuous symmetries normally produce massless excitations.\n\nThe Abelian Higgs model is the Mexican-hat model coupled to [[Maxwell's theory|electromagnetism]]:\n:<math>S(\\phi, A) = \\int - \\frac{1}{4} F^{\\mu\\nu} F_{\\mu\\nu} + \\left|\\left(\\partial - i q A\\right)\\phi\\right|^2 - \\lambda \\left(\\left|\\phi\\right|^2 - \\Phi^2\\right)^2.</math>\n\nThe classical vacuum is again at the minimum of the potential, where the magnitude of the complex field ''\u03c6'' is equal to \u03a6. But now the phase of the field is arbitrary, because gauge transformations change it. This means that the field ''\u03b8''(''x'') can be set to zero by a gauge transformation, and does not represent any actual degrees of freedom at all.\n\nFurthermore, choosing a gauge where the phase of the vacuum is fixed, the potential energy for fluctuations of the vector field is nonzero. So in the Abelian Higgs model, the gauge field acquires a mass. To calculate the magnitude of the mass, consider a constant value of the vector potential ''A'' in the ''x''-direction in the gauge where the condensate has constant phase. This is the same as a sinusoidally varying condensate in the gauge where the vector potential is zero. In the gauge where A is zero, the potential energy density in the condensate is the scalar gradient energy:\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\partial \\left(\\Phi e^{i q A x} \\right) \\right|^2 = \\tfrac{1}{2} q^2 \\Phi^2 A^2.</math>\nThis energy is the same as a mass term {{sfrac|1|2}}''m''{{sup|2}}''A''{{sup|2}} where ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;\u03a6.\n\n=== Non-Abelian Higgs mechanism ===\nThe Non-Abelian Higgs model has the following action\n\n:<math>S(\\phi,\\mathbf A) = \\int {1 \\over 4g^2} \\mathop{\\textrm{tr}}(F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu \\nu}) + |D\\phi|^2 + V(|\\phi|)</math>\n\nwhere now the non-Abelian field '''A''' is contained in the covariant derivative ''D'' and in the tensor components <math>F^{\\mu \\nu}</math> and <math>F_{\\mu \\nu}</math> (the relation between '''A''' and those components is well-known from the [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]).\n\nIt is exactly analogous to the Abelian Higgs model. Now the field <math>\\phi</math> is in a representation of the gauge group, and the gauge covariant derivative is defined by the rate of change of the field minus the rate of change from parallel transport using the gauge field A as a connection.\n\n:<math>D\\phi = \\partial \\phi - i A^k t_k \\phi</math>\n\nAgain, the expectation value of <math>\\phi</math> defines a preferred gauge where the vacuum is constant, and fixing this gauge, fluctuations in the gauge field ''A'' come with a nonzero energy cost.\n\nDepending on the representation of the scalar field, not every gauge field acquires a mass. A simple example is in the renormalizable version of an early electroweak model due to [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this model, the gauge group is '''SO'''(3) (or '''SU'''(2) \u2212 there are no spinor representations in the model), and the gauge invariance is broken down to '''U'''(1) or '''SO'''(2) at long distances. To make a consistent renormalizable version using the Higgs mechanism, introduce a scalar field <math>\\phi^a</math> which transforms as a vector (a triplet) of '''SO'''(3). If this field has a vacuum expectation value, it points in some direction in field space. Without loss of generality, one can choose the ''z''-axis in field space to be the direction that <math>\\phi</math> is pointing, and then the vacuum expectation value of <math>\\phi</math> is {{nowrap|(0, 0, {{mvar|\u00c3}})}}, where {{mvar|\u00c3}} is a constant with dimensions of mass (<math>c = \\hbar = 1</math>).\n\nRotations around the ''z''-axis form a '''U'''(1) subgroup of '''SO'''(3) which preserves the vacuum expectation value of <math>\\phi</math>, and this is the unbroken gauge group. Rotations around the ''x'' and ''y''-axis do not preserve the vacuum, and the components of the '''SO'''(3) gauge field which generate these rotations become massive vector mesons. There are two massive W&nbsp;mesons in the Schwinger model, with a mass set by the mass scale {{mvar|\u00c3}}, and one massless '''U'''(1) gauge boson, similar to the photon.\n\nThe Schwinger model predicts [[magnetic monopole]]s at the electroweak unification scale, and does not predict the Z&nbsp;boson. It doesn't break electroweak symmetry properly as in nature. But historically, a model similar to this (but not using the Higgs mechanism) was the first in which the weak force and the electromagnetic force were unified.\n\n=== Affine Higgs mechanism ===\n[[Ernst Stueckelberg]] discovered<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stueckelberg, E.C.G. |year=1938 |title=Die Wechselwirkungskr\u00e4fte in der Elektrodynamik und in der Feldtheorie der Kr\u00e4fte |journal=Helv. Phys. Acta |volume=11 |page=225 |language=DE}}</ref> a version of the Higgs mechanism by analyzing the theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon. Effectively, [[Stueckelberg action|Stueckelberg's model]] is a limit of the regular Mexican hat Abelian Higgs model, where the vacuum expectation value ''H'' goes to infinity and the charge of the Higgs field goes to zero in such a way that their product stays fixed. The mass of the Higgs boson is proportional to ''H'', so the Higgs boson becomes infinitely massive and decouples, so is not present in the discussion. The vector meson mass, however, is equal to the product ''e&nbsp;H'', and stays finite.\n\nThe interpretation is that when a '''U'''(1) gauge field does not require quantized charges, it is possible to keep only the angular part of the Higgs oscillations, and discard the radial part. The angular part of the Higgs field ''\u03b8'' has the following gauge transformation law:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\theta &\\rightarrow \\theta + e\\alpha\\,\\\\\n       A &\\rightarrow A + \\partial \\alpha.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe gauge covariant derivative for the angle (which is actually gauge invariant) is:\n:<math> D\\theta = \\partial \\theta - e A H\\,</math>.\n\nIn order to keep ''\u03b8'' fluctuations finite and nonzero in this limit, ''\u03b8'' should be rescaled by H, so that its kinetic term in the action stays normalized. The action for the theta field is read off from the Mexican hat action by substituting <math>\\phi = H e^{i\\theta/H}</math>.\n\n:<math> S = \\int \\tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(D\\theta)^2 = \\int \\tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial \\theta - He A)^2 = \\int \\tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial \\theta - m A)^2</math>\n\nsince ''eH'' is the gauge boson mass. By making a gauge transformation to set {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8'' = 0}}, the gauge freedom in the action is eliminated, and the action becomes that of a massive vector field:\n\n:<math> S= \\int \\tfrac{1}{4} F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m^2 A^2.\\,</math>\n\nTo have arbitrarily small charges requires that the '''U'''(1) is not the circle of unit complex numbers under multiplication, but the real numbers '''R''' under addition, which is only different in the global topology. Such a '''U'''(1) group is non-compact. The field ''\u03b8'' transforms as an affine representation of the gauge group. Among the allowed gauge groups, only non-compact '''U'''(1) admits affine representations, and the '''U'''(1) of electromagnetism is experimentally known to be compact, since charge quantization holds to extremely high accuracy.\n\nThe Higgs condensate in this model has infinitesimal charge, so interactions with the Higgs boson do not violate charge conservation. The theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is still a renormalizable theory, one in which electric charge is still conserved, but [[magnetic monopole]]s are not allowed. For non-Abelian gauge theory, there is no affine limit, and the Higgs oscillations cannot be too much more massive than the vectors.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Electromagnetic mass]]\n* [[Higgs bundle]]\n* [[Quantum triviality]]\n* [[Yang\u2013Mills\u2013Higgs equations]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds a [[quantum field]] (the [[Higgs boson|Higgs field]]) that permeates all space to the Standard Model.

Its electric charge is zero; its [[weak isospin]] is {{frac|1|2}}; its [[weak hypercharge]] (the charge for the '''U'''(1) gauge group) is 1. Under '''U'''(1) rotations, it is multiplied by a phase, which thus mixes the real and imaginary parts of the complex spinor into each other, combining to the standard two-component complex representation of the group '''U'''(2).\n\nThe Higgs field, through the interactions specified (summarized, represented, or even simulated) by its potential, induces spontaneous breaking of three out of the four generators (\"directions\") of the gauge group '''U'''(2). This is often written as '''SU'''(2) \u00d7 '''U'''(1), (which is strictly speaking only the same on the level of infinitesimal symmetries) because the diagonal phase factor also acts on other fields \u2013 [[quark]]s in particular. Three out of its four components would ordinarily resolve as [[Goldstone boson]]s, if they were not coupled to gauge fields.\n\nHowever, after symmetry breaking, these three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the three [[W and Z boson]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}}), and are only observable as components of these [[weak boson]]s, which are made massive by their inclusion; only the single remaining degree of freedom becomes a new scalar particle: the [[Higgs boson]].\n\n=== The photon as the part that remains massless ===\nThe gauge group of the electroweak part of the standard model is '''SU'''(2) \u00d7 '''U'''(1). The group '''SU'''(2) is the group of all 2-by-2 unitary matrices with unit determinant; all the orthonormal changes of coordinates in a complex two dimensional vector space.\n\nRotating the coordinates so that the second basis vector points in the direction of the Higgs boson makes the [[vacuum expectation value]] of ''H'' the spinor (0,&nbsp;''v''). The generators for rotations about the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes are by half the [[Pauli matrices]] ''\u03c3''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''\u03c3''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''\u03c3''<sub>''z''</sub>, so that a rotation of angle ''\u03b8'' about the ''z''-axis takes the vacuum to\n::<math> \\left(0, v e^{-\\frac{1}{2}i\\theta}\\right).</math>\n\nWhile the ''T''<sub>x</sub> and ''T''<sub>y</sub> generators mix up the top and bottom components of the [[spinor]], the ''T''<sub>z</sub> rotations only multiply each by opposite phases. This phase can be undone by a '''U'''(1) rotation of angle {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u03b8''. Consequently, under both an '''SU'''(2) ''T''<sub>z</sub>-rotation and a '''U'''(1) rotation by an amount {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u03b8'', ''the vacuum is invariant''.\n\nThis combination of generators\n::<math> Q = T_z + \\frac{1}{2}Y</math>\n\ndefines the unbroken part of the gauge group, where ''Q'' is the electric charge, ''T''<sub>z</sub> is the generator of rotations around the z-axis in the '''SU'''(2) and ''Y'' is the hypercharge generator of the '''U'''(1). This combination of generators (a ''z'' rotation in the '''SU'''(2) and a simultaneous '''U'''(1) rotation by half the angle) preserves the vacuum, and defines the unbroken gauge group in the standard model, namely ''the electric charge'' group. The part of the gauge field in this direction stays massless, and amounts to the physical photon.\n\n=== Consequences for fermions ===\nIn spite of the introduction of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the mass terms preclude chiral gauge invariance. For these fields, the mass terms should always be replaced by a gauge-invariant \"Higgs\" mechanism. One possibility is some kind of [[Yukawa coupling]] (see below) between the fermion field ''\u03c8'' and the Higgs field \u03a6, with unknown couplings ''G''<sub>''\u03c8''</sub>, which after symmetry breaking (more precisely: after expansion of the Lagrange density around a suitable ground state) again results in the original mass terms, which are now, however (i.e., by introduction of the Higgs field) written in a gauge-invariant way. The Lagrange density for the Yukawa interaction of a fermion field ''\u03c8'' and the Higgs field \u03a6 is\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{Fermion}}(\\phi, A, \\psi) = \\overline{\\psi} \\gamma^{\\mu} D_{\\mu} \\psi + G_{\\psi} \\overline{\\psi} \\phi \\psi,</math>\n\nwhere again the gauge field ''A'' only enters ''D''<sub>''\u03bc''</sub> (i.e., it is only indirectly visible). The quantities ''\u03b3''<sup>''\u03bc''</sup> are the [[Dirac matrices]], and ''G''<sub>''\u03c8''</sub> is the already-mentioned Yukawa coupling parameter. Now the mass-generation follows the same principle as above, namely from the existence of a finite expectation value <math>|\\langle\\phi\\rangle |</math>. Again, this is crucial for the existence of the property ''mass''.\n\n== History of research ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking]] offered a framework to introduce bosons into relativistic quantum field theories.

In the non-relativistic context this is a [[superconductor]], more formally known as the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|Landau model]] of a charged [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. In the relativistic condensate, the condensate is a scalar field that is relativistically invariant.\n\n=== Landau model ===\nThe Higgs mechanism is a type of [[superconductivity]] which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged, or, in field language, when a charged field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the quantum fluid filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does inside a superconductor; e.g., in the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory]]).\n\nA superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the [[Meissner effect]]. This was mysterious for a long time, because it implies that electromagnetic forces somehow become short-range inside the superconductor. Contrast this with the behavior of an ordinary metal. In a metal, the conductivity shields electric fields by rearranging charges on the surface until the total field cancels in the interior.\n\nBut magnetic fields can penetrate to any distance, and if a [[magnetic monopole]] (an isolated magnetic pole) is surrounded by a metal the field can escape without collimating into a string. In a superconductor, however, electric charges move with no dissipation, and this allows for permanent surface currents, not just surface charges. When magnetic fields are introduced at the boundary of a superconductor, they produce surface currents which exactly neutralize them.\n\nThe Meissner effect arises due to currents in a thin surface layer, whose [[London penetration depth|thickness can be calculated]] from the simple model of Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory, which treats superconductivity as a charged Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\n\nSuppose that a superconductor contains bosons with charge ''q''. The wavefunction of the bosons can be described by introducing a [[quantum field theory|quantum field]], ''\u03c8'', which obeys the [[Schr\u00f6dinger field|Schr\u00f6dinger equation as a field equation]]. In units where the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''\u0127'', is set to 1:\n\n:<math>i{\\partial \\over \\partial t} \\psi = {(\\nabla - iqA)^2 \\over 2m} \\psi.</math>\n\nThe operator ''\u03c8''(''x'') annihilates a boson at the point ''x'', while its adjoint ''\u03c8''{{sup|\u2020}} creates a new boson at the same point. The wavefunction of the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is then the [[expectation value]] ''\u03c8'' of ''\u03c8''(''x''), which is a classical function that obeys the same equation. The interpretation of the expectation value is that it is the phase that one should give to a newly created boson so that it will coherently superpose with all the other bosons already in the condensate.\n\nWhen there is a charged condensate, the electromagnetic interactions are screened. To see this, consider the effect of a [[gauge transformation]] on the field. A gauge transformation rotates the phase of the condensate by an amount which changes from point to point, and shifts the vector potential by a gradient:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\psi &\\rightarrow e^{iq\\phi(x)} \\psi \\\\\n    A &\\rightarrow A + \\nabla \\phi.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen there is no condensate, this transformation only changes the definition of the phase of ''\u03c8'' at every point. But when there is a condensate, the phase of the condensate defines a preferred choice of phase.\n\nThe condensate wave function can be written as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\rho(x)\\, e^{i\\theta(x)},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is real amplitude, which determines the local density of the condensate. If the condensate were neutral, the flow would be along the gradients of ''\u03b8'', the direction in which the phase of the Schr\u00f6dinger field changes. If the phase ''\u03b8'' changes slowly, the flow is slow and has very little energy. But now ''\u03b8'' can be made equal to zero just by making a gauge transformation to rotate the phase of the field.\n\nThe energy of slow changes of phase can be calculated from the Schr\u00f6dinger kinetic energy,\n\n:<math>H = {1 \\over 2m} \\left|(i q A + \\nabla)\\psi\\right|^2,</math>\n\nand taking the density of the condensate ''\u03c1'' to be constant,\n\n:<math>H \\approx {\\rho^2 \\over 2m} (q A + \\nabla \\theta)^2. </math>\n\nFixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, the electromagnetic field energy has an extra term,\n\n:<math>{q^2 \\rho^2 \\over 2m} A^2.</math>\n\nWhen this term is present, electromagnetic interactions become short-ranged. Every field mode, no matter how long the wavelength, oscillates with a nonzero frequency. The lowest frequency can be read off from the energy of a long wavelength ''A'' mode,\n\n:<math> E \\approx {{\\dot A}^2\\over 2} + {q^2 \\rho^2 \\over 2m} A^2. </math>\n\nThis is a harmonic oscillator with frequency\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} q^2 \\rho^2}.</math>\n\nThe quantity {{abs|''\u03c8''}}{{sup|2}} (= ''\u03c1''{{sup|2}}) is the density of the condensate of superconducting particles.\n\nIn an actual superconductor, the charged particles are electrons, which are fermions not bosons. So in order to have superconductivity, the electrons need to somehow bind into [[Cooper pair]]s. The charge of the condensate ''q'' is therefore twice the electron charge \u2212''e''. The pairing in a normal superconductor is due to lattice vibrations, and is in fact very weak; this means that the pairs are very loosely bound. The description of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of loosely bound pairs is actually more difficult than the description of a condensate of elementary particles, and was only worked out in 1957 by [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]] and [[John Robert Schrieffer]] in the famous [[BCS theory]].\n\n=== Abelian Higgs mechanism<!--'Higgs potential' redirects here--> ===\nGauge invariance means that certain transformations of the gauge field do not change the energy at all. If an arbitrary gradient is added to ''A'', the energy of the field is exactly the same. This makes it difficult to add a mass term, because a mass term tends to push the field toward the value zero. But the zero value of the vector potential is not a gauge invariant idea. What is zero in one gauge is nonzero in another.\n\nSo in order to give mass to a gauge theory, the gauge invariance must be broken by a condensate. The condensate will then define a preferred phase, and the phase of the condensate will define the zero value of the field in a gauge-invariant way. The gauge-invariant definition is that a gauge field is zero when the phase change along any path from parallel transport is equal to the phase difference in the condensate wavefunction.\n\nThe condensate value is described by a quantum field with an expectation value, just as in the [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|Ginzburg\u2013Landau model]].\n\nIn order for the phase of the vacuum to define a gauge, the field must have a phase (also referred to as 'to be charged'). In order for a scalar field \u03a6 to have a phase, it must be complex, or (equivalently) it should contain two fields with a symmetry which rotates them into each other. The vector potential changes the phase of the quanta produced by the field when they move from point to point. In terms of fields, it defines how much to rotate the real and imaginary parts of the fields into each other when comparing field values at nearby points.\n\nThe only [[renormalization|renormalizable]] model where a complex scalar field \u03a6 acquires a nonzero value is the Mexican-hat model, where the field energy has a minimum away from zero. The action for this model is\n:<math>S(\\phi) = \\int \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\partial \\phi\\right|^2 - \\lambda \\left(\\left|\\phi\\right|^2 - \\Phi^2\\right)^2,</math>\nwhich results in the Hamiltonian\n:<math>H(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\dot\\phi\\right|^2 + \\left|\\nabla \\phi\\right|^2 + V(\\left|\\phi\\right|).</math>\nThe first term is the kinetic energy of the field. The second term is the extra potential energy when the field varies from point to point. The third term is the potential energy when the field has any given magnitude.\n\nThis potential energy, the '''Higgs potential'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, {{nowrap|''V''(''z'', \u03a6) = \u03bb(|''z''|{{sup|2}} \u2212 \u03a6{{sup|2}}){{sup|2}}}},<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldstone |first1=J. |doi=10.1007/BF02812722 |title=Field theories with \"superconductor\" solutions |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=154\u201364 |year=1961 |bibcode=1961NCim...19..154G |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/343400}}</ref> has a graph which looks like a [[Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat]], which gives the model its name.

For a fixed value of ''\u03bb'', the potential is presented upwards against the real and imaginary parts of \u03a6. The ''Mexican-hat'' or ''champagne-bottle profile'' at the ground should be noted.]]\n\nWhen the field \u03a6(''x'') is not coupled to electromagnetism, the Mexican-hat potential has flat directions. Starting in any one of the circle of vacua and changing the phase of the field from point to point costs very little energy. Mathematically, if\n:<math>\\phi(x) = \\Phi e^{i\\theta(x)}</math>\nwith a constant prefactor, then the action for the field ''\u03b8''(''x''), i.e., the \"phase\" of the Higgs field \u03a6(x), has only derivative terms. This is not a surprise. Adding a constant to ''\u03b8''(''x'') is a symmetry of the original theory, so different values of ''\u03b8''(''x'') cannot have different energies. This is an example of [[Goldstone's theorem]]: spontaneously broken continuous symmetries normally produce massless excitations.\n\nThe Abelian Higgs model is the Mexican-hat model coupled to [[Maxwell's theory|electromagnetism]]:\n:<math>S(\\phi, A) = \\int - \\frac{1}{4} F^{\\mu\\nu} F_{\\mu\\nu} + \\left|\\left(\\partial - i q A\\right)\\phi\\right|^2 - \\lambda \\left(\\left|\\phi\\right|^2 - \\Phi^2\\right)^2.</math>\n\nThe classical vacuum is again at the minimum of the potential, where the magnitude of the complex field ''\u03c6'' is equal to \u03a6. But now the phase of the field is arbitrary, because gauge transformations change it. This means that the field ''\u03b8''(''x'') can be set to zero by a gauge transformation, and does not represent any actual degrees of freedom at all.\n\nFurthermore, choosing a gauge where the phase of the vacuum is fixed, the potential energy for fluctuations of the vector field is nonzero. So in the Abelian Higgs model, the gauge field acquires a mass. To calculate the magnitude of the mass, consider a constant value of the vector potential ''A'' in the ''x''-direction in the gauge where the condensate has constant phase. This is the same as a sinusoidally varying condensate in the gauge where the vector potential is zero. In the gauge where A is zero, the potential energy density in the condensate is the scalar gradient energy:\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\partial \\left(\\Phi e^{i q A x} \\right) \\right|^2 = \\tfrac{1}{2} q^2 \\Phi^2 A^2.</math>\nThis energy is the same as a mass term {{sfrac|1|2}}''m''{{sup|2}}''A''{{sup|2}} where ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;\u03a6.\n\n=== Non-Abelian Higgs mechanism ===\nThe Non-Abelian Higgs model has the following action\n\n:<math>S(\\phi,\\mathbf A) = \\int {1 \\over 4g^2} \\mathop{\\textrm{tr}}(F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu \\nu}) + |D\\phi|^2 + V(|\\phi|)</math>\n\nwhere now the non-Abelian field '''A''' is contained in the covariant derivative ''D'' and in the tensor components <math>F^{\\mu \\nu}</math> and <math>F_{\\mu \\nu}</math> (the relation between '''A''' and those components is well-known from the [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]).\n\nIt is exactly analogous to the Abelian Higgs model. Now the field <math>\\phi</math> is in a representation of the gauge group, and the gauge covariant derivative is defined by the rate of change of the field minus the rate of change from parallel transport using the gauge field A as a connection.\n\n:<math>D\\phi = \\partial \\phi - i A^k t_k \\phi</math>\n\nAgain, the expectation value of <math>\\phi</math> defines a preferred gauge where the vacuum is constant, and fixing this gauge, fluctuations in the gauge field ''A'' come with a nonzero energy cost.\n\nDepending on the representation of the scalar field, not every gauge field acquires a mass. A simple example is in the renormalizable version of an early electroweak model due to [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this model, the gauge group is '''SO'''(3) (or '''SU'''(2) \u2212 there are no spinor representations in the model), and the gauge invariance is broken down to '''U'''(1) or '''SO'''(2) at long distances. To make a consistent renormalizable version using the Higgs mechanism, introduce a scalar field <math>\\phi^a</math> which transforms as a vector (a triplet) of '''SO'''(3). If this field has a vacuum expectation value, it points in some direction in field space. Without loss of generality, one can choose the ''z''-axis in field space to be the direction that <math>\\phi</math> is pointing, and then the vacuum expectation value of <math>\\phi</math> is {{nowrap|(0, 0, {{mvar|\u00c3}})}}, where {{mvar|\u00c3}} is a constant with dimensions of mass (<math>c = \\hbar = 1</math>).\n\nRotations around the ''z''-axis form a '''U'''(1) subgroup of '''SO'''(3) which preserves the vacuum expectation value of <math>\\phi</math>, and this is the unbroken gauge group. Rotations around the ''x'' and ''y''-axis do not preserve the vacuum, and the components of the '''SO'''(3) gauge field which generate these rotations become massive vector mesons. There are two massive W&nbsp;mesons in the Schwinger model, with a mass set by the mass scale {{mvar|\u00c3}}, and one massless '''U'''(1) gauge boson, similar to the photon.\n\nThe Schwinger model predicts [[magnetic monopole]]s at the electroweak unification scale, and does not predict the Z&nbsp;boson. It doesn't break electroweak symmetry properly as in nature. But historically, a model similar to this (but not using the Higgs mechanism) was the first in which the weak force and the electromagnetic force were unified.\n\n=== Affine Higgs mechanism ===\n[[Ernst Stueckelberg]] discovered<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stueckelberg, E.C.G. |year=1938 |title=Die Wechselwirkungskr\u00e4fte in der Elektrodynamik und in der Feldtheorie der Kr\u00e4fte |journal=Helv. Phys. Acta |volume=11 |page=225 |language=DE}}</ref> a version of the Higgs mechanism by analyzing the theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon. Effectively, [[Stueckelberg action|Stueckelberg's model]] is a limit of the regular Mexican hat Abelian Higgs model, where the vacuum expectation value ''H'' goes to infinity and the charge of the Higgs field goes to zero in such a way that their product stays fixed. The mass of the Higgs boson is proportional to ''H'', so the Higgs boson becomes infinitely massive and decouples, so is not present in the discussion. The vector meson mass, however, is equal to the product ''e&nbsp;H'', and stays finite.\n\nThe interpretation is that when a '''U'''(1) gauge field does not require quantized charges, it is possible to keep only the angular part of the Higgs oscillations, and discard the radial part. The angular part of the Higgs field ''\u03b8'' has the following gauge transformation law:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\theta &\\rightarrow \\theta + e\\alpha\\,\\\\\n       A &\\rightarrow A + \\partial \\alpha.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe gauge covariant derivative for the angle (which is actually gauge invariant) is:\n:<math> D\\theta = \\partial \\theta - e A H\\,</math>.\n\nIn order to keep ''\u03b8'' fluctuations finite and nonzero in this limit, ''\u03b8'' should be rescaled by H, so that its kinetic term in the action stays normalized. The action for the theta field is read off from the Mexican hat action by substituting <math>\\phi = H e^{i\\theta/H}</math>.\n\n:<math> S = \\int \\tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(D\\theta)^2 = \\int \\tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial \\theta - He A)^2 = \\int \\tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial \\theta - m A)^2</math>\n\nsince ''eH'' is the gauge boson mass. By making a gauge transformation to set {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8'' = 0}}, the gauge freedom in the action is eliminated, and the action becomes that of a massive vector field:\n\n:<math> S= \\int \\tfrac{1}{4} F^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m^2 A^2.\\,</math>\n\nTo have arbitrarily small charges requires that the '''U'''(1) is not the circle of unit complex numbers under multiplication, but the real numbers '''R''' under addition, which is only different in the global topology. Such a '''U'''(1) group is non-compact. The field ''\u03b8'' transforms as an affine representation of the gauge group. Among the allowed gauge groups, only non-compact '''U'''(1) admits affine representations, and the '''U'''(1) of electromagnetism is experimentally known to be compact, since charge quantization holds to extremely high accuracy.\n\nThe Higgs condensate in this model has infinitesimal charge, so interactions with the Higgs boson do not violate charge conservation. The theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is still a renormalizable theory, one in which electric charge is still conserved, but [[magnetic monopole]]s are not allowed. For non-Abelian gauge theory, there is no affine limit, and the Higgs oscillations cannot be too much more massive than the vectors.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Electromagnetic mass]]\n* [[Higgs bundle]]\n* [[Quantum triviality]]\n* [[Yang\u2013Mills\u2013Higgs equations]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.
