Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September.

This system is applicable if the [[propagule]] (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted into the same field.  Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free, or a [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] vegetable, such as cabbage or spinach, is planted. Alternatively, the vegetable can also be planted after the [[harvest]] of lotus.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother alternative way is to not harvest the lotus [[rhizome]], although it is ripe. A terricolous vegetable is planted between the rhizomes into the [[Drainage|drained field]].

Furthermore, this group grows the tallest and produces very few to no flowers.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n[[Cultivar]]s can be classified by harvest time or by the depth of rhizomes into these types:\n* Pre-mature (early) cultivars are harvested before the end of July, serotinous (late) cultivars from September on and mid-serotinous or mid-matutinal cultivars are in between these harvest times. Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September. Rhizomes of adlittoral cultivars are crisp and good for [[frying]] purposes. Deep cultivars grow more than {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} deep. They are often serotinous and can harvest high yield. Their rhizomes are [[starch]]-rich.<ref name=\":6\" />\nThe main popular ''Nelumbo nucifera'' cultivars in China are Elian 1, Elian 4, Elian 5, 9217, Xin 1 and 00\u201301. Average yield of these cultivars is 7.5\u201315 t/ha (3.3-6.7 tons/acre) of harvest in July and 30\u201345 t/ha (13-20 tons/acre) of harvest in September.<ref name=\":6\" /> In Australia, the cultivar grown for the fresh rhizome market is Quangdong and in Japan the common rhizome cultivars are Tenno and Bitchu.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==== Seed lotus ====\n[[File:Nelumbo nucifera5.jpg|200px|thumb|''Nelumbo nucifera'' seed head]]\nThe characteristics of seed lotus cultivars are a large number of [[Gynoecium|carpels]] and seed sets as well as large seeds with better nutritional properties. Roots of these varieties are thin, fibrous and do not form good rhizomes.<ref name=\":11\" /> The main popular cultivars for seed production in China are Cunsanlian, Xianglian 1, Zilian 2, Jianlian, Ganlian 62 and Taikong 36. Average yield of these cultivars in China is 1.05\u20131.9 t/ha (0.5\u20130.8 tons/acre) of dry seeds and weight of thousand seeds between {{convert|1020|to|1800|g|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\":6\" /> Green Jade and Vietnam-Red are recommended cultivars for seed production in [[Australia]].<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==== Flower lotus ====\nFlower lotus cultivars are used exclusively for [[Ornamental plant|ornamental purpose]], produce a large number of flowers and the lowest plant height.\n\n<ref name=\":6\" /> Seed production of flower lotus is poor regarding yield and quality. Flower types differ in the number of [[petal]]s (single petals, double petals or multi-petals) and their colours range from single colour in white, yellow, pink, red to bi-colour, most often of white petals with pink tip or highlights.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Farming ===\nAbout 70% of lotus for the human consumption is produced in China. In 2005, the cultivation area in China was estimated at {{convert|300000|ha}}.<ref name=\":5\" /> A majority of lotus production takes place in managed farming systems in ponds or flooded fields like [[rice]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe most widely used system is [[crop rotation]] with rice and [[vegetable]]s. This system is applicable if the [[propagule]] (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted into the same field.  Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free, or a [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] vegetable, such as cabbage or spinach, is planted. Alternatively, the vegetable can also be planted after the [[harvest]] of lotus.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother alternative way is to not harvest the lotus [[rhizome]], although it is ripe. A terricolous vegetable is planted between the rhizomes into the [[Drainage|drained field]]. The rhizomes are then harvested next March.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA third way is to plant lotus in ponds or fields and raise aquatic animals such as [[fish]], [[shrimp]] or [[crab]] in the same field.<ref name=\":6\" /> A more efficient use of the water for both, the [[aquatic animal]] and the lotus production, has been identified with this planting pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Assessing lotus for wastewater bioremediation|date=2009|publisher=Rural Industries Research and Development Corp|others=Seymour, Evizel., Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (Australia)|isbn=978-1741518887|location=Canberra|oclc=682913738}}</ref>\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Lotus Nelumbo nucifera Water Drops 2654px.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Lotus effect]] on ''nelumbo nucifera'' hybrid]]\n\n=== Human consumption ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Rhizomes ====\n[[File:Lotus root.jpg|thumb|Lotus [[rhizomes]]]]\n[[File:JaRenkonLotus11R.jpg|thumb|Boiled, sliced lotus roots used in various Asian cuisines]]\n\nThe rhizomes of lotus are consumed as a vegetable in Asian countries, extensively in China and Japan: sold whole or in cut pieces, fresh, frozen, or canned.
