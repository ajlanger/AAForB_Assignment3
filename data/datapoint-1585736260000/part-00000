Colchester is generally regarded as having an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') like the rest of the United Kingdom. Its easterly position within the British Isles makes Colchester less prone to Atlantic depressions and weather fronts but more prone to droughts. This is because, like most areas in southeast England, Colchester's weather is influenced more by Continental weather patterns than by Atlantic weather systems. This leads to a dry climate compared to the rest of the UK all year round and occasional (relative) extremes of temperatures during the year (occasional high 20\u00b0Cs/low 30\u00b0Cs during the summer) and quite a few nights below freezing during the winter months (daytime high temperatures are seldom below freezing). Any rainfall that does come from Atlantic weather systems is usually light, but a few heavy showers and [[thunderstorm]]s can take place during the summer. Snow falls on average 13 days a year during winter and early spring.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in Colchester was {{convert|36.1|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2003 (during the [[2003 European heat wave]]), and the lowest was {{convert|-9.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in December 2010.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colchester\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 7\n|Feb high C = 7.7\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.2\n|May high C = 18\n|Jun high C = 20.6\n|Jul high C = 23.4\n|Aug high C = 23.3\n|Sep high C = 19.9\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 10.3\n|Dec high C = 7.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 7.1\n|Apr mean C = 10.9\n|May mean C = 12.8\n|Jun mean C = 15.6\n|Jul mean C = 18.3\n|Aug mean C = 18.1\n|Sep mean C = 15.4\n|Oct mean C = 11.5\n|Nov mean C = 7.5\n|Dec mean C = 5\n|Year mean C =\n|Jan low C = 2\n|Feb low C = 1.7\n|Mar low C = 3.3\n|Apr low C = 4.7\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 13.2\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 10.9\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 4.8\n|Dec low C = 2.7\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 53\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44\n|Mar precipitation mm = 44\n|Apr precipitation mm = 44\n|May precipitation mm = 52\n|Jun precipitation mm = 54\n|Jul precipitation mm = 48\n|Aug precipitation mm = 57\n|Sep precipitation mm = 52\n|Oct precipitation mm = 70\n|Nov precipitation mm = 62\n|Dec precipitation mm = 57\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = 1981\u20132010 estimated average (records began in 1988) for COL station Colchester NE 2\n}}\n\n==Garrison {{anchor|MCTC}}==\n{{Main|Colchester Garrison}}\n\n[[File:MCTC Colchester - geograph.org.uk - 63934.jpg|thumb|right|The military corrective training centre]]Colchester has been an important military garrison since the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] era.

Two of the town's secondary schools are selective, [[Colchester Royal Grammar School]] and [[Colchester County High School]], the remainder being comprehensives. Comprehensive secondary schools include [[Gilberd School]], [[Colchester Academy]], [[Philip Morant School and College]], [[St Helena School, Essex|St Helena Media Arts College]], [[St Benedict's Catholic College]], [[Thomas Lord Audley School]] and the Paxman Academy.\n\n===Tertiary===\nThe [[University of Essex]] is located to the east of Colchester in Wivenhoe Park, in the civil parish of [[Wivenhoe]]. Other tertiary institutions include [[Colchester Sixth Form College]] and [[Colchester Institute]].\n\n====Private schools====\nPrivate schools in Colchester include [[St. Mary's Colchester|St. Mary's School]], and [[Colchester High School]].\n\n==Transport==\nColchester has a bus system (run mostly by [[First Essex]] and [[Arriva Colchester]], as well as [[Hedingham Omnibuses]], Beeston's, [[Ipswich Buses]], Panther Travel (Essex) and [[Chambers (bus company)|Chambers]]) which mostly uses the bus station in Osborne Street on the southern edge of the town centre.\n\n[[Colchester railway station]] is located on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The town is also served by [[Colchester Town railway station]] and [[Hythe (Essex) railway station|Hythe station]] located on the [[Sunshine Coast Line]].\n\nColchester is linked to London by the [[A12 road (England)|A12]].\n\n==References in literature==\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]] mentions Colchester (Camulodunum) in ''The Annals of Imperial Rome''. In Book XIV he describes how '...the Roman ex-soldiers...had recently established a settlement at Camulodunum', later burned down in the Iceni rebellion.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV, 31</ref>\n\nIt is the only town in Britain to have been explicitly mentioned in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as being the target of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]. The (fictional) Atomic Wars took place during the 1950s. Colchester is the only town that was specifically mentioned as being bombed, but the book does say that many cities were destroyed in North America, Europe, and Russia.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date=February 2019}} \nColchester is reputed to be the home of three of the best known English nursery rhymes: '[[Old King Cole]]', '[[Humpty Dumpty]]' and 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star', although the legitimacy of all three claims is disputed.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nLocal legend places Colchester as the seat of [[King Cole]] (or Coel) of the rhyme ''Old King Cole'', a legendary ancient king of Britain. The name Colchester is from [[Latin]]: the place-name suffixes ''chester'', ''cester'', and ''caster'' derive from the Latin word ''[[castrum]]'' (fortified place). In folk etymology the name Colchester was thought of as meaning Cole's Castle {{who|date=August 2017}}, though this theory does not have academic support. In the legend Helena, the daughter of Cole, married the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[senator]] [[Constantius Chlorus]], who had been sent by Rome as an ambassador and was named as Cole's successor. Helena's son became Emperor [[Constantine I]]. Helena was canonised as [[Saint]] [[Helena of Constantinople]] and is credited with finding the [[true cross]] and the remains of [[biblical magi|the Magi]]. She is now the patron saint of Colchester. This is recognised in the emblem of Colchester: a cross and three crowns. The Mayor's medallion contains a Byzantine style icon of Saint Helena. A local secondary school&nbsp;\u2013 St Helena's&nbsp;\u2013 is named after her, and her statue is atop the town hall, although local legend is that it was originally a statue of Blessed Virgin Mary which was later fitted with a cross.\n\nColchester is a widely credited source{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} of the rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]]. During the siege of Colchester in the Civil War, a Royalist sniper known as One-Eyed Thompson sat in the belfry of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls (''Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall'') and was given the nickname Humpty Dumpty, most likely because of his size, ''Humpty Dumpty'' being a common insult for the overweight. Thompson was shot down (''Humpty Dumpty had a great fall'') and, shortly after, the town was lost to the Parliamentarians (''all the king's horses and all the king's men / couldn't put Humpty together again.'') Another version says that Humpty Dumpty was a cannon on the top of the church. The church of St Mary-at-the-Walls still retains its Norman tower until the top few feet, which are a Georgian repair.\n\nThe third rhyme said to have come from Colchester is [[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]], which was written by [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]]  who lived in the town's Dutch Quarter, and published in 1806 with the title \"The Star\".\n\nColchester has also been suggested as one of the potential sites of [[Camelot]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Nash Ford|first=David|title=Early British Kingdoms: Colchester|url=http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211112608/http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|archivedate=11 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> on account of having been the capital of Roman Britain and its ancient name of ''Camulodunum'': this is not considered likely by academics, as in Arthurian times Colchester was under Saxon control.\n\nThe first part of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' was set in Colchester.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nColchester was also a named line of [[lathe]] machinery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |title=As detailed here |publisher=Lathes.co.uk |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102004031/http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe opening credits for the British TV comedy show [[Blackadder Goes Forth]] and a scene from the film [[Monty Python and the Meaning of Life]] were both filmed at [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester's former cavalry barracks]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] Colchester was the scene of a nuclear detonation.\n\nThe ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes ''[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]'' are set in Colchester, although they were filmed in [[Cardiff]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Wales |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |title=IGN review |publisher=ign.com |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617223502/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |archivedate=17 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Asterix]] comic book ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'' the [[Camulodunum]] rugby team wins a game against [[Durovernum]] (Roman name for [[Canterbury]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goscinny|first1=Ren\u00e9|last2=Underzo|first2=Albert|title=Asterix in Britain|series=Asterix #3|year=1973|publisher=Hodder Dargaud|isbn=0-340-17221-5|page=38}}</ref> The uniforms worn during the match in the book are similar to the modern kit of [[Colchester United]].\n\nProminent members of [[Blur (band)|Blur]], a popular 1990s music group met at school in Colchester.<ref>{{cite news|title=Colchester: how a shared 'fly pie' may bring Britpop band Blur back to Colchester|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|newspaper=Daily Gazette|date=22 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512110935/http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Princesses on Parade\" sequence in the 1994 film ''[[The Swan Princess]]'', one of the princesses in the beauty pageant is said to come from Colchester.

Colchester is generally regarded as having an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') like the rest of the United Kingdom. Its easterly position within the British Isles makes Colchester less prone to Atlantic depressions and weather fronts but more prone to droughts. This is because, like most areas in southeast England, Colchester's weather is influenced more by Continental weather patterns than by Atlantic weather systems. This leads to a dry climate compared to the rest of the UK all year round and occasional (relative) extremes of temperatures during the year (occasional high 20\u00b0Cs/low 30\u00b0Cs during the summer) and quite a few nights below freezing during the winter months (daytime high temperatures are seldom below freezing). Any rainfall that does come from Atlantic weather systems is usually light, but a few heavy showers and [[thunderstorm]]s can take place during the summer. Snow falls on average 13 days a year during winter and early spring.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in Colchester was {{convert|36.1|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2003 (during the [[2003 European heat wave]]), and the lowest was {{convert|-9.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in December 2010.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colchester\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 7\n|Feb high C = 7.7\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.2\n|May high C = 18\n|Jun high C = 20.6\n|Jul high C = 23.4\n|Aug high C = 23.3\n|Sep high C = 19.9\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 10.3\n|Dec high C = 7.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 7.1\n|Apr mean C = 10.9\n|May mean C = 12.8\n|Jun mean C = 15.6\n|Jul mean C = 18.3\n|Aug mean C = 18.1\n|Sep mean C = 15.4\n|Oct mean C = 11.5\n|Nov mean C = 7.5\n|Dec mean C = 5\n|Year mean C =\n|Jan low C = 2\n|Feb low C = 1.7\n|Mar low C = 3.3\n|Apr low C = 4.7\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 13.2\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 10.9\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 4.8\n|Dec low C = 2.7\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 53\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44\n|Mar precipitation mm = 44\n|Apr precipitation mm = 44\n|May precipitation mm = 52\n|Jun precipitation mm = 54\n|Jul precipitation mm = 48\n|Aug precipitation mm = 57\n|Sep precipitation mm = 52\n|Oct precipitation mm = 70\n|Nov precipitation mm = 62\n|Dec precipitation mm = 57\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = 1981\u20132010 estimated average (records began in 1988) for COL station Colchester NE 2\n}}\n\n==Garrison {{anchor|MCTC}}==\n{{Main|Colchester Garrison}}\n\n[[File:MCTC Colchester - geograph.org.uk - 63934.jpg|thumb|right|The military corrective training centre]]Colchester has been an important military garrison since the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] era.

Two of the town's secondary schools are selective, [[Colchester Royal Grammar School]] and [[Colchester County High School]], the remainder being comprehensives. Comprehensive secondary schools include [[Gilberd School]], [[Colchester Academy]], [[Philip Morant School and College]], [[St Helena School, Essex|St Helena Media Arts College]], [[St Benedict's Catholic College]], [[Thomas Lord Audley School]] and the Paxman Academy.\n\n===Tertiary===\nThe [[University of Essex]] is located to the east of Colchester in Wivenhoe Park, in the civil parish of [[Wivenhoe]]. Other tertiary institutions include [[Colchester Sixth Form College]] and [[Colchester Institute]].\n\n====Private schools====\nPrivate schools in Colchester include [[St. Mary's Colchester|St. Mary's School]], and [[Colchester High School]].\n\n==Transport==\nColchester has a bus system (run mostly by [[First Essex]] and [[Arriva Colchester]], as well as [[Hedingham Omnibuses]], Beeston's, [[Ipswich Buses]], Panther Travel (Essex) and [[Chambers (bus company)|Chambers]]) which mostly uses the bus station in Osborne Street on the southern edge of the town centre.\n\n[[Colchester railway station]] is located on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The town is also served by [[Colchester Town railway station]] and [[Hythe (Essex) railway station|Hythe station]] located on the [[Sunshine Coast Line]].\n\nColchester is linked to London by the [[A12 road (England)|A12]].\n\n==References in literature==\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]] mentions Colchester (Camulodunum) in ''The Annals of Imperial Rome''. In Book XIV he describes how '...the Roman ex-soldiers...had recently established a settlement at Camulodunum', later burned down in the Iceni rebellion.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV, 31</ref>\n\nIt is the only town in Britain to have been explicitly mentioned in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as being the target of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]. The (fictional) Atomic Wars took place during the 1950s. Colchester is the only town that was specifically mentioned as being bombed, but the book does say that many cities were destroyed in North America, Europe, and Russia.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date=February 2019}} \nColchester is reputed to be the home of three of the best known English nursery rhymes: '[[Old King Cole]]', '[[Humpty Dumpty]]' and 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star', although the legitimacy of all three claims is disputed.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nLocal legend places Colchester as the seat of [[King Cole]] (or Coel) of the rhyme ''Old King Cole'', a legendary ancient king of Britain. The name Colchester is from [[Latin]]: the place-name suffixes ''chester'', ''cester'', and ''caster'' derive from the Latin word ''[[castrum]]'' (fortified place). In folk etymology the name Colchester was thought of as meaning Cole's Castle {{who|date=August 2017}}, though this theory does not have academic support. In the legend Helena, the daughter of Cole, married the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[senator]] [[Constantius Chlorus]], who had been sent by Rome as an ambassador and was named as Cole's successor. Helena's son became Emperor [[Constantine I]]. Helena was canonised as [[Saint]] [[Helena of Constantinople]] and is credited with finding the [[true cross]] and the remains of [[biblical magi|the Magi]]. She is now the patron saint of Colchester. This is recognised in the emblem of Colchester: a cross and three crowns. The Mayor's medallion contains a Byzantine style icon of Saint Helena. A local secondary school&nbsp;\u2013 St Helena's&nbsp;\u2013 is named after her, and her statue is atop the town hall, although local legend is that it was originally a statue of Blessed Virgin Mary which was later fitted with a cross.\n\nColchester is a widely credited source{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} of the rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]]. During the siege of Colchester in the Civil War, a Royalist sniper known as One-Eyed Thompson sat in the belfry of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls (''Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall'') and was given the nickname Humpty Dumpty, most likely because of his size, ''Humpty Dumpty'' being a common insult for the overweight. Thompson was shot down (''Humpty Dumpty had a great fall'') and, shortly after, the town was lost to the Parliamentarians (''all the king's horses and all the king's men / couldn't put Humpty together again.'') Another version says that Humpty Dumpty was a cannon on the top of the church. The church of St Mary-at-the-Walls still retains its Norman tower until the top few feet, which are a Georgian repair.\n\nThe third rhyme said to have come from Colchester is [[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]], which was written by [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]]  who lived in the town's Dutch Quarter, and published in 1806 with the title \"The Star\".\n\nColchester has also been suggested as one of the potential sites of [[Camelot]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Nash Ford|first=David|title=Early British Kingdoms: Colchester|url=http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211112608/http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|archivedate=11 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> on account of having been the capital of Roman Britain and its ancient name of ''Camulodunum'': this is not considered likely by academics, as in Arthurian times Colchester was under Saxon control.\n\nThe first part of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' was set in Colchester.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nColchester was also a named line of [[lathe]] machinery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |title=As detailed here |publisher=Lathes.co.uk |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102004031/http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe opening credits for the British TV comedy show [[Blackadder Goes Forth]] and a scene from the film [[Monty Python and the Meaning of Life]] were both filmed at [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester's former cavalry barracks]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] Colchester was the scene of a nuclear detonation.\n\nThe ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes ''[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]'' are set in Colchester, although they were filmed in [[Cardiff]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Wales |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |title=IGN review |publisher=ign.com |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617223502/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |archivedate=17 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Asterix]] comic book ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'' the [[Camulodunum]] rugby team wins a game against [[Durovernum]] (Roman name for [[Canterbury]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goscinny|first1=Ren\u00e9|last2=Underzo|first2=Albert|title=Asterix in Britain|series=Asterix #3|year=1973|publisher=Hodder Dargaud|isbn=0-340-17221-5|page=38}}</ref> The uniforms worn during the match in the book are similar to the modern kit of [[Colchester United]].\n\nProminent members of [[Blur (band)|Blur]], a popular 1990s music group met at school in Colchester.<ref>{{cite news|title=Colchester: how a shared 'fly pie' may bring Britpop band Blur back to Colchester|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|newspaper=Daily Gazette|date=22 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512110935/http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Princesses on Parade\" sequence in the 1994 film ''[[The Swan Princess]]'', one of the princesses in the beauty pageant is said to come from Colchester.
