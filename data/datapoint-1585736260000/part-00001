In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to [[Stewart International Airport]], in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].\n\nThe first scheduled airline flights were by [[American Airlines]] in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York [[LaGuardia Airport]] to HPN continuing to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] and beyond and returning in the evening. [[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>Feb. 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s. [[American Airlines]] also resumed mainline service.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.  Smaller regional and commuter air carriers that previously operated flights included Air North, [[Altair Airlines]], [[Business Express Airlines]], [[Boston-Maine Airways]] (operating as [[Pan Am Clipper Connection]]), [[Brockway Air]], [[Command Airways]], [[Commuter Airlines]], [[Continental Express]] (now [[United Express]]), [[Empire Airlines]], [[Independence Air]], [[Island Airlines|Island Air]], [[Mall Airways]] and [[USAir Express]].<ref name=\"departedflights.com\">http://www.departedflights.com, Official Airline Guide for April 1, 1981; Feb. 15, 1985; Dec. 15, 1989; Oct. 1, 1991; April 2, 1995</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">OAG Flight Guide Worldwide, Feb. 2007</ref>\n\nThese airlines operated the following jets to the airport:<ref name=\"departedflights.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Official Airline Guide (OAG), Feb. 1, 1976</ref>\n\n* [[Air Florida]] - [[Boeing 737-200]]\n* [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]] - [[Boeing 717-200]]\n* [[Allegheny Airlines]] - [[BAC One-Eleven]]\n* [[American Airlines]] - [[Fokker 100]]\n* [[Carnival Air Lines]] - [[Boeing 737-200]]\n* [[Continental Express]] - [[Embraer ERJ-135]] (operated by [[ExpressJet]] for [[Continental Airlines]])\n* [[Empire Airlines]] - [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]]\n* [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] - [[Douglas DC-9-10]]\n* [[Mohawk Airlines]] - [[BAC One-Eleven]]\n* [[Northwest Airlines]] - [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]\n* [[Republic Airlines (1979-1986)]] - [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]\n* [[United Airlines]] - [[Boeing 737-200]], [[737-300]] and [[737-500]]\n* [[USAir]] - [[Fokker 100]]\n\nIn addition to the above, [[Northwest Jetlink]] operated by [[Mesaba Airlines]] flew [[Avro RJ85]]s to the airport for [[Northwest Airlines]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photo of Northwest Jetlink Avro RJ-85 on final to Westchester County Airport</ref>\n\nIn summer 1981 [[Air Florida]]'s timetable showed nonstop [[Boeing 737-200]]s to [[L.F.

The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated.

JetBlue and Delta are the only airlines with mainline jet aircraft at HPN.\n\nIn June 2009, [[Cape Air]] commenced service to Westchester with flights to [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]]. Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use the aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. This is said officially to improve service, but actually exists to pacify anti-airport residents who reside in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nHPN is nestled between many existing neighborhoods and has many rules that must be followed.  HPN officials started the Westchester County Airport Aircraft Noise study which set up Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring Systems (ANOMS) around the airport.  The ANOMS measure the sound in the surveying area and compare it to the sound of airplanes and the sound of the neighborhoods surrounding the airport.  With the help of these devices, HPN officials have located the problems where noise is affecting the area the most.\n\nHPN has implemented six programs that help reduce noise.  The first program as stated earlier is the Voluntary Restraint from Flying or VRFF.  The VRFF is a curfew for planes to encourage them not to fly during the hours of midnight to six in the morning.  Another program is High Range Noise Event Program which uses the ANOMS.  If an ANOMS pick up reading of higher than 90 decibels that airplane is then contacted by HPN officials.  HPN also has programs that do not allow airplane larger than 12,500 pounds to takeoff at the runway intersections, or run-up their engines without prior approval of airport operations.\n\n==Local context==\nAfter several renovations, as well as discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=1989-12-07 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 | language = }}</ref> the airport is currently served by six scheduled passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations in the [[United States]].

Although varied in services offered, the FBOs at Westchester County Airport provide [[Jet A]] and [[100LL]] fueling services, repairs and maintenance, aircraft tiedowns, [[de-icing]], [[US Customs|United States Customs]], and other aircraft services. Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation.

In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to [[Stewart International Airport]], in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].\n\nThe first scheduled airline flights were by [[American Airlines]] in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York [[LaGuardia Airport]] to HPN continuing to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] and beyond and returning in the evening. [[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>Feb. 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.

The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated.

JetBlue and Delta are the only airlines with mainline jet aircraft at HPN.\n\nIn June 2009, [[Cape Air]] commenced service to Westchester with flights to [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]]. Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use the aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. This is said officially to improve service, but actually exists to pacify anti-airport residents who reside in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nHPN is nestled between many existing neighborhoods and has many rules that must be followed.  HPN officials started the Westchester County Airport Aircraft Noise study which set up Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring Systems (ANOMS) around the airport.  The ANOMS measure the sound in the surveying area and compare it to the sound of airplanes and the sound of the neighborhoods surrounding the airport.  With the help of these devices, HPN officials have located the problems where noise is affecting the area the most.\n\nHPN has implemented six programs that help reduce noise.  The first program as stated earlier is the Voluntary Restraint from Flying or VRFF.  The VRFF is a curfew for planes to encourage them not to fly during the hours of midnight to six in the morning.  Another program is High Range Noise Event Program which uses the ANOMS.  If an ANOMS pick up reading of higher than 90 decibels that airplane is then contacted by HPN officials.  HPN also has programs that do not allow airplane larger than 12,500 pounds to takeoff at the runway intersections, or run-up their engines without prior approval of airport operations.\n\n==Local context==\nAfter several renovations, as well as discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=1989-12-07 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 | language = }}</ref> the airport is currently served by six scheduled passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations in the [[United States]].

Although varied in services offered, the FBOs at Westchester County Airport provide [[Jet A]] and [[100LL]] fueling services, repairs and maintenance, aircraft tiedowns, [[de-icing]], [[US Customs|United States Customs]], and other aircraft services. Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation.

The project will expand the terminal by 20% and include additional check-in, screening and passenger waiting areas. The expansion will also include the addition of four new [[Jetbridges|jet bridges]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Cape Air]] | [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Provincetown Airport|Provincetown]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Air Lines]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport|Detroit]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[JetBlue]] | [[Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]], [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]<ref>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181113005796/en/Start-Planning-Summer-JetBlue-Service-Nantucket-Year</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Rectrix Aviation|Rectrix Shuttle]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Tradewind Aviation]] |[[Logan International Airport|Boston]] <br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Morrisville\u2013Stowe State Airport|Stowe]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=Tradewind Aviation adds Westchester County \u2013 Stowe service in W19 |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/287008/tradewind-aviation-adds-westchester-county-stowe-service-in-w19/ |website=Routesonline |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[United Express]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]]\n<!-- -->\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Airline market share===\n{{Bar graph\n| title = '''Carrier Shares for May 2018 \u2013 April 2019'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1&Airport=HPN&Airport_Name=White%20Plains,%20NY:%20Westchester%20County&carrier=FACTS |title=OST_R &#124; BTS &#124; Transtats |publisher=Transtats.bts.gov |date= |accessdate=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n| bar_width   = 45\n| width_units = em\n| label_type  = Carrier\n| data_type   = Passengers (arriving and departing)\n| data_max    = 778,000\n| label1   = [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]]\n| data1    = 778,000\n| comment1 = 48.52%\n| label2   = [[Endeavor Air|Endeavor]]\n| data2    = 193,000\n| comment2 = 12.04%\n| label3   = [[PSA Airlines|PSA]]\n| data3    = 193,000\n| comment3 = 12.01%\n| label4   = [[SkyWest Airlines|SkyWest]]\n| data4    = 189,000\n| comment4 = 11.81%\n| label5   = [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]\n| data5    = 124,000\n| comment5 = 7.71%\n| label6   = Other\n| data6    = 127,000\n| comment6 = 7.92%\n}}\n\n===Top destinations===\n<!--[[File:Westchester County Airport Destinations.gif|300px|thumb|Non-stop destinations from Westchester County Airport]]-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|+ '''Busiest Domestic Routes from HPN<br />(May 2018 \u2013 April 2019)'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\"/>\n|-\n!
