He will expand his chest and fluff out the feathers on his forehead. After mating, the female will lay a clutch of about 4\u20138 eggs. Both parents help brood the eggs during the daytime, and it is the female who stays on the eggs at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents care for the young. Gouldian finches leave the nest after between 19 and 23 days and are completely independent at 40 days old.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nGouldian finches have brightly coloured gapes and call loudly when the parent birds return so that they are able to find and feed their mouths in the dark nest.<ref>Attenbourgh, David. ''The Life of Birds'', Episode 9, 3 mins, 55 s.</ref>\n\nIt has been shown that female Gouldian finches from Northern Australia can control the sex of their offspring by choosing mates according to their head color. A certain amount of genetic incompatibility between black and red-headed birds can result in high mortality (up to 80%) in female offspring when birds of different head colours mate. If the female mates with a finch of different head colour, this genetic incompatibility can be addressed by over-producing sons, up to a ratio of four males to one female. This is one of the first proven instances of birds biasing the sex of their offspring to overcome genetic weaknesses.<ref name=pryke>{{cite journal|last1=Pryke|first1=S.R.|last2=Griffith|first2=S.C.|year=2009|title=Genetic incompatibility drives sex allocation and maternal investment in a polymorphic finch|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5921|pages=1605\u20131607|doi=10.1126/science.1168928|bibcode=2009Sci...323.1605P}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/bird-controls-offsprings-gender-09-03-20|publisher=Scientific American|title=Bird Controls Offspring's Gender}}</ref>\n\n==Aviculture==\nGouldian finches are a popular species in aviculture because of their striking colors and, like all finches, they are also quite low maintenance.<ref name=\":1\" /> Gouldian finches get along well with other species of grass finch and some other docile species of bird, such as [[waxbill]]s and [[parrot finch]]es.<ref>https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/species/lady-gouldian-finch/></ref>\n\n=== Trapping for aviculture ===\nIn the Kimberley District of Western Australia, where most wild Gouldian finch were trapped for aviculture, it was often reported as one of the more common of the eleven finch species.  Until 1977, it was trapped in greater numbers than any other finch.  From 1897, when finch trapping started in the Kimberley, it was the most sought after finch by trappers and the most desired by fanciers.  Between the years 1934 and 1939, the Gouldian finch was the most exported single finch species.  The Perth Zoo exported 22,064 finches of which 12,509 were Gouldian.  Private dealers exported 35,315 finches, of which 14,504  were Gouldian.  The number of finches taken in the 1958 finch trapping season was the largest for one year, of the 38,649 finches taken, 11,286 were Gouldian.  The last licensed trapping of Gouldian finch in Western Australia was on 15 November 1981.  In that year's finch trapping season, of the 23,450 finches taken 1,054 were Gouldian.<ref>Finch Trapping in the Kimberley, K H Coate and L H Merritt (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-85905-621-2}} \u2013 ref Fisheries Department, table, trapped birds export statistics 1935\u20131939 22 August 1939, SROWA CONS 477, ITEM 1934-0059; and Department of Conservation and Land Management, table, Annual Finch Trapping Since 1968 1986.

Fires are listed as the primary threat to the natural populations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wwf.org.au/what-we-do/species/gouldian-finch#gs.SRXFq2I|title=Gouldian finch - WWF-Australia|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianwildlife.org/wildlife/gouldian-finch.aspx|title=Australian Wildlife Conservancy|website=www.australianwildlife.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref>\n\n*\n*\n\n==Behaviour==\nOutside the breeding season, Gouldian finches often join mixed flocks consisting of [[long-tailed finch]]es and [[masked finch]]es.

During the dry season, they mainly forage on the ground for seeds. During the wet season, spinifex grass seed (''[[Triodia (plant genus)|Triodia]]'' sp.) is an important part of their diet. So far Gouldians have been recorded eating six different species of grass seed, but researchers have yet to find evidence of insect consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beautyofbirds.com/gouldianfinch.html#diet|title=Gouldian Finches or Rainbow Finches {{!}} Beauty of Birds|website=www.beautyofbirds.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Diamant de Gould oisillons.jpg|thumb|left|Newly hatched Gouldian finch chicks]]\n[[File:GouldianFinchJuvenille CincinnatiZoo.jpg|thumb|right|A juvenile at [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]]]\nGouldian finches will usually make their nests in tree-holes.

He will expand his chest and fluff out the feathers on his forehead. After mating, the female will lay a clutch of about 4\u20138 eggs. Both parents help brood the eggs during the daytime, and it is the female who stays on the eggs at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents care for the young. Gouldian finches leave the nest after between 19 and 23 days and are completely independent at 40 days old.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nGouldian finches have brightly coloured gapes and call loudly when the parent birds return so that they are able to find and feed their mouths in the dark nest.<ref>Attenbourgh, David. ''The Life of Birds'', Episode 9, 3 mins, 55 s.</ref>\n\nIt has been shown that female Gouldian finches from Northern Australia can control the sex of their offspring by choosing mates according to their head color. A certain amount of genetic incompatibility between black and red-headed birds can result in high mortality (up to 80%) in female offspring when birds of different head colours mate. If the female mates with a finch of different head colour, this genetic incompatibility can be addressed by over-producing sons, up to a ratio of four males to one female. This is one of the first proven instances of birds biasing the sex of their offspring to overcome genetic weaknesses.<ref name=pryke>{{cite journal|last1=Pryke|first1=S.R.|last2=Griffith|first2=S.C.|year=2009|title=Genetic incompatibility drives sex allocation and maternal investment in a polymorphic finch|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5921|pages=1605\u20131607|doi=10.1126/science.1168928|bibcode=2009Sci...323.1605P}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/bird-controls-offsprings-gender-09-03-20|publisher=Scientific American|title=Bird Controls Offspring's Gender}}</ref>\n\n==Aviculture==\nGouldian finches are a popular species in aviculture because of their striking colors and, like all finches, they are also quite low maintenance.<ref name=\":1\" /> Gouldian finches get along well with other species of grass finch and some other docile species of bird, such as [[waxbill]]s and [[parrot finch]]es.<ref>https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/species/lady-gouldian-finch/></ref>\n\n=== Trapping for aviculture ===\nIn the Kimberley District of Western Australia, where most wild Gouldian finch were trapped for aviculture, it was often reported as one of the more common of the eleven finch species.  Until 1977, it was trapped in greater numbers than any other finch.  From 1897, when finch trapping started in the Kimberley, it was the most sought after finch by trappers and the most desired by fanciers.  Between the years 1934 and 1939, the Gouldian finch was the most exported single finch species.  The Perth Zoo exported 22,064 finches of which 12,509 were Gouldian.  Private dealers exported 35,315 finches, of which 14,504  were Gouldian.  The number of finches taken in the 1958 finch trapping season was the largest for one year, of the 38,649 finches taken, 11,286 were Gouldian.  The last licensed trapping of Gouldian finch in Western Australia was on 15 November 1981.  In that year's finch trapping season, of the 23,450 finches taken 1,054 were Gouldian.<ref>Finch Trapping in the Kimberley, K H Coate and L H Merritt (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-85905-621-2}} - ref Fisheries Department, table, trapped birds export statistics 1935-1939 22 August 1939, SROWA CONS 477, ITEM 1934-0059; and Department of Conservation and Land Management, table, Annual Finch Trapping Since 1968 1986.
