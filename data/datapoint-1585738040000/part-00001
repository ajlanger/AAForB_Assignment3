Athanassakis 1977, 43</ref>\n\nIn the Orphic tradition, Dionysus-Protogonos-Phanes is a dying and rising god. [[Eusebius]] tells us the story of his death and recreation. The [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] boil the dismembered limbs of Dionysus in a kettle, they roast him on a spit and eat the roasted \"sacrificial meat\", then [[Athena]] rescues the still-beating heart<ref>Euseb. Praep. ev. 2.3.25 (K. 35)</ref> from which (according to [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]])<ref>Olympiod. in Plat. Phaedon. 2.21 (K. 220)</ref> [[Zeus]] is able to recreate the god and bring him back to life. Kessler has argued that this cult of death and resurrection of Dionysus developed the 4th century CE; and together with [[Mithraism]] and other sects this cult formed, were in direct competition with [[Early Christianity]] during [[Late Antiquity]].<ref>E.
