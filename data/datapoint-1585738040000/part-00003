The river flows west, collecting various headwater tributaries. The Upper Santa Ynez Campground is located near the river's source. After flowing through Billiard Flats the river enters Jameson Lake, the reservoir impounded by Juncal Dam. Below the dam, Alder Creek joins the Santa Ynez River from the south. At times water from Alder Creek is diverted into Jameson Lake via a tunnel.<ref name=wdr2004/> \n[[File:DSC 1939-JamesonLake.jpg|thumb|West end of Jameson Lake, 2012]]\n[[Image:Aerial-LakeCachumaEastEnd.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lake Cachuma]], a reservoir on the Santa Ynez River. The river is visible at the far bottom of the image.]]\n\nContinuing its generally westward course, the Santa Ynez flows by several campgrounds and canyons, including Blue Canyon. Mono Creek joins from the north just as the Santa Ynez flows into Gibraltar Reservoir, impounded by [[Gibraltar Dam]]. Below this dam the river passes several campgrounds as well as facilities such as the Los Prietos Ranger Station. Paradise Road runs along the river. Continuing west, the river passes Fremont Campground near the mouth of Red Rock Canyon.\n\nWest of Red Rock Canyon the river leaves Los Padres National Forest and its valley widens considerably. Kelly Creek joins from the south, draining Los Laureles Canyon and Cold Spring Canyon. [[California State Route 154|State Route 154]], which crosses the Santa Ynez Mountains via [[San Marcos Pass]], enters the Santa Ynez River valley at this point and follows the river for several miles to the west. Hot Spring Canyon joins from the south just before the Santa Ynez River enters [[Lake Cachuma]].\n\nLake Cachuma, the largest reservoir on the river, is approximately five miles in length. Several tributaries join the Santa Ynez River in Lake Cachuma, including Santa Cruz Creek and Cachuma Creek from the north and a number of smaller streams from the south. The lake area is designated as the Lake Cachuma Recreation Area. Cachuma County Park, near Tequepis Point, provides lake access. Water from the lake is diverted into the Tecolote Tunnel, which passes south under the mountains to the Santa Barbara area.\n\nBelow Lake Cachuma, the Santa Ynez River continues its westward course. Its valley continues to widen and contains ranches and other development. The river passes by the town of [[Santa Ynez, California|Santa Ynez]] and the cities of [[Solvang, California|Solvang]] and [[Buellton, California|Buellton]]. In Buellton the river is crossed by [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]]. Several tributaries join the river in this area, including Quiota Creek, Alisal Creek, and Nojoqui Creek and [[Nojoqui Falls|Falls]] from the south, and Santa Agueda Creek,<ref>{{cite gnis|254216|Santa Agueda Creek}}</ref> Zanja de Cota Creek,<ref>{{cite gnis|253253|Zanja de Cota Creek}}</ref> Alamo Pintado Creek and Zaca Creek from the north.\n\nWest of Buellton the Santa Ynez River flows between the Santa Rita Hills and Purisima Hills to the north and the Santa Rosa Hills to the south. It is joined by Santa Rosa Creek from the north and [[Salsipuedes Creek (Santa Ynez River)|Salsipuedes Creek]]<ref>{{cite gnis|248752|Salsipuedes Creek}}</ref> from the south. Just west of Salsipuedes Creek the Santa Ynez River flows past the largest city in the valley, [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]]. A few miles west of Lompoc the river reaches the Pacific Ocean at a location known as Surf, where there is a beach and an [[Amtrak]] station. While there is public access to Surf and the mouth of the Santa Ynez River, most of the land between Lompoc and the ocean is part of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]].<ref>Course info from various sources including [http://www.topozone.com Topozone.com] and {{cite book | title = California Road & Recreation Atlas | edition = 4th | year = 2005 | publisher = [[Benchmark Maps]] | isbn = 0-929591-80-1 }}; and: {{cite book | title = Oregon Road & Recreation Atlas | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Benchmark Maps | isbn = 0-929591-50-X }}</ref>\n\n===Discharge===\nThe [[USGS]] operates several [[stream gage]]s along the Santa Ynez river.

[[Bradbury Dam]], which forms the lake, was built by the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]]. Water from Lake Cachuma is diverted into the Tecolote Tunnel, which passes south under the Santa Ynez Mountains. The tunnel supplies water to the city of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] (which uses it for [[drinking water]]), the [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] Water District, the [[Carpinteria, California|Carpinteria]] Valley Water District, and the [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] Water District.

Gibraltar Reservoir supplies water to the City of Santa Barbara via the Santa Barbara Water Tunnel under the Santa Ynez Mountains. Jameson Lake supplies water to the Montecito Water District via another tunnel under the Santa Ynez Mountains.

The river flows west, collecting various headwater tributaries. The Upper Santa Ynez Campground is located near the river's source. After flowing through Billiard Flats the river enters Jameson Lake, the reservoir impounded by Juncal Dam. Below the dam, Alder Creek joins the Santa Ynez River from the south. At times water from Alder Creek is diverted into Jameson Lake via a tunnel.<ref name=wdr2004/> \n[[File:DSC 1939-JamesonLake.jpg|thumb|West end of Jameson Lake, 2012]]\n[[Image:Aerial-LakeCachumaEastEnd.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lake Cachuma]], a reservoir on the Santa Ynez River. The river is visible at the far bottom of the image.]]\n\nContinuing its generally westward course, the Santa Ynez flows by several campgrounds and canyons, including Blue Canyon. Mono Creek joins from the north just as the Santa Ynez flows into Gibraltar Reservoir, impounded by [[Gibraltar Dam]]. Below this dam the river passes several campgrounds as well as facilities such as the Los Prietos Ranger Station. Paradise Road runs along the river. Continuing west, the river passes Fremont Campground near the mouth of Red Rock Canyon.\n\nWest of Red Rock Canyon the river leaves Los Padres National Forest and its valley widens considerably. Kelly Creek joins from the south, draining Los Laureles Canyon and Cold Spring Canyon. [[California State Route 154|State Route 154]], which crosses the Santa Ynez Mountains via [[San Marcos Pass]], enters the Santa Ynez River valley at this point and follows the river for several miles to the west. Hot Spring Canyon joins from the south just before the Santa Ynez River enters [[Lake Cachuma]].\n\nLake Cachuma, the largest reservoir on the river, is approximately five miles in length. Several tributaries join the Santa Ynez River in Lake Cachuma, including Santa Cruz Creek and Cachuma Creek from the north and a number of smaller streams from the south. The lake area is designated as the Lake Cachuma Recreation Area. Cachuma County Park, near Tequepis Point, provides lake access. Water from the lake is diverted into the Tecolote Tunnel, which passes south under the mountains to the Santa Barbara area.\n\nBelow Lake Cachuma, the Santa Ynez River continues its westward course. Its valley continues to widen and contains ranches and other development. The river passes by the town of [[Santa Ynez, California|Santa Ynez]] and the cities of [[Solvang, California|Solvang]] and [[Buellton, California|Buellton]]. In Buellton the river is crossed by [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]]. Several tributaries join the river in this area, including Quiota Creek, Alisal Creek, and Nojoqui Creek and [[Nojoqui Falls|Falls]] from the south, and Santa Agueda Creek,<ref>{{cite gnis|254216|Santa Agueda Creek}}</ref> Zanja de Cota Creek,<ref>{{cite gnis|253253|Zanja de Cota Creek}}</ref> Alamo Pintado Creek and Zaca Creek from the north.\n\nWest of Buellton the Santa Ynez River flows between the Santa Rita Hills and Purisima Hills to the north and the Santa Rosa Hills to the south. It is joined by Santa Rosa Creek from the north and [[Salsipuedes Creek (Santa Ynez River)|Salsipuedes Creek]]<ref>{{cite gnis|248752|Salsipuedes Creek}}</ref> from the south. Just west of Salsipuedes Creek the Santa Ynez River flows past the largest city in the valley, [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]]. A few miles west of Lompoc the river reaches the Pacific Ocean at a location known as Surf, where there is a beach and an [[Amtrak]] station. While there is public access to Surf and the mouth of the Santa Ynez River, most of the land between Lompoc and the ocean is part of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]].<ref>Course info from various sources including [http://www.topozone.com Topozone.com] and {{cite book | title = California Road & Recreation Atlas | edition = 4th | year = 2005 | publisher = [[Benchmark Maps]] | isbn = 0-929591-80-1 }}; and: {{cite book | title = Oregon Road & Recreation Atlas | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Benchmark Maps | isbn = 0-929591-50-X }}</ref>\n\n===Discharge===\nThe [[USGS]] operates several [[stream gage]]s along the Santa Ynez river.

[[Bradbury Dam]], which forms the lake, was built by the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]]. Water from Lake Cachuma is diverted into the Tecolote Tunnel, which passes south under the Santa Ynez Mountains. The tunnel supplies water to the city of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] (which uses it for [[drinking water]]), the [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] Water District, the [[Carpinteria, California|Carpinteria]] Valley Water District, and the [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] Water District.

Gibraltar Reservoir supplies water to the City of Santa Barbara via the Santa Barbara Water Tunnel under the Santa Ynez Mountains. Jameson Lake supplies water to the Montecito Water District via another tunnel under the Santa Ynez Mountains.
