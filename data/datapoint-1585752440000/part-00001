Abd al-Karim became the first Kolak (Sultan) of a dynasty that lasted until the arrival of the [[France|French]].\n\nDuring much of the 18th century, the history of Wadai is marked by wars with the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] and in the early 1700s under the rule of Abd al-Karim's grandson, Ya'qub Arus (1681-1707), the country suffered terrible drought that lasted for several years.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:Wadai region around 1890.svg|thumb|left|Wadai sultanate east of [[Lake Chad]] around 1890, from an American map]]\n\nAfter 1804, during the reign of [[Muhammad Sabun]] (r. 1804 - c. 1815), the Sultanate of Wadai began to expand its power as it profited considerably from its strategic position astride the [[trans-Saharan trade route]]s. A new trade route to the north was found, via [[Ennedi]], [[Kufra]] and [[Jalu]]-[[Awjila]] to [[Benghazi]], and Sabun outfitted royal caravans to take advantage of it. He began minting his own [[coin]]age and imported [[chain mail]], [[firearm]]s, and military advisers from [[North Africa]]. Sabun's successors were less able than he, and Darfur took advantage of a disputed political succession in 1838 to put its own candidate in power in [[Ouara]], the capital of Wadai. This tactic backfired, however, when Darfur's choice, [[Muhammad Sharif of Ouaddai|Muhammad Sharif]], rejected Darfur's meddling and asserted his own authority. In doing so, he gained acceptance from Wadai's various factions and went on to become Wadai's ablest ruler.\n\nSharif conducted military campaigns as far west as [[Borno State|Bornu]] and eventually established Wadai's hegemony over Baguirmi and kingdoms as far away as the [[Chari River]]. In [[Mecca]], Sharif had met the founder of the [[Senussi]] Islamic brotherhood, a movement that was strong among the inhabitants of [[Cyrenaica]] (in present-day [[Libya]]) and that was to become a dominant political force and source of resistance to [[French colonial empires|French colonization]].\n\n===Decline===\n{{main|Ouaddai War}}\n[[Image:Cavalerieafrique.jpg|right|thumb|'''Last charge of the cavalry.'''
