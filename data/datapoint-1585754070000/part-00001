It is then revealed that he was serving time for a crime he did not commit because Leela's mother [[Sam Lomax]] ([[Lizzie Roper]]) set him up. Sam then visited him in prison before Leela ordering him not to see her otherwise she'll make sure that he will do more time. Cameron reluctantly agrees but then gets his parole moved up. Later when Sam is getting off work Cameron is seen in the back of her car and forces her to drive away from the village and scares her as revenge for what she did to him. He then reveals that he's sticking around in the village.\n\nHe gets a job as co-chef in The Hutch and befriends Leela's half-brother [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) much to the horror of Sam and [[Danny Lomax|Danny]] ([[Stephen Billington]]). Cameron later confronts Leela about Peri asking if she's his daughter. Leela denies it at first but later tells him the truth. Terrified of Peri finding out the truth, Sam and Danny arrange to take her and their other daughter [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis) to New Zealand. Peri becomes depressed at this and drinks a whole bottle of wine, and she is found by Cameron, who she moans to about not wanting to leave. Later angry that Cameron's the reason their leaving, Ste confronts him, but accidentally tells Cameron their leaving. Cameron then tells Leela what Peri told him about not wanting to leave, and they confront Sam and Danny, revealing to Peri that they are her parents, much to the shock of Tegan, Ste and Peri. When Peri later goes missing Cameron goes out in the van looking for her, and accidentally smashes into Sam and Danny's car, killing them. He then flees the scene. He is present at the Lomax house the next day when Leela, Tegan, Ste and [[Ziggy Roscoe]] (Fabrizio Santino) learn of their deaths and goes with Leela to identify their bodies. Later he supports Peri when she believes her brain tumor has returned; but it's just a false alarm. He then smashes Sam's wreath just before the funeral, and strikes a deal with [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) to plant evidence in Sam's things; including a false confession saying she killed [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]). When Peri is furious that Leela and Tegan believe the note, she moves in with Cameron. Cameron and Ziggy later fall out over Leela, Cameron sets him up by having him drive out to the van that killed Sam and Danny, realizing what it is Ziggy tries to burn it but is arrested by police.\n\nDuring the hospital siege, Cameron sticks with Leela and tries to get into the lift to rescue Tegan and Ziggy but the lift shaft falls, much to their horror. He then protects Leela from [[#Big Bob|Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]) deflecting the bullet he shot at her back at him, killing him. When his brother [[#Lockie Campbell|Lockie Campbell]] (Nick Rhys) arrives in the village, he reveals to Cameron that he's engaged, and asks him to be his best man. After the wedding train crashes, Cameron helps rescue [[Phoebe McQueen]] (Mandip Gill) from the wreckage and gets the doors open allowing the passengers to escape. Cameron then finds out from Ziggy that Tegan has cancer, so he supports her, encouraging her to tell Leela the truth. Leela then admits she has feelings for him and they begin a relationship much to Peri's delight. When the Lomaxes fall behind with their bills, Cameron breaks into The Dog to get money for them and he narrowly avoids being caught. In January 2015, he reads a text from Peri's mobile phone from her boyfriend [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]) and correctly assumes that they had sex. When he confronts them about it at school, they lie but a humiliated Peri stows away with Tegan and Ziggy as they prepare to go on holiday. Ziggy then phones Cameron and Leela and they go to collect her. While there Cameron eats soup laced with magic mushrooms and accidentally reveals to Leela that he killed Sam and Danny. Leela tries to call the police but she changes her mind and forces him to leave the village instead.\n\nCameron then returns weeks later when Lockie needs to raise money. He then reveals to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny, and helps him raise the money by robbing their mother's old boyfriend. Upon his return he learns about Peri's pregnancy and Leela lets him stay for her sake. On Leela and Ziggy's wedding day he kidnaps Leela and she reveals she can never love him for what he's done \u2013 unaware that the wedding camera has recorded the whole thing. Cameron eventually lets Leela go, but is blackmailed by Tom who has seen the footage. Cameron convinces Tom to keep quiet as it would destroy Peri if she found out. Cameron starts a relationship with [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) after he helps her rob a house to raise money. He then supports her when her boss [[#Dr. Charles S'avage|Dr. Charles S'avage]] (Andrew Greenough) finds out the truth, but uncovers the truth about him being a fraud and strikes a deal with him: forget what Celine did and he will not tell anybody about his secret. Dr. S'avage agrees and Cameron uses the money he raised from the house to finance a new restaurant after Lockie caused him to lose his job. Tom later blackmails Cameron to stop Peri having their child be adopted, but Cameron refuses to do so. Tom then uploads the video of what Cameron did to the student-teacher messaging board, but changes his mind at the last minute. He forgets to however delete the video and it is accidentally sent by Ste and [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2007)#Harry Thompson|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]). Peri goes into labour after hearing the confession and Cameron, Leela and Tom help her deliver her daughter, [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)#Steph Cunningham-Lomax|Steph]]. Peri then calls the police on Cameron. Leela says she can help him run but Cameron refuses, and apologises to Peri and Celine and tells them he loves them, and asks Tom to look after Peri and Steph before handing himself into the police.\n\nCameron is found not guilty after Leela gives a positive character portrayal to the jury. Tegan, Peri, Ziggy and Ste are furious and disown Leela as they believe she still has feelings for Cameron after everything he has done. In December 2015, Leela and Peri decide to leave the village after Leela discovers that Ziggy and Tegan have feelings for one another. Cameron is furious as he does not know where they have gone and ends his relationship with Celine when she lies that Peri has contacted her. After Leela collects Peri from the village a few weeks later, she tells Cameron that he will never see his daughter again. This results in Cameron confessing to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny on purpose and will kill Leela for keeping him away from Peri. After following Ziggy to Peri and Leela's new flat, he breaks in, turns all the gas on and locks all the doors while Leela is asleep and Peri is out. When Ziggy drops a present off for Peri later, he wakes Leela and she realises that there is a gas leak, so Ziggy breaks the door down and the pair escape as the building explodes; however, Ziggy hits his head as he and Leela are blown away by the explosion. He later dies from his injuries, leaving Tegan heartbroken.\n\nIn 2016, after Ste moves back in with his family, Cameron resents his presence and gets him addicted to [[crystal meth]], which he finds very difficult to overcome. Disgusted by Ste, Leela and Tegan ask him to leave, so he moves in with Harry and his father [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), much to Cameron's delight. It later transpires that Cameron murdered Lockie after he discovered that Cameron caused the explosion that killed Ziggy, and this secret comes under threat by the arrival of his cousin, [[Courtney Campbell (Hollyoaks)|Courtney Campbell]] (Amy Conachan), who is desperate to find out where Lockie is. Cameron continues to lie to those he loves, including telling Courtney that he has already had Lockie cremated. Cameron is furious when he discovers that Peri's best friend, [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) has become obsessed with her and held her hostage, and so at the \"Halloween Spooktacular\" festival, Cameron sets fire to the wooden maze where Nico and her mother, [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) are. The building is engulfed by flames, and Sienna is rescued, despite her pleas for Nico to be saved. Nico is then killed when the entire structure collapses on her, leaving Sienna distraught. Elsewhere, [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) and [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) are trapped on a ferris wheel, and after Mercedes is saved, an explosion caused by the fire started by Cameron sees Joe fall from the ferris wheel, and later dying in hospital. Cameron later discovers that Celine has footage of him setting the maze on fire, but after overhearing Celine confessing to Tegan that she attempted to murder her stepfather [[Pete Buchanan]] ([[Kai Owen]]), Cameron blackmails Celine into keeping quiet.\n\nCameron begins to panic when Celine threatens to confess to the police the truth about the fire. He confronts Celine before luring her into an abandoned shed where he holds Celine hostage. Later, Cameron visits Celine where she begs him to release her, promising that she will keep quiet about the fire and that she can live with the guilt. Cameron visits Celine's boyfriend, [[Jesse Donovan]] (Luke Jerdy), and, believing Jesse to be totally oblivious to the person responsible for causing the fire, returns to Celine with the possible intention of releasing her. However, on the way to the shack, Cameron intercepts a voice message from Jesse to Celine making him realise that Jesse knows more than he was letting on. Cameron confronts Celine and tearfully tells her that he has no other way to keep her silence but to kill her, promising to make it as quick as possible before strangling her to death, and dumping her corpse in the lake. On Cameron's wedding day to Leela, she gives birth prematurely and the baby is placed in an incubator to help him breathe. Leela names the baby [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#Daniel|Daniel]], after her father Danny. Cameron notices a bruise on the baby and verbally attacks the staff, believing them to be abusing Daniel but it transpires to be a [[Mongolian blue spot]], which is common in mixed race babies.

Dr. S'avage is [[Dennis Savage]]'s ([[Joe Tracini]]) father, and [[Dirk Savage]]'s ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) brother. Dr. S'avage is estranged from Dennis after leaving him to pursue his medical career and has been billed as pompous, as well as having changed his surname to escape from his roots. Dr. S'avage takes charge of a young team of doctors who include [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]), [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis), [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) and other newcomers. Dr. S'avage's introductory storyline saw him taken hostage by [[Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]).<ref name=\"newoakscastings\" /> Dr. S'avage died during the episode that aired on 20 October when, after discovering the Gloved Hand Killer's identity, he was killed by them. His exit was not announced prior to the episode's airing, making it a surprise for viewers.\n\nDr. S'avage is first mentioned by his son Dennis, and informs his cousin [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton) of how his father left him with Dirk to pursue his medical career at the time, when he was kidnapped by Will. One year later, Dr. S'avage first appears talking to Kim and it is revealed he has recently been hired to work at Dee Valley Hospital. During the hospital siege he tries to stand up to Big Bob when [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) is shot, but he was overpowered. He then promises to help [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) get her job back. It is then revealed that he is the father of Dennis who he left in his brother, Dirk's, care when Dennis was a child so he could work abroad. Dennis and Dr. S'avage have a hard time reconciling, especially when Dr. S'avage disapproves of Dennis' transgender girlfriend [[Blessing Chambers]] ([[Modupe Adeyeye]]). Dr. S'avage then stops Dennis after he threatens to blow up [[Trevor Royle]]'s ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) flat in revenge for Trevor killing his wife, [[Leanne Holiday]] (Jessica Forrest), one year prior.\n\nDr. S'avage then reveals to Tegan that the reason her daughter [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Rose Lomax|Rose]]'s blood transfusion did not work was because  Rose was a different blood type than what Tegan was told at her birth, meaning Rose is not her biological daughter. He then informs Tegan that her cancer treatment has not worked and to [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) that his cancer treatment has made him infertile. After the baby swap dilemma comes to light, the midwife who switched them, [[Mariam Andrews]] ([[Helen Lederer]]), is revealed to be Dr. S'avage's ex-wife. Mariam then blackmails Dr. S'avage into helping her, threatening to reveal a secret of his if he does not. Dr. S'avage then places Mariam in a mental ward which is witnessed by [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]). Sienna then gets close to Mariam to try and uncover his secret, and Dr. S'avage, panicking, promises to get her out. Dr. S'avage is angry at his nephew Will for kidnapping Dennis two years prior, and also supports Dirk when he reveals he is being blackmailed over letting his son Will die, but Dr. S'avage tells him he has nothing to feel guilty about. He also helps him set up traps to catch the blackmailer, who is later revealed to be [[Robbie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Wernham]]).\n\nSienna and Dr. S'avage grow closer over the following weeks, which a newly released Mariam is jealous about so she reveals Dr. S'avage's secret: he never fully qualified as a doctor. This panics Sienna as he is treating her daughter, [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]), who has a kidney infection. Dr. S'avage, however, assures her that he has never miss-diagnosed a patient and that if the truth comes out she may be deemed fit to stand trial and could end up in prison. When Mariam accuses him of killing patients, he denies it and Sienna helps destroy the evidence of him not qualifying as a doctor. When Mariam is found dead in his office after being murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Sienna gives him an alibi. A few weeks later, Dr. S'avage finds Sienna suffering an allergic reaction from a bee sting after Nico abandoned her and encourages Sienna to report Nico to Social Services as she needs help. Sienna agrees but later regrets her decision and has an argument with Dr. S'avage about it, before breaking down in tears. Dr. S'avage comforts her and they share a kiss. Sienna tells him later that she just sees him as a father figure, devastating him. [[Reenie McQueen]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]) then starts flirting with him to get his money, but Dr. S'avage does not believe Sienna when she tells him. After Sienna pushes Reenie down the city stairs, Dr. S'avage helps her cover it up after she admits she needed him by blackmailing Reenie over her using his credit card. He then treats Sienna's wounds after Reenie attacks her and promises to mend her wicker make of the Titanic, which Reenie also destroyed.\n\nIn August 2015, Dr. S'avage discovers that Nico murdered [[Carly Bradley]] (Sophie Wise) while protecting Sienna and tries to cover it up, but the police are called by Celine. He panics when Nico is arrested, but she is later released. He also treats [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) after a car explosion and is seen outside when the Gloved Hand Killer murdered [[Dylan Jenkins]] (James Fletcher), ruling him out as a suspect. He then becomes suspicious of Dylan's death and when [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) finds the Gloved Hand Killer's locker with photos of their victims, she shares what she found with Dr. S'avage. Dr. S'avage then finds a strand of hair in the locker and orders all his staff to take a drug test in an attempt to find out who it is. However, Celine panics as she is using hospital appetite suppressants to get thin and she switches her DNA sample in order to throw the scent off her. Dr. S'avage places a camera in the drugs locker to try and catch the killer, but it fails. Later, when [[Ashley Davidson]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]) is murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Dr. S'avage uses the CCTV camera he placed in Ashley's room and succeedingly catches the killer. But, when advancing into the Hollyoaks Pride Festival, he calls Cindy to tell her who the killer is, unaware that the killer is behind him, armed with a syringe. Dr. S'avage is then injured when he is struck by a falling beam after Trevor shot it down by accident. In the confusion, the killer reaches Dr. S'avage and fatally injects him with a large dose of [[potassium chloride]], which was witnessed by young [[Charlie Dean]] (Charlie Behan). Dr. S'avage descends into [[cardiac arrest]] and is rushed to hospital, but dies when being resuscitated. Dirk is devastated by this as they always argued with each other. However, Cindy is adamant that the Gloved Hand Killer murdered him. Lindsey is later revealed as the killer soon after Dr. S'avage's death.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|name= Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen\n|portrayed= uncredited \n|introduced= Bryan Kirkwood\n|years= 2014\u20132016\n|first= 15 October 2014\n|last= 11 March 2016\n|classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2016|Former; recurring]]\n|home= [[Spain]] (2016\u2013)\n|family= [[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n|father= [[Dodger Savage]] \n|mother= [[Theresa McQueen]] \n|halfsisters= [[Nico Blake]] <br>  [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]]\n|grandfathers= [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] <br> [[William Alexander (Hollyoaks)|William Alexander]]\n| grandmothers= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Anna Blake|Anna Blake]] <br> [[Kathleen McQueen]] \n|uncles= [[Will Savage]]\n|aunts= [[Mercedes McQueen]] <br> [[Jacqui McQueen]] <br> [[Sienna Blake]] <br> [[#Minnie Minniver|Minnie Minniver]]\n|nieces=  [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2018)#Victoria Blake|Victoria Blake]]\n|cousins= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2011)|Bobby Costello]] <br> [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2017)#Sophie Blake|Sophie Blake]]<br>[[Sebastian Blake]]\n|relatives= [[Myra McQueen]] <br> [[Reenie McQueen]] <br> [[Carmel McQueen]] <br> [[John Paul McQueen]] <br> [[#Porsche McQueen|Porsche McQueen]] <br> [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] <br> [[Cleo McQueen]] <br> [[Matthew McQueen]]\n}}\n'''Myra-Pocahontas Regina Madonna Savage-McQueen''' is a daughter of [[Dodger Savage]] ([[Danny Mac]]) and [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) and half-sister of [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]) and [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]] (Nieve Grandison).

When Pete comes back into their lives, troubled Reenie desperately wants him to stay and the girls want their mum to be in a happier place \u2013 but letting him into their home brings with it devastating consequences.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks'' and child protection charity, the [[NSPCC]] have both been announced to offer support online over the course of the storyline and are set to promote a 'No Secrets' campaign, which will target to help youth find necessary help if they were to face a similar situation.<ref name=Sexualabuse/>\n\nNSPCC lead for tackling sexual abuse, Jon Brown, spoke about the upcoming storyline and sexual abuse in children: \"Well-researched storylines in soaps can help raise awareness of difficult and important issues, reaching millions of people and helping those affected reach out for support. Sexual abuse is a crime that rips apart families and I am very pleased with the way that Hollyoaks has thoughtfully approached an enormously emotive and challenging subject. Sexual abuse of children within families is disturbingly the most common form and the impact on victims is devastating, sometimes damaging them long into adulthood if they don't get the right support. Children can stay silent for fear of what speaking out will do to the relationships they have with other members of the family. Abusers may cynically use this fear to keep children silent, leaving them suffering a daily nightmare. Its important children know that help is out there and they can move forward positively.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks''' executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood spoke about how viewers should be aware that [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]) suffered sexual abuse within her family, and how the research that the ''Hollyoaks'' team did found that abuse can in fact infiltrate generations. He continued to speak about what he hopes to achieve: \"Her daughter Reenie is as much the victim here as her daughters in that her own childhood was filled with such unclear boundaries that she is unable to spot the markers that mean her own girls are at risk. But this is not a hopeless story \u2013 far from it. It will endeavour to show that we do have the power to stop abuse and most importantly that it is possible to recover and to go on and have a happy and successful life. The campaign 'no secrets' is a simple message that can be used to encourage adults not to ask children to keep secrets and let children know that they shouldn't have secrets either. It is the secrets kept by generations of this family that have led to what we will see play out on screen this year.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> It was then revealed that Nana's ex-partner, [[Derek Clough]] ([[Bruce Montague]]), was her real father as Reenie was raped by him.\n\nPorsche's final scenes were filmed on 12 November 2015, and were broadcast on 24 December 2015.

It is then revealed that he was serving time for a crime he did not commit because Leela's mother [[Sam Lomax]] ([[Lizzie Roper]]) set him up. Sam then visited him in prison before Leela ordering him not to see her otherwise she'll make sure that he will do more time. Cameron reluctantly agrees but then gets his parole moved up. Later when Sam is getting off work Cameron is seen in the back of her car and forces her to drive away from the village and scares her as revenge for what she did to him. He then reveals that he's sticking around in the village.\n\nHe gets a job as co-chef in The Hutch and befriends Leela's half-brother [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) much to the horror of Sam and [[Danny Lomax|Danny]] ([[Stephen Billington]]). Cameron later confronts Leela about Peri asking if she's his daughter. Leela denies it at first but later tells him the truth. Terrified of Peri finding out the truth, Sam and Danny arrange to take her and their other daughter [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis) to New Zealand. Peri becomes depressed at this and drinks a whole bottle of wine, and she is found by Cameron, who she moans to about not wanting to leave. Later angry that Cameron's the reason their leaving, Ste confronts him, but accidentally tells Cameron their leaving. Cameron then tells Leela what Peri told him about not wanting to leave, and they confront Sam and Danny, revealing to Peri that they are her parents, much to the shock of Tegan, Ste and Peri. When Peri later goes missing Cameron goes out in the van looking for her, and accidentally smashes into Sam and Danny's car, killing them. He then flees the scene. He is present at the Lomax house the next day when Leela, Tegan, Ste and [[Ziggy Roscoe]] (Fabrizio Santino) learn of their deaths and goes with Leela to identify their bodies. Later he supports Peri when she believes her brain tumor has returned; but it's just a false alarm. He then smashes Sam's wreath just before the funeral, and strikes a deal with [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) to plant evidence in Sam's things; including a false confession saying she killed [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]). When Peri is furious that Leela and Tegan believe the note, she moves in with Cameron. Cameron and Ziggy later fall out over Leela, Cameron sets him up by having him drive out to the van that killed Sam and Danny, realizing what it is Ziggy tries to burn it but is arrested by police.\n\nDuring the hospital siege, Cameron sticks with Leela and tries to get into the lift to rescue Tegan and Ziggy but the lift shaft falls, much to their horror. He then protects Leela from [[#Big Bob|Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]) deflecting the bullet he shot at her back at him, killing him. When his brother [[#Lockie Campbell|Lockie Campbell]] (Nick Rhys) arrives in the village, he reveals to Cameron that he's engaged, and asks him to be his best man. After the wedding train crashes, Cameron helps rescue [[Phoebe McQueen]] (Mandip Gill) from the wreckage and gets the doors open allowing the passengers to escape. Cameron then finds out from Ziggy that Tegan has cancer, so he supports her, encouraging her to tell Leela the truth. Leela then admits she has feelings for him and they begin a relationship much to Peri's delight. When the Lomaxes fall behind with their bills, Cameron breaks into The Dog to get money for them and he narrowly avoids being caught. In January 2015, he reads a text from Peri's mobile phone from her boyfriend [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]) and correctly assumes that they had sex. When he confronts them about it at school, they lie but a humiliated Peri stows away with Tegan and Ziggy as they prepare to go on holiday. Ziggy then phones Cameron and Leela and they go to collect her. While there Cameron eats soup laced with magic mushrooms and accidentally reveals to Leela that he killed Sam and Danny. Leela tries to call the police but she changes her mind and forces him to leave the village instead.\n\nCameron then returns weeks later when Lockie needs to raise money. He then reveals to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny, and helps him raise the money by robbing their mother's old boyfriend. Upon his return he learns about Peri's pregnancy and Leela lets him stay for her sake. On Leela and Ziggy's wedding day he kidnaps Leela and she reveals she can never love him for what he's done - unaware that the wedding camera has recorded the whole thing. Cameron eventually lets Leela go, but is blackmailed by Tom who has seen the footage. Cameron convinces Tom to keep quiet as it would destroy Peri if she found out. Cameron starts a relationship with [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) after he helps her rob a house to raise money. He then supports her when her boss [[#Dr. Charles S'avage|Dr. Charles S'avage]] (Andrew Greenough) finds out the truth, but uncovers the truth about him being a fraud and strikes a deal with him: forget what Celine did and he will not tell anybody about his secret. Dr. S'avage agrees and Cameron uses the money he raised from the house to finance a new restaurant after Lockie caused him to lose his job. Tom later blackmails Cameron to stop Peri having their child be adopted, but Cameron refuses to do so. Tom then uploads the video of what Cameron did to the student-teacher messaging board, but changes his mind at the last minute. He forgets to however delete the video and it is accidentally sent by Ste and [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2007)#Harry Thompson|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]). Peri goes into labour after hearing the confession and Cameron, Leela and Tom help her deliver her daughter, [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)#Steph Cunningham-Lomax|Steph]]. Peri then calls the police on Cameron. Leela says she can help him run but Cameron refuses, and apologises to Peri and Celine and tells them he loves them, and asks Tom to look after Peri and Steph before handing himself into the police.\n\nCameron is found not guilty after Leela gives a positive character portrayal to the jury. Tegan, Peri, Ziggy and Ste are furious and disown Leela as they believe she still has feelings for Cameron after everything he has done. In December 2015, Leela and Peri decide to leave the village after Leela discovers that Ziggy and Tegan have feelings for one another. Cameron is furious as he does not know where they have gone and ends his relationship with Celine when she lies that Peri has contacted her. After Leela collects Peri from the village a few weeks later, she tells Cameron that he will never see his daughter again. This results in Cameron confessing to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny on purpose and will kill Leela for keeping him away from Peri. After following Ziggy to Peri and Leela's new flat, he breaks in, turns all the gas on and locks all the doors while Leela is asleep and Peri is out. When Ziggy drops a present off for Peri later, he wakes Leela and she realises that there is a gas leak, so Ziggy breaks the door down and the pair escape as the building explodes; however, Ziggy hits his head as he and Leela are blown away by the explosion. He later dies from his injuries, leaving Tegan heartbroken.\n\nIn 2016, after Ste moves back in with his family, Cameron resents his presence and gets him addicted to [[crystal meth]], which he finds very difficult to overcome. Disgusted by Ste, Leela and Tegan ask him to leave, so he moves in with Harry and his father [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), much to Cameron's delight. It later transpires that Cameron murdered Lockie after he discovered that Cameron caused the explosion that killed Ziggy, and this secret comes under threat by the arrival of his cousin, [[Courtney Campbell (Hollyoaks)|Courtney Campbell]] (Amy Conachan), who is desperate to find out where Lockie is. Cameron continues to lie to those he loves, including telling Courtney that he has already had Lockie cremated. Cameron is furious when he discovers that Peri's best friend, [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) has become obsessed with her and held her hostage, and so at the \"Halloween Spooktacular\" festival, Cameron sets fire to the wooden maze where Nico and her mother, [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) are. The building is engulfed by flames, and Sienna is rescued, despite her pleas for Nico to be saved. Nico is then killed when the entire structure collapses on her, leaving Sienna distraught. Elsewhere, [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) and [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) are trapped on a ferris wheel, and after Mercedes is saved, an explosion caused by the fire started by Cameron sees Joe fall from the ferris wheel, and later dying in hospital. Cameron later discovers that Celine has footage of him setting the maze on fire, but after overhearing Celine confessing to Tegan that she attempted to murder her stepfather [[Pete Buchanan]] ([[Kai Owen]]), Cameron blackmails Celine into keeping quiet.\n\nCameron begins to panic when Celine threatens to confess to the police the truth about the fire. He confronts Celine before luring her into an abandoned shed where he holds Celine hostage. Later, Cameron visits Celine where she begs him to release her, promising that she will keep quiet about the fire and that she can live with the guilt. Cameron visits Celine's boyfriend, [[Jesse Donovan]] (Luke Jerdy), and, believing Jesse to be totally oblivious to the person responsible for causing the fire, returns to Celine with the possible intention of releasing her. However, on the way to the shack, Cameron intercepts a voice message from Jesse to Celine making him realise that Jesse knows more than he was letting on. Cameron confronts Celine and tearfully tells her that he has no other way to keep her silence but to kill her, promising to make it as quick as possible before strangling her to death, and dumping her corpse in the lake. On Cameron's wedding day to Leela, she gives birth prematurely and the baby is placed in an incubator to help him breathe. Leela names the baby [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#Daniel|Daniel]], after her father Danny. Cameron notices a bruise on the baby and verbally attacks the staff, believing them to be abusing Daniel but it transpires to be a [[Mongolian blue spot]], which is common in mixed race babies. Leela then reveals to Cameron that Daniel is not his son. Cameron then gives Leela an ultimatum: him or Daniel. Leela subsequently chooses Daniel, so Cameron leaves.\n\nWeeks later, Cameron returns to the village and convinces Peri to lure Leela to the cabin, so that they can \"reunite\". He also kidnaps [[Zack Loveday]] (Duayne Boachie), believing him to be Daniel's father, unaware that Daniel's biological father is actually [[Louis Loveday]] ([[Karl Collins]]), Zack's father.

Dr. S'avage is [[Dennis Savage]]'s ([[Joe Tracini]]) father, and [[Dirk Savage]]'s ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) brother. Dr. S'avage is estranged from Dennis after leaving him to pursue his medical career and has been billed as pompous, as well as having changed his surname to escape from his roots. Dr. S'avage takes charge of a young team of doctors who include [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]), [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis), [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) and other newcomers. Dr. S'avage's introductory storyline saw him taken hostage by [[Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]).<ref name=\"newoakscastings\" /> Dr. S'avage died during the episode that aired on 20 October when, after discovering the Gloved Hand Killer's identity, he was killed by them. His exit was not announced prior to the episode's airing, making it a surprise for viewers.\n\nDr. S'avage is first mentioned by his son Dennis, and informs his cousin [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton) of how his father left him with Dirk to pursue his medical career at the time, when he was kidnapped by Will. One year later, Dr. S'avage first appears talking to Kim and it is revealed he has recently been hired to work at Dee Valley Hospital. During the hospital siege he tries to stand up to Big Bob when [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) is shot, but he was overpowered. He then promises to help [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) get her job back. It is then revealed that he is the father of Dennis who he left in his brother, Dirk's, care when Dennis was a child so he could work abroad. Dennis and Dr. S'avage have a hard time reconciling, especially when Dr. S'avage disapproves of Dennis' transgender girlfriend [[Blessing Chambers]] ([[Modupe Adeyeye]]). Dr. S'avage then stops Dennis after he threatens to blow up [[Trevor Royle]]'s ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) flat in revenge for Trevor killing his wife, [[Leanne Holiday]] (Jessica Forrest), one year prior.\n\nDr. S'avage then reveals to Tegan that the reason her daughter [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Rose Lomax|Rose]]'s blood transfusion did not work was because  Rose was a different blood type than what Tegan was told at her birth, meaning Rose is not her biological daughter. He then informs Tegan that her cancer treatment has not worked and to [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) that his cancer treatment has made him infertile. After the baby swap dilemma comes to light, the midwife who switched them, [[Mariam Andrews]] ([[Helen Lederer]]), is revealed to be Dr. S'avage's ex-wife. Mariam then blackmails Dr. S'avage into helping her, threatening to reveal a secret of his if he does not. Dr. S'avage then places Mariam in a mental ward which is witnessed by [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]). Sienna then gets close to Mariam to try and uncover his secret, and Dr. S'avage, panicking, promises to get her out. Dr. S'avage is angry at his nephew Will for kidnapping Dennis two years prior, and also supports Dirk when he reveals he is being blackmailed over letting his son Will die, but Dr. S'avage tells him he has nothing to feel guilty about. He also helps him set up traps to catch the blackmailer, who is later revealed to be [[Robbie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Wernham]]).\n\nSienna and Dr. S'avage grow closer over the following weeks, which a newly released Mariam is jealous about so she reveals Dr. S'avage's secret: he never fully qualified as a doctor. This panics Sienna as he is treating her daughter, [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]), who has a kidney infection. Dr. S'avage, however, assures her that he has never miss-diagnosed a patient and that if the truth comes out she may be deemed fit to stand trial and could end up in prison. When Mariam accuses him of killing patients, he denies it and Sienna helps destroy the evidence of him not qualifying as a doctor. When Mariam is found dead in his office after being murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Sienna gives him an alibi. A few weeks later, Dr. S'avage finds Sienna suffering an allergic reaction from a bee sting after Nico abandoned her and encourages Sienna to report Nico to Social Services as she needs help. Sienna agrees but later regrets her decision and has an argument with Dr. S'avage about it, before breaking down in tears. Dr. S'avage comforts her and they share a kiss. Sienna tells him later that she just sees him as a father figure, devastating him. [[Reenie McQueen]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]) then starts flirting with him to get his money, but Dr. S'avage does not believe Sienna when she tells him. After Sienna pushes Reenie down the city stairs, Dr. S'avage helps her cover it up after she admits she needed him by blackmailing Reenie over her using his credit card. He then treats Sienna's wounds after Reenie attacks her and promises to mend her wicker make of the Titanic, which Reenie also destroyed.\n\nIn August 2015, Dr. S'avage discovers that Nico murdered [[Carly Bradley]] (Sophie Wise) while protecting Sienna and tries to cover it up, but the police are called by Celine. He panics when Nico is arrested, but she is later released. He also treats [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) after a car explosion and is seen outside when the Gloved Hand Killer murdered [[Dylan Jenkins]] (James Fletcher), ruling him out as a suspect. He then becomes suspicious of Dylan's death and when [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) finds the Gloved Hand Killer's locker with photos of their victims, she shares what she found with Dr. S'avage. Dr. S'avage then finds a strand of hair in the locker and orders all his staff to take a drug test in an attempt to find out who it is. However, Celine panics as she is using hospital appetite suppressants to get thin and she switches her DNA sample in order to throw the scent off her. Dr. S'avage places a camera in the drugs locker to try and catch the killer, but it fails. Later, when [[Ashley Davidson]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]) is murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Dr. S'avage uses the CCTV camera he placed in Ashley's room and succeedingly catches the killer. But, when advancing into the Hollyoaks Pride Festival, he calls Cindy to tell her who the killer is, unaware that the killer is behind him, armed with a syringe. Dr. S'avage is then injured when he is struck by a falling beam after Trevor shot it down by accident. In the confusion, the killer reaches Dr. S'avage and fatally injects him with a large dose of [[potassium chloride]], which was witnessed by young [[Charlie Dean]] (Charlie Behan). Dr. S'avage descends into [[cardiac arrest]] and is rushed to hospital, but dies when being resuscitated. Dirk is devastated by this as they always argued with each other. However, Cindy is adamant that the Gloved Hand Killer murdered him. Lindsey is later revealed as the killer soon after Dr. S'avage's death.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|name= Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen\n|portrayed= uncredited \n|introduced= Bryan Kirkwood\n|years= 2014\u20132016\n|first= 15 October 2014\n|last= 11 March 2016\n|classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2016|Former; recurring]]\n|home= [[Spain]] (2016\u2013)\n|family= [[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n|father= [[Dodger Savage]] \n|mother= [[Theresa McQueen]] \n|halfsisters= [[Nico Blake]] <br>  [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]]\n|grandfathers= [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] <br> [[William Alexander (Hollyoaks)|William Alexander]]\n| grandmothers= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Anna Blake|Anna Blake]] <br> [[Kathleen McQueen]] \n|uncles= [[Will Savage]]\n|aunts= [[Mercedes McQueen]] <br> [[Jacqui McQueen]] <br> [[Sienna Blake]] <br> [[#Minnie Minniver|Minnie Minniver]]\n|nieces=  [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2018)#Victoria Blake|Victoria Blake]]\n|cousins= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2011)|Bobby Costello]] <br> [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2017)#Sophie Blake|Sophie Blake]]<br>[[Sebastian Blake]]\n|relatives= [[Myra McQueen]] <br> [[Reenie McQueen]] <br> [[Carmel McQueen]] <br> [[John Paul McQueen]] <br> [[#Porsche McQueen|Porsche McQueen]] <br> [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] <br> [[Cleo McQueen]] <br> [[Matthew McQueen]]\n}}\n'''Myra-Pocahontas Regina Madonna Savage-McQueen''' is a daughter of [[Dodger Savage]] ([[Danny Mac]]) and [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) and half-sister of [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]) and [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]] (Nieve Grandison).

Sexual abuse is a crime that rips apart families and I am very pleased with the way that Hollyoaks has thoughtfully approached an enormously emotive and challenging subject. Sexual abuse of children within families is disturbingly the most common form and the impact on victims is devastating, sometimes damaging them long into adulthood if they don't get the right support. Children can stay silent for fear of what speaking out will do to the relationships they have with other members of the family. Abusers may cynically use this fear to keep children silent, leaving them suffering a daily nightmare. Its important children know that help is out there and they can move forward positively.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks''' executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood spoke about how viewers should be aware that [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]) suffered sexual abuse within her family, and how the research that the ''Hollyoaks'' team did found that abuse can in fact infiltrate generations. He continued to speak about what he hopes to achieve: \"Her daughter Reenie is as much the victim here as her daughters in that her own childhood was filled with such unclear boundaries that she is unable to spot the markers that mean her own girls are at risk. But this is not a hopeless story - far from it. It will endeavour to show that we do have the power to stop abuse and most importantly that it is possible to recover and to go on and have a happy and successful life. The campaign 'no secrets' is a simple message that can be used to encourage adults not to ask children to keep secrets and let children know that they shouldn't have secrets either. It is the secrets kept by generations of this family that have led to what we will see play out on screen this year.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> It was then revealed that Nana's ex-partner, [[Derek Clough]] ([[Bruce Montague]]), was her real father as Reenie was raped by him.\n\nPorsche's final scenes were filmed on 12 November 2015, and were broadcast on 24 December 2015.
