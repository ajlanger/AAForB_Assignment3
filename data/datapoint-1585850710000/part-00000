In 2006, the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] presented \"Michael Craig-Martin: Works 1964\u20132006\" which included works from over 40 years of Craig-Martin's career.

One of his works called ''On the Table'' (1970) involved four metal buckets suspended on a table, exemplifying the influence of [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptualism]] on Craig-Martin. ''[[An Oak Tree]]'' (1973), consisting of \"an ordinary glass of water on an equally plain shelf, accompanied by a text in which Craig-Martin asserts the supremacy of the artist's intention over the object itself ... is now widely regarded as a turning point in the development of conceptual art\".<ref>{{citation|title=Michael Craig-Martin at the Irish Museum of Modern Art|publisher=ARTINFO|date=5 October 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/21219/michael-craig-martin-at-the-irish-museum-of-modern-art|accessdate=23 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Craig-Martin's exhibition \"Transience\" at the [[Serpentine Galleries]] brought together works from 1981 to 2015, including representations of once familiar yet obsolete technology;

In 2006, the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] presented \"Michael Craig-Martin: Works 1964\u20132006\" which included works from over 40 years of Craig-Martin's career. The exhibition showed around 50 paintings, sculptures, wall drawings, neon works and text pieces by the artist, covering everything from his sculptures to digital works. One of his works called ''On the Table'' (1970) involved four metal buckets suspended on a table, exemplifying the influence of [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptualism]] on Craig-Martin. ''[[An Oak Tree]]'' (1973), consisting of \"an ordinary glass of water on an equally plain shelf, accompanied by a text in which Craig-Martin asserts the supremacy of the artist's intention over the object itself ... is now widely regarded as a turning point in the development of conceptual art\".<ref>{{citation|title=Michael Craig-Martin at the Irish Museum of Modern Art|publisher=ARTINFO|date=5 October 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/21219/michael-craig-martin-at-the-irish-museum-of-modern-art|accessdate=23 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Craig-Martin's exhibition \"Transience\" at the [[Serpentine Galleries]] brought together works from 1981 to 2015, including representations of once familiar yet obsolete technology;
