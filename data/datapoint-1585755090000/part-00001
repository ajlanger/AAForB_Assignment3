Originally from [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]], [[Western Australia]], he debuted with {{WAFL EP}} in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL) in 2000. After winning the [[Simpson Medal]] as the best player in the grand final in his first season, Cox was recruited to West Coast with the 28th pick in the [[2000 AFL Draft|2001 Rookie Draft]]. He made his senior debut during the [[2001 AFL season|2001 season]], and played in West Coast's 2006 premiership side. A [[Ruckman (Australian rules football)|ruckman]], Cox was named in the [[All-Australian team]] six times, including four seasons consecutively from 2005 to 2008, and was considered the outstanding player in his position throughout much of his career. He won [[John Worsfold|West Coast's best and fairest award]] in 2008, and finished in the top three on four other occasions. Cox retired at the end of the [[2014 AFL season|2014 season]], finishing his career with 290 games, a club record, and 169 goals. \n\n==Early career==\nCox was a naturally gifted sportsman who excelled at sports whilst growing up in [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]], Western Australia. Played for Dampier Sharks.\n\nHis uncle George Michalczyk, a former Australian rules player himself, recommended Cox to the club he began his senior career with, [[East Perth Football Club|East Perth]].\n\nCox played colts for East Perth in 1999 and at the end of the season was invited to train with the West Coast Eagles in their pre-season. He impressed enough for him to be rookie-listed, however he struggled in pre-season training and was criticised for being slightly uncoordinated.\n\nMeanwhile, he played senior football for East Perth. He began the season fifth in the order of an impressive list of ruckmen, but by season's end he had impressed so much he earned a place as the first ruckman in their grand final team and collected a [[Simpson Medal]] for his efforts.\n\nThe Eagles then put him on their senior list and he made his AFL debut in 2001. Initially he showed few signs of his potential at that level. However, he was persisted with.\n\nHe is recognizable by his intimidating 204&nbsp;cm and 107&nbsp;kg frame, ranking among the top 10 tallest players in the AFL at the time of writing.\n\n==2005 season==\nHe came of age during the [[AFL season 2005|2005]] season, where he became a dominant player for the Eagles and is now considered one of their best.\n\nHe topped the year off with a terrific [[AFL Finals Series 2005|finals series]], living up to his high standards. Two incidents stand out in particular for Cox \u2013 one where in the Qualifying Final against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] he took two saving marks in defence to secure the game in the dying moments, where his team got home by less than a goal. Unfortunately, the other moment that stands out had the Eagles on the other end, where in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] three weeks later, again against Sydney, he took a strong mark on the [[half-forward line]] and speared the ball in towards a pack in the dying moments. Unfortunately for the Eagles, [[Leo Barry]] took a saving mark and secured the Swans a victory by less than a goal.\n\n==2006 season==\n\nCox got off to a superb start to the season and was one of the premier players in the competition early. He is still playing well and has established himself as one of the leagues premier ruckmen, averaging over 20 hitouts and almost 20 disposals per game through Round 8 of the 2006 Season. However, in Round 13 he met with a hard bump from Bulldog Adam Cooney, which left him with a broken collar bone. He returned to the side, and was a key figure in the Eagles thrilling 1 point win of Sydney in the [[2006 AFL Grand Final]], running Sydney [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]] [[Stephen Doyle (footballer)|Stephen Doyle]] and [[Darren Jolly]] ragged. Cox played 21 games in 2006, took 141 marks and kicked 14 goals.\n\n==2007\u20132014==\n\nCox played 21 games in 2007 and all 22 in 2008 as the club missed the finals, in what was a turbulent few years. The departure of Ben Cousins and Chris Judd (Carlton) and questions surrounding the clubs culture meant that Cox had to step up. Many thought he would be appointed Captain for 2008, but the position was awarded to Darren Glass. Cox made the All-Australian Team in both of these years, continuing to be the dominant ruckman of the competition despite playing in a struggling side (mostly in 2008). He also did no harm to his reputation as a ruckman/midfielder, collecting 25 disposals or more 5 times in 2007, and 7 times in 2008, and regularly featuring among the best. Standout games included the Semi-Final against Collingwood in 2007 that went to extra time (which West Coast lost), where Cox collected 27 disposals, 9 marks, 29 hitouts and a goal. In Round 10 of 2008 against Collingwood, again an Eagles loss, Cox gathered 30 disposals, 7 marks, 36 hitouts and kicked two goals.\n\nCox finished his career with 6,628 hitouts, an AFL record.<ref>[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players.html#t6 Career Totals and Averages: Hit Outs] \u2013 AFL Tables. Retrieved 31 August 2014.</ref>\n\n==Playing style==\nDean Cox is a very versatile [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]], who tends to cover much ground. Sometimes considered to be the Eagles 'fifth [[midfielder]]', Cox is a modern example of a mobile ruckman. He effectively wins knock-outs and can assist the likes of midfielders [[Daniel Kerr]],  [[Matthew Priddis]] and [[Matt Rosa]]. Cox is widely considered as the premier ruckman of the competition, as seen by his selection in the last four [[All-Australian team]]s.\n\n==Statistics==\n:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/D/Dean_Cox.html|title=Dean Cox|work=AFL Tables|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend/ruckman}}\n{{AFL player statistics start/ruckman}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2001 AFL season|2001]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 17 || 2 || 2 || 62 || 69 || 131 || 38 || 18 || 184 || 0.1 || 0.1 || 3.6 || 4.1 || 7.7 || 2.2 || 1.1 || 10.8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2002 AFL season|2002]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 19 || 7 || 1 || 96 || 97 || 193 || 82 || 17 || 307 || 0.4 || 0.1 || 5.1 || 5.1 || 10.2 || 4.3 || 0.9 || 16.2\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2003 AFL season|2003]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 19 || 10 || 3 || 125 || 88 || 213 || 74 || 12 || 332 || 0.5 || 0.2 || 6.6 || 4.6 || 11.2 || 3.9 || 0.6 || 17.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2004 AFL season|2004]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 23 || 5 || 10 || 172 || 142 || 314 || 117 || 37 || 512 || 0.2 || 0.4 || 7.5 || 6.2 || 13.7 || 5.1 || 1.6 || 22.3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2005 AFL season|2005]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 25 || 22 || 3 || 257 || 152 || 409 || 163 || 29 || 595 || 0.9 || 0.1 || 10.3 || 6.1 || 16.4 || 6.5 || 1.2 || 23.8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2006 AFL season|2006]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 21 || 14 || 9 || 233 || 146 || 379 || 141 || 27 || 449 || 0.7 || 0.4 || 11.1 || 7.0 || 18.0 || 6.7 || 1.3 || 21.4\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2007 AFL season|2007]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 21 || 13 || 9 || 234 || 163 || 397 || 155 || 23 || 449 || 0.6 || 0.4 || 11.1 || 7.8 || 18.9 || 7.4 || 1.1 || 21.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2008 AFL season|2008]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 22 || 9 || 10 || 233 || 253 || 486 || 126 || 34 || 571 || 0.4 || 0.5 || 10.6 || 11.5 || 22.1 || 5.7 || 1.5 || 26.0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2009 AFL season|2009]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 13 || 8 || 7 || 139 || 145 || 284 || 75 || 23 || 346 || 0.6 || 0.5 || 11.2 || 10.7 || 21.8 || 5.8 || 1.8 || 26.6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2010 AFL season|2010]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 22 || 10 || 9 || 178 || 194 || 372 || 91 || 37 || 502 || 0.5 || 0.4 || 8.1 || 8.8 || 16.9 || 4.1 || 1.7 || 22.8\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2011 AFL season|2011]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 25 || 20 || 17 || 270 || 176 || 446 || 137 || 43 || 716 || 0.8 || 0.7|| 10.8 || 7.0 || 17.8  || 5.5 || 1.7 || 28.6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2012 AFL season|2012]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 24 || 28 || 14 || 238 || 147 || 385 || 144 || 39 || 628 || 1.2 || 0.6 || 9.9 || 6.1 || 16.0 || 6.0 || 1.6 || 26.2\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2013 AFL season|2013]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 22 || 13 || 18 || 209 || 140 || 349 || 118 || 52 || 597 || 0.6 || 0.8 || 9.5 || 6.4 || 15.9 || 5.4 || 2.4 || 27.1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2014 AFL season|2014]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 17 || 8 || 6 || 142 || 103 || 245 || 80 || 39 || 405 || 0.5 || 0.4 || 8.4 || 6.1 || 14.4 || 4.7 || 2.3 || 23.8\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 290\n! 169\n! 118\n! 2588\n! 2015\n! 4603\n! 1541\n! 430\n! 6628\n! 0.6\n! 0.4\n! 8.9\n! 7.0\n! 15.9\n! 5.3\n! 1.5\n! 22.9\n|}\n\n==Personal life==\nCox married Kerry Lavell at a ceremony at [[Leeuwin Estate]] in [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]] in December 2011, having dated her for three years previously.<ref>[http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/access-all-areas/12465663/cox-tees-off-before-sw-nuptials/ Cox tees off before SW nuptials] \u2013 ''[[The West Australian]]'' online.

Cox is widely considered as the premier ruckman of the competition, as seen by his selection in the last four [[All-Australian team]]s.\n\n==Statistics==\n:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/D/Dean_Cox.html|title=Dean Cox|work=AFL Tables|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend/ruckman}}\n{{AFL player statistics start/ruckman}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2001 AFL season|2001]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 17 || 2 || 2 || 62 || 69 || 131 || 38 || 18 || 184 || 0.1 || 0.1 || 3.6 || 4.1 || 7.7 || 2.2 || 1.1 || 10.8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2002 AFL season|2002]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 19 || 7 || 1 || 96 || 97 || 193 || 82 || 17 || 307 || 0.4 || 0.1 || 5.1 || 5.1 || 10.2 || 4.3 || 0.9 || 16.2\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2003 AFL season|2003]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 19 || 10 || 3 || 125 || 88 || 213 || 74 || 12 || 332 || 0.5 || 0.2 || 6.6 || 4.6 || 11.2 || 3.9 || 0.6 || 17.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2004 AFL season|2004]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 23 || 5 || 10 || 172 || 142 || 314 || 117 || 37 || 512 || 0.2 || 0.4 || 7.5 || 6.2 || 13.7 || 5.1 || 1.6 || 22.3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2005 AFL season|2005]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 25 || 22 || 3 || 257 || 152 || 409 || 163 || 29 || 595 || 0.9 || 0.1 || 10.3 || 6.1 || 16.4 || 6.5 || 1.2 || 23.8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2006 AFL season|2006]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 21 || 14 || 9 || 233 || 146 || 379 || 141 || 27 || 449 || 0.7 || 0.4 || 11.1 || 7.0 || 18.0 || 6.7 || 1.3 || 21.4\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2007 AFL season|2007]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 21 || 13 || 9 || 234 || 163 || 397 || 155 || 23 || 449 || 0.6 || 0.4 || 11.1 || 7.8 || 18.9 || 7.4 || 1.1 || 21.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2008 AFL season|2008]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 22 || 9 || 10 || 233 || 253 || 486 || 126 || 34 || 571 || 0.4 || 0.5 || 10.6 || 11.5 || 22.1 || 5.7 || 1.5 || 26.0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2009 AFL season|2009]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 13 || 8 || 7 || 139 || 145 || 284 || 75 || 23 || 346 || 0.6 || 0.5 || 11.2 || 10.7 || 21.8 || 5.8 || 1.8 || 26.6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2010 AFL season|2010]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 22 || 10 || 9 || 178 || 194 || 372 || 91 || 37 || 502 || 0.5 || 0.4 || 8.1 || 8.8 || 16.9 || 4.1 || 1.7 || 22.8\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2011 AFL season|2011]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 25 || 20 || 17 || 270 || 176 || 446 || 137 || 43 || 716 || 0.8 || 0.7|| 10.8 || 7.0 || 17.8  || 5.5 || 1.7 || 28.6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2012 AFL season|2012]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 24 || 28 || 14 || 238 || 147 || 385 || 144 || 39 || 628 || 1.2 || 0.6 || 9.9 || 6.1 || 16.0 || 6.0 || 1.6 || 26.2\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2013 AFL season|2013]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 22 || 13 || 18 || 209 || 140 || 349 || 118 || 52 || 597 || 0.6 || 0.8 || 9.5 || 6.4 || 15.9 || 5.4 || 2.4 || 27.1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2014 AFL season|2014]]\n|{{AFL WC}}\n| 20 || 17 || 8 || 6 || 142 || 103 || 245 || 80 || 39 || 405 || 0.5 || 0.4 || 8.4 || 6.1 || 14.4 || 4.7 || 2.3 || 23.8\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 290\n! 169\n! 118\n! 2588\n! 2015\n! 4603\n! 1541\n! 430\n! 6628\n! 0.6\n! 0.4\n! 8.9\n! 7.0\n! 15.9\n! 5.3\n! 1.5\n! 22.9\n|}\n\n==Personal life==\nCox married Kerry Lavell at a ceremony at [[Leeuwin Estate]] in [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]] in December 2011, having dated her for three years previously.<ref>[http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/access-all-areas/12465663/cox-tees-off-before-sw-nuptials/ Cox tees off before SW nuptials] \u2013 ''[[The West Australian]]'' online.
