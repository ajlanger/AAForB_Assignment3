The origins of the liver lie in both the ventral portion of the [[foregut]] [[endoderm]] (endoderm being one of the three embryonic [[germ layer]]s) and the constituents of the adjacent [[septum transversum]] [[mesenchyme]]. In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure.

[[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.

In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

This can lead to scarring ([[fibrosis]]) and [[cirrhosis]]. Cirrhosis increases the resistance to blood flow in the liver, and can result in [[portal hypertension]]. [[Portacaval anastomosis|Congested anastomoses]] between the [[portal venous system]] and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition.\n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied by [[jaundice]] caused by increased levels of [[bilirubin]] in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the [[Haemoglobin|hemoglobin]] of dead [[red blood cell]]s; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.\n\nThere are also many pediatric liver diseases, including [[biliary atresia]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[alagille syndrome]], [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]], [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] and [[cavernous liver haemangioma|hepatic hemangioma]] a [[benign tumour]] the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be congenital. A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n* [[Ascites|Swelling of the abdomen]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the ankles and feet occurs because the [[Hypoalbuminemia|liver fails to make albumin]].\n* Excessive fatigue occurs from a [[Deficiency (medicine)|generalized loss of nutrients]], [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and vitamins.\n* [[bruise|Bruising]] and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. The liver makes [[Coagulation|clotting factors]], substances which help prevent bleeding. When liver damage occurs, these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.<ref>[http://www.ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver Extraintestinal Complications: Liver Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121034708/http://ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver |date=2010-11-21 }} Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

Less commonly, liver transplantation is done for [[fulminant hepatic failure]], in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks.\n\nLiver [[allograft]]s for [[organ transplantation|transplant]] usually come from donors who have died from fatal [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]]. [[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.  Due to the ability of the liver to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well.

The internal structure of the liver is broadly similar in all vertebrates.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 354\u2013355 |isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\nAn organ sometimes referred to as a liver is found associated with the digestive tract of the primitive chordate ''[[Amphioxus]]''.
