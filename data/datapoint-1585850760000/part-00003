F\u00e9lix Gallardo was serving his 37-year sentence at the [[Altiplano prison|Altiplano]] maximum-security prison but was transferred to a medium-security facility in 2014 due to his declining health.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on a ranch in Bellavista, on the outskirts of [[Culiac\u00e1n]], [[Sinaloa]], F\u00e9lix Gallardo graduated from high school and studied business in college. He took a job as a Mexican [[Federal Judicial Police]] agent.<ref>Astorga, Luis (1999); \"Cocaine in Mexico: A Prelude to 'los Narcos{{'\"}} in Gootenberg, Paul (ed.)

As a result, the Colombian cartels began to utilize Mexico as their primary transhipment point.\n\n[[Juan Matta-Ballesteros]] was F\u00e9lix Gallardo's primary connection to the Colombian cartels. Matta-Ballesteros had originally introduced F\u00e9lix Gallardo's predecessor, Alberto Sicilia-Falcon, to Santiago Ocampo of the [[Cali Cartel]], the head of one of the largest U.S. cocaine smuggling rings. Rather than taking cash payments for their services, the smugglers in the Guadalajara cartel took a 50% cut of the cocaine they transported from Colombia. This was extremely profitable for them; some estimate that the trafficking network operated by Felix Gallardo, [[Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo]], and Caro Quintero was pulling in $5 billion annually.<ref name=\"Scott-1998-pp82-85\">{{cite book|author1=Scott, Peter Dale  |author2=Marshall, Jonathan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Cocaine Politics: Drugs, Armies, and the CIA in Latin America|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=9780520921283|pages=82\u201385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgthWZ5KlskC&pg=PA82}}</ref><ref name=\"Last Narco\">{{cite book | last1 = Beith | first1 = Malcolm | title = The Last Narco | publisher = Grove Press | year = 2010 | location = New York, New York | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lastnarcoinsideh00beit/page/40 40\u201355] | isbn = 978-0-8021-1952-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/lastnarcoinsideh00beit/page/40 }}</ref><ref name=\"Whiteout-349\" /><ref>{{cite book|author=Marcy, William|title=The Politics of Cocaine: How U.
