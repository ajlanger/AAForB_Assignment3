He started his career at the age of 17 on the Carolina [[independent circuit]] wrestling both under his real name and as \"Crusher Gray.\" He then moved on to wrestle in the Kentucky/Tennessee area, including for [[International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW), under the [[ring name]] Crusher Broomfield. Gray went in as part of a package along with Bragg, Westbrooks, and Ric Starr. One of Broomfield's major angles was that his contract was owned by ICW Champion [[Randy Savage]] and Savage's nemesis [[Ron Garvin]] defeated Savage in a match to set Broomfield free.<ref name=FieldGuide>{{cite book|last=Pope |first=Kristian |title=Tuff Stuff - Professional wrestling field guide |year=2005 |publisher=KP Books |chapter=One Man Gang (1970s-2000s) |pages=336 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-267-0}}</ref> He later worked for several [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated promotions, [[Mid-South Wrestling]], and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as One Man Gang, billed as being from [[Chicago]]'s Halsted Street on the South Side.<ref name=FieldGuide/> He was managed by [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[Theodore Long]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Sir [[Oliver Humperdink]] in various territories.\n\n===Various territories (1983\u20131986)===\nGang worked for many territories during this time for three years. His biggest success was in [[Championship Wrestling From Florida|Florida]] where he had a feud with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] from 1983 to 1984. Also he feuded with [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Mike Rotunda]]. He teamed up with [[Ron Bass]] and won the [[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|tag team titles]] defeating Rhodes and [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]]. Two months alter they dropped the titles to Rotunda and Davis. In November 1984 as Panama Gang, he became the last [[NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Florida version)]] defeating Mulligan. Later the title was abandoned when Gang left the territory in 1985.\n\nThen Gang worked for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] from 1983 to 1984 and 1986 feuding with [[Giant Baba]], [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Jumbo Tsuruta]]. He temaed with [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Killer Tim Brooks]] and [[Stan Hansen]]. In 1984 he teamed with Goro Tsurumi. Then in 1986 he teamed with [[Jerry Blackwell]], [[Harley Race]] an [[Tiger Jeet Singh]].\n\nDuring these years he also worked in Canada, Central States and Texas.\n\n===World Class Championship Wrestling (1985\u20131986)===\nIn the regional territories, he was a member of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s \"Devastation Inc.\" as well as working with [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). He would feud with [[Von Erich family|The Von Erichs]] teaming with [[Rick Rude]].

Making his debut in the territory by interfering in matches and assaulting the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], Mid-South announcer [[Bill Watts]] would say about the then-unnamed assailant \"He's a one-man gang!\".<ref name=FieldGuide/> The Gang worked on-and-off in Mid-South in between tours of [[Florida]], [[Toronto]], [[Japan]], and [[Texas]]. He would also return to his hometown territory, the Carolinas, to work for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where he was initially billed as \"The One Man Gang, George Gray.\" He worked in Texas All Star wrestling where he feuded with Big Bubba. It was on his last tour for Mid-South when the promotion renamed itself the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], with Gang one of its top [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], feuding at the main-event level with UWF top fan favorite [[Jim Duggan]]. In late 1986, Gang won the UWF Heavyweight Championship in an angle where the champion [[Terry Gordy]] was injured earlier in the evening by a revenge-minded [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Gang, scheduled to face Gordy later on the card, was awarded the belt via forfeit. He held that title for six months, mostly facing Duggan, Williams, and [[Ted DiBiase]].<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\nIn May 1987, Gray began receiving enquiries from the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] about coming up to wrestle for them. He promptly agreed to terms, but returned to the UWF in order to drop the title to [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bubba Rogers]], who was there from his normal place in the NWA due to the recent sale of the UWF to [[Jim Crockett]].<ref name=UWFWorld/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n\n====One Man Gang (1987\u20131988)====\nGray made his debut in the WWF on May 12, 1987, being managed by [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], in a match against Jesse Cortez. He spent much of his early WWF run defeating enhancement talent in extremely short matches in order to build him up, most notably in a match where he [[Suplex#Inverted suplex slam|Gourdbustered]] his opponent after the bell and then did the same to the referee, thus being ([[kayfabe]]) fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 for his actions. While the Gang often defeated enhancement talent and other lower card wrestlers with ease, he was often on the end of defeat when main eventing against bigger stars such as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]], although Gang was a major part of the angle regarding [[Superstar Billy Graham|Billy Graham]] being forced into retirement.<ref name=FieldGuide/> One Man Gang participated in the first ever [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] [[pay-per-view]] as a member of [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]'s team, fighting a team led by Hulk Hogan.

Ware]], and [[Don Muraco]].\n\n====Akeem and Twin Towers (1988\u20131990)====\nIn September 1988, One Man Gang's manager, Slick, announced that Gang was actually [[Africa]]n and planned to re-embrace his roots. An episode of ''WWF Superstars'', which aired on September 24, 1988, featured a vignette with [[Gene Okerlund]] on-location in an American ghetto that was dubbed \"The Deepest Darkest Parts Of Africa,\" where dancers dressed as tribal Africans danced and chanted around a fire; Slick then announced that Gang would be known by his new name, \"Akeem, the African Dream\", though Okerlund immediately called him out as the One Man Gang. This vignette received some criticism, as the Caucasian \"Akeem\" delivered a promo in which he spoke with an extremely stereotypical \"jive\" black accent and danced in the style of [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] while an African ritual took place in the background.<ref name=WrestleCrap>{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first=R.

Though the Twin Towers never held the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], they did feud heavily with WWF World Tag Team champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] at house shows while also feuding with the Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and undisputed [[WWE World Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]]) and throughout the summer and fall of 1988, with the Twin Towers and Slick advertising title match that night against Demolition while on [[Arsenio Hall]]'s [[Arsenio Hall Show|talk show]]. They were also strongly involved in the storyline which would eventually cause Randy Savage to become a villain and defend his title against Hulk Hogan at [[WrestleMania V]].<ref name=WM5>{{cite news|title=2008 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards: WrestleMania V| publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2008|page=116}}</ref> In the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|Royal Rumble]], Randy Savage was accidentally eliminated by teammate Hogan, allowing both Akeem and Bossman to double team Hogan and eliminate him. ''The Main Event'' show broadcast live on [[NBC]] on February 3, 1989 featured The Mega Powers vs. The Twin Towers. During the match, Savage's manager (and real life wife) [[Miss Elizabeth]] was injured after Savage was thrown through the ropes and knocked her to the ground, which led Hogan to abandon his partner and carry Elizabeth back to the locker room for medical help. Although Hogan later returned to the match to help Savage defeat Akeem and Boss Man, Hogan's actions with Elizabeth caused Savage to attack him backstage, setting up the headline match for WrestleMania.<ref name=Hulk80s>{{cite book |last=Shields |first=Brian |title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s |publisher=Pocket Books |year=2006 |edition=4th |chapter=Superstar Bios: Hulk Hogan |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/37 37\u201339] |isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria |url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/37 }}</ref> The Twin Towers went on to face The Rockers at WrestleMania V and defeated them when Akeem pinned [[Shawn Michaels]] with a diving [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Air Africa]] after a [[powerbomb]] from the Big Boss Man.<ref name=WM5/>\n\nIn early 1990, Big Boss Man became upset with Slick always trying to take the credit for him (as well as refusing to be part of a payoff from Ted DiBiase to get DiBiase's \"[[WWE Million Dollar Championship|Million Dollar Championship]]\" belt back from [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]]) and turned on both his manager and his partner Akeem.

He started his career at the age of 17 on the Carolina [[independent circuit]] wrestling both under his real name and as \"Crusher Gray.\" He then moved on to wrestle in the Kentucky/Tennessee area, including for [[International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW), under the [[ring name]] Crusher Broomfield. Gray went in as part of a package along with Bragg, Westbrooks, and Ric Starr. One of Broomfield's major angles was that his contract was owned by ICW Champion [[Randy Savage]] and Savage's nemesis [[Ron Garvin]] defeated Savage in a match to set Broomfield free.<ref name=FieldGuide>{{cite book|last=Pope |first=Kristian |title=Tuff Stuff - Professional wrestling field guide |year=2005 |publisher=KP Books |chapter=One Man Gang (1970s-2000s) |pages=336 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-267-0}}</ref> He later worked for several [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated promotions, [[Mid-South Wrestling]], and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as One Man Gang, billed as being from [[Chicago]]'s Halsted Street on the South Side.<ref name=FieldGuide/> He was managed by [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[Theodore Long]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Sir [[Oliver Humperdink]] in various territories.\n\n===Various territories (1983\u20131986)===\nGang worked for many territories during this time for three years. His biggest success was in [[Championship Wrestling From Florida|Florida]] where he had a feud with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] from 1983 to 1984. Also he feuded with [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Mike Rotunda]]. He teamed up with [[Ron Bass]] and won the [[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|tag team titles]] defeating Rhodes and [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]]. Two months alter they dropped the titles to Rotunda and Davis. In November 1984 as Panama Gang, he became the last [[NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Florida version)]] defeating Mulligan. Later the title was abandoned when Gang left the territory in 1985.\n\nThen Gang worked for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] from 1983 to 1984 and 1986 feuding with [[Giant Baba]], [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Jumbo Tsuruta]]. He temaed with [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Killer Tim Brooks]] and [[Stan Hansen]]. In 1984 he teamed with Goro Tsurumi. Then in 1986 he teamed with [[Jerry Blackwell]], [[Harley Race]] an [[Tiger Jeet Singh]].\n\nDuring these years he also worked in Canada, Central States and Texas.\n\n===World Class Championship Wrestling (1985\u20131986)===\nIn the regional territories, he was a member of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s \"Devastation Inc.\" as well as working with [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). He would feud with [[Von Erich family|The Von Erichs]] teaming with [[Rick Rude]]. Also he feuded in singles competition against [[Kerry Von Erich]], [[King Parsons]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], and [[Bruiser Brody]].\n\nOn May 5, 1985 he lost to Kerry Von Erich in a hair vs hair match at the [[2nd Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions]] where he started sporting a mohawk. He lost to Bruiser Brody in a chain match at Christmas Star Wars 1985. Also lost to Brody again on two occasions a in a steel cage match on January 26 and 27, 1986.\n\n===Mid-South (1982\u20131983, 1985\u20131987)===\nIt was as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Akbar's in the Mid-South territory where Gray would get the name that would stick with him the rest of his career. Making his debut in the territory by interfering in matches and assaulting the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], Mid-South announcer [[Bill Watts]] would say about the then-unnamed assailant \"He's a one-man gang!\".<ref name=FieldGuide/> The Gang worked on-and-off in Mid-South in between tours of [[Florida]], [[Toronto]], [[Japan]], and [[Texas]]. He would also return to his hometown territory, the Carolinas, to work for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where he was initially billed as \"The One Man Gang, George Gray.\" He worked in Texas All Star wrestling where he feuded with Big Bubba. It was on his last tour for Mid-South when the promotion renamed itself the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], with Gang one of its top [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], feuding at the main-event level with UWF top fan favorite [[Jim Duggan]]. In late 1986, Gang won the UWF Heavyweight Championship in an angle where the champion [[Terry Gordy]] was injured earlier in the evening by a revenge-minded [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Gang, scheduled to face Gordy later on the card, was awarded the belt via forfeit. He held that title for six months, mostly facing Duggan, Williams, and [[Ted DiBiase]].<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\nIn May 1987, Gray began receiving enquiries from the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] about coming up to wrestle for them. He promptly agreed to terms, but returned to the UWF in order to drop the title to [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bubba Rogers]], who was there from his normal place in the NWA due to the recent sale of the UWF to [[Jim Crockett]].<ref name=UWFWorld/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n\n====One Man Gang (1987\u20131988)====\nGray made his debut in the WWF on May 12, 1987, being managed by [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], in a match against Jesse Cortez. He spent much of his early WWF run defeating enhancement talent in extremely short matches in order to build him up, most notably in a match where he [[Suplex#Inverted suplex slam|Gourdbustered]] his opponent after the bell and then did the same to the referee, thus being ([[kayfabe]]) fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 for his actions. While the Gang often defeated enhancement talent and other lower card wrestlers with ease, he was often on the end of defeat when main eventing against bigger stars such as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]], although Gang was a major part of the angle regarding [[Superstar Billy Graham|Billy Graham]] being forced into retirement.<ref name=FieldGuide/> One Man Gang participated in the first ever [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] [[pay-per-view]] as a member of [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]'s team, fighting a team led by Hulk Hogan.

Ware]], and [[Don Muraco]].\n\n====Akeem and Twin Towers (1988\u20131990)====\nIn September 1988, One Man Gang's manager, Slick, announced that Gang was actually [[Africa]]n and planned to re-embrace his roots. An episode of ''WWF Superstars'', which aired on September 24, 1988, featured a vignette with [[Gene Okerlund]] on-location in an American ghetto that was dubbed \"The Deepest Darkest Parts Of Africa,\" where dancers dressed as tribal Africans danced and chanted around a fire; Slick then announced that Gang would be known by his new name, \"Akeem, the African Dream\", though Okerlund immediately called him out as the One Man Gang.  This vignette received some criticism, as the Caucasian \"Akeem\" delivered a promo in which he spoke with an extremely stereotypical \"jive\" black accent and danced in the style of [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] while an African ritual took place in the background.<ref name=WrestleCrap>{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first=R.

During the match, Savage's manager (and real life wife) [[Miss Elizabeth]] was injured after Savage was thrown through the ropes and knocked her to the ground, which led Hogan to abandon his partner and carry Elizabeth back to the locker room for medical help. Although Hogan later returned to the match to help Savage defeat Akeem and Boss Man, Hogan's actions with Elizabeth caused Savage to attack him backstage, setting up the headline match for WrestleMania.<ref name=Hulk80s>{{cite book |last=Shields |first=Brian |title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s |publisher=Pocket Books |year=2006 |edition=4th |chapter=Superstar Bios: Hulk Hogan |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/37 37\u201339] |isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria |url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/37 }}</ref> The Twin Towers went on to face The Rockers at WrestleMania V and defeated them when Akeem pinned [[Shawn Michaels]] with a diving [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Air Africa]] after a [[powerbomb]] from the Big Boss Man.<ref name=WM5/>\n\nIn early 1990, Big Boss Man became upset with Slick always trying to take the credit for him (as well as refusing to be part of a payoff from Ted DiBiase to get DiBiase's \"[[WWE Million Dollar Championship|Million Dollar Championship]]\" belt back from [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]]) and turned on both his manager and his partner Akeem.

Gang would take a hiatus from wrestling for the next few years.\n\nGang returned to WCW in the fall of 1995, making his first appearance on the November 16 taping of ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' when he defeated Scott Turner (the match aired December 2). His televised return came at the [[World War 3 (1995)|WCW World War 3]] PPV on November 19, where he was the last person to be eliminated in the three ring, sixty man battle royal.
