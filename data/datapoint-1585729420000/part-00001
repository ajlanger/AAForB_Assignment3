His doctoral thesis, under the supervision of [[Florestan Fernandes]], examined the institution of slavery in Southern Brazil, critiquing, from a Marxist perspective, the dominant approach of [[Gilberto Freyre]] to the topic. It has since become a classic on the subject. Cardoso has also received the Livre-Doc\u00eancia degree in 1963, the most senior level of academic recognition in Brazil, also from Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo.

As senator, Cardoso took part in the 1987\u20131988 National Constituent Assembly that drafted and approved Brazil's current Constitution in the wake of the country's re-democratization. In the early stages of the Constituent Assembly's work (from February to March 1987), Cardoso led the committee that drafted the internal rules of procedure, including the procedural rules governing the drafting of the Constitution itself. These rules of procedure were adopted by the Assembly and published on March 25, 1987. Until 1992, Cardoso served as Leader of the PSDB in the Senate. From October 1992 to May 1993, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President [[Itamar Franco]] (PMDB).\n\nFrom May 1993 to April 1994, he was Minister of Finance and resigned in April 1994 to launch a presidential campaign. In the [[1994 Brazilian general election|October 3 election]], he won the presidency in the first round of voting with 54% of the vote, more than twice that of his nearest opponent, [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]]. This is still the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a free election in Brazilian history. After the constitution was amended to allow a president to succeed himself, he won a second term almost as easily in [[1998 Brazilian general election|1998]], taking 53% to Lula's 31.7% to win in a single round. To date, he is the only president to win an outright majority of the popular vote, and the only one to win the presidency in a single round since popular elections were reinstated in 1989.\n\nCardoso was succeeded in 2003 by Lula da Silva, who ran for the fourth time and had come in second on prior attempts. Lula won in the runoff election against the Cardoso-supported candidate, [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]]. Lula's election has been interpreted as resulting from Cardoso's low approval ratings in his second term.\n\n==Presidency (1995-2002) ==\n[[File:Geneva Ministerial Conference 18-20 May 1998 (9305962437).jpg|thumb|Cardoso with [[Nelson Mandela]] at the 2nd [[Ministerial Conference|World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, May 18, 1998]]\n[[File:Fernando Henrique Cardoso com George W.

Brazil's largest party, the centrist Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), joined Cardoso's governing coalition after the election, as did the right-wing [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|PPB]], the Brazilian Progressive Party, in 1996.\n\nParty loyalty was not always strong, and coalition members did not always vote with the government. Cardoso had difficulty at times gaining support for some of his legislative priorities, even though his coalition  held an overwhelming majority of the congressional seats. Nevertheless, many constitutional amendments were passed during his presidency.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}\n\nHis presidency saw institutional advancements in of human rights, beginning with a national secretariat and a new government programme, discussed with the civil society, to address the issue. On January 8, 1996, he issued his controversial [[Decree 1775]], which created a framework for the clear demarcation of indigenous reservations, but which, as part of the process, opened [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] territories to counterclaims by adjacent landowners. In 2000, Cardoso demanded the disclosure of some classified military files concerning [[Operation Condor]], a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents.<ref name=\"Huma\">{{cite news | url=http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article478.html | title=Latin America in the 1970s: \"Operation Condor\", an International Organization for Kidnapping Opponents | work=l\u2019Humanit\u00e9 in English | date=January 1, 2007 | accessdate=November 12, 2014 | author=Devienne, G\u00e9rard}}</ref>\n\nFHC was the first Brazilian President to address the inequality and the enormous gap between rich and poor.

During his first term, several government-owned enterprises in areas such as steel milling, telecommunications and mining, such as  ''[[Telebras]]'' and ''[[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]]'' were sold to the private sector, the deepest denationalisation in Brazilian history, amidst a polarized political debate between \"neoliberals\" and \"developmentalists\". Ironically, this time Cardoso was against the latter group, generating uproar among former academic colleagues and political allies who accused him of reneging his previous intellectual work.

Economists aligned with his government argued that this was due to external factors outside the control of the administration at the time, such as the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the growth of the share of the debt denominated in US dollars.<ref>{{cite web | title=Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability: Cardoso's Brazil, 1995-2002 \n| publisher=International Monetary Fund \n|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp04156.pdf | date=August 2004 \n| accessdate=November 12, 2014 |author1=Giambiagi, Fabio \n|author2=Ronci, Marcio \n}}\n</ref> Nevertheless, [[devaluation]] of the currency was an instrument of [[monetary policy]] used right after his reelection, when the real pegged to the dollar led to a financial crisis that saw the country lose much of its foreign reserve fund and raise its interest rates on government bonds to very high levels as he tried to stabilize the currency under a new free-floating regime. With this economic shift, the greatest achievement of Cardoso - his landmark lowering of [[inflation]] - was maintained, but his popularity plummeted.\n\nGiven his previous experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs and his prestige as an internationally famous sociologist, he was respected on the world scene, building friendships with such leaders as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Although he was respected abroad, in Brazil he had problems gaining support in Congress for government priorities and among people in general. As a result, major reforms planned by the [[executive branch]], such as changes in the tax system and to [[social security]], were only partially approved and only after long discussion. Although he claiming to still support [[social democracy]], his economic policies led people on the left to identify him with [[neoliberalism]] and [[right-wing politics]], terms that often carry a [[Pink tide|very negative connotation]] in Latin American political debate and academic circles.\n\n[[File:Viagens presidenciais de Fernando Henrique Cardoso.png|thumb|Foreign trips of Cardoso during his presidency.]]\nHe also experienced personal problems with former ally [[Itamar Franco]], his predecessor and later became Governor of [[Minas Gerais]], a fierce opponent of his administrative reforms that saw the state lose its capacity to contract debt and forced a reduction of local government spending. Cardoso was also criticized for amending the constitution to his own benefit, allowing him to stay eight years in office. His popularity in his first four years, gained with the success of [[Plano Real]], decreased during his last four years as the currency crisis was followed by lower economic growth and employment rates, greater public debt, growing political dissent, low levels of investment in appropriate infrastructure, and, finally, an energy crisis caused by an unexpected drought, as over 80% of Brazil's electricity is hydroelectric. He publicly admitted that he could have done more for [[public security]] and for the creation of new jobs, but defended his policies in areas such as health and education.\n\nCardoso's administration was accused of bribing congressmen to pass a constitutional amendment that secured FHC the right to seek a reelection, which he eventually won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/05/22/2-brazilians-quit-congress-in-bribe-probe/86d23950-50f9-4ff5-8ad4-25d2a34b8b66/|title=2 BRAZILIANS QUIT CONGRESS IN BRIBE PROBE|first=Peter|last=Muello|date=22 May 1997|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\n==Post-presidency==\n[[File:FHC, Collor e Sarney.jpg|thumb|left|Former Presidents (from right), [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney|Sarney]], [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Collor]] and Cardoso, April 2008]]\nAfter stepping down from office, he assumed a position as a senior leader of his party and leading public voice in the opposition to the incumbent [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], writing extensively on Brazilian politics for newspapers and giving lectures and interviews.

As senator, Cardoso took part in the 1987\u20131988 National Constituent Assembly that drafted and approved Brazil's current Constitution in the wake of the country's re-democratization. In the early stages of the Constituent Assembly's work (from February to March 1987), Cardoso led the committee that drafted the internal rules of procedure, including the procedural rules governing the drafting of the Constitution itself. These rules of procedure were adopted by the Assembly and published on March 25, 1987. Until 1992, Cardoso served as Leader of the PSDB in the Senate. From October 1992 to May 1993, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President [[Itamar Franco]] (PMDB).\n\nFrom May 1993 to April 1994, he was Minister of Finance and resigned in April 1994 to launch a presidential campaign. In the [[1994 Brazilian general election|October 3 election]], he won the presidency in the first round of voting with 54% of the vote, more than twice that of his nearest opponent, [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]]. This is still the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a free election in Brazilian history. After the constitution was amended to allow a president to succeed himself, he won a second term almost as easily in [[1998 Brazilian general election|1998]], taking 53% to Lula's 31.7% to win in a single round. To date, he is the only president to win an outright majority of the popular vote, and the only one to win the presidency in a single round since popular elections were reinstated in 1989.\n\nCardoso was succeeded in 2003 by Lula da Silva, who ran for the fourth time and had come in second on prior attempts. Lula won in the runoff election against the Cardoso-supported candidate, [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]]. Lula's election has been interpreted as resulting from Cardoso's low approval ratings in his second term.\n\n==Presidency (1995-2002) ==\n[[File:Geneva Ministerial Conference 18-20 May 1998 (9305962437).jpg|thumb|Cardoso with [[Nelson Mandela]] at the 2nd [[Ministerial Conference|World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, May 18, 1998]]\n[[File:Fernando Henrique Cardoso com George W.

Brazil's largest party, the centrist Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), joined Cardoso's governing coalition after the election, as did the right-wing [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|PPB]], the Brazilian Progressive Party, in 1996.\n\nParty loyalty was not always strong, and coalition members did not always vote with the government. Cardoso had difficulty at times gaining support for some of his legislative priorities, even though his coalition  held an overwhelming majority of the congressional seats. Nevertheless, many constitutional amendments were passed during his presidency.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}\n\nHis presidency saw institutional advancements in of human rights, beginning with a national secretariat and a new government programme, discussed with the civil society, to address the issue. On January 8, 1996, he issued his controversial [[Decree 1775]], which created a framework for the clear demarcation of indigenous reservations, but which, as part of the process, opened [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] territories to counterclaims by adjacent landowners. In 2000, Cardoso demanded the disclosure of some classified military files concerning [[Operation Condor]], a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents.<ref name=\"Huma\">{{cite news | url=http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article478.html | title=Latin America in the 1970s: \"Operation Condor\", an International Organization for Kidnapping Opponents | work=l\u2019Humanit\u00e9 in English | date=January 1, 2007 | accessdate=November 12, 2014 | author=Devienne, G\u00e9rard}}</ref>\n\nFHC was the first Brazilian President to address the inequality and the enormous gap between rich and poor.

During his first term, several government-owned enterprises in areas such as steel milling, telecommunications and mining, such as  ''[[Telebras]]'' and ''[[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]]'' were sold to the private sector, the deepest denationalisation in Brazilian history, amidst a polarized political debate between \"neoliberals\" and \"developmentalists\". Ironically, this time Cardoso was against the latter group, generating uproar among former academic colleagues and political allies who accused him of reneging his previous intellectual work. Economists still contend over its long-term effects; some research suggests that companies sold by the government achieved better profitability as a result of their disengagement from the state.<ref name=\"revistabras-economia\">{{cite journal | title=Os efeitos da privatiza\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o desempenho econ\u00f4mico e financeiro das empresas privatizadas |author1=Anuatti-Neto, Francisco |author2=Barossi-Filho, Milton |author3=Carvalho, Antonio Gledson de |author4=Macedo, Roberto | journal=Revista Brasileira de Economia |date=April\u2013June 2005 | volume=59 | issue=2 | pages=151\u2013175 | issn=0034-7140|language=Portuguese | doi=10.1590/s0034-71402005000200001}}</ref>\n[[File:Inauguration of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2003.jpeg|thumb|right|Outgoing president Cardoso, with his wife [[Ruth Cardoso|Ruth]] (right), at the [[Brazilian presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] on January 1, 2003.]]\nDespite the sale of public assets, the years 1995 to 2002 saw a rise of the total public debt from 30%  to 55.5% of [[GDP]]. Economists aligned with his government argued that this was due to external factors outside the control of the administration at the time, such as the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the growth of the share of the debt denominated in US dollars.<ref>{{cite web | title=Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability: Cardoso's Brazil, 1995-2002 \n| publisher=International Monetary Fund \n|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp04156.pdf | date=August 2004 \n| accessdate=November 12, 2014 |author1=Giambiagi, Fabio \n|author2=Ronci, Marcio \n}}\n</ref> Nevertheless, [[devaluation]] of the currency was an instrument of [[monetary policy]] used right after his reelection, when the real pegged to the dollar led to a financial crisis that saw the country lose much of its foreign reserve fund and raise its interest rates on government bonds to very high levels as he tried to stabilize the currency under a new free-floating regime. With this economic shift, the greatest achievement of Cardoso - his landmark lowering of [[inflation]] - was maintained, but his popularity plummeted.\n\nGiven his previous experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs and his prestige as an internationally famous sociologist, he was respected on the world scene, building friendships with such leaders as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Although he was respected abroad, in Brazil he had problems gaining support in Congress for government priorities and among people in general. As a result, major reforms planned by the [[executive branch]], such as changes in the tax system and to [[social security]], were only partially approved and only after long discussion. Although he claiming to still support [[social democracy]], his economic policies led people on the left to identify him with [[neoliberalism]] and [[right-wing politics]], terms that often carry a [[Pink tide|very negative connotation]] in Latin American political debate and academic circles.\n\n[[File:Viagens presidenciais de Fernando Henrique Cardoso.png|thumb|Foreign trips of Cardoso during his presidency.]]\nHe also experienced personal problems with former ally [[Itamar Franco]], his predecessor and later became Governor of [[Minas Gerais]], a fierce opponent of his administrative reforms that saw the state lose its capacity to contract debt and forced a reduction of local government spending. Cardoso was also criticized for amending the constitution to his own benefit, allowing him to stay eight years in office. His popularity in his first four years, gained with the success of [[Plano Real]], decreased during his last four years as the currency crisis was followed by lower economic growth and employment rates, greater public debt, growing political dissent, low levels of investment in appropriate infrastructure, and, finally, an energy crisis caused by an unexpected draught, as over 80% of Brazil's electricity is hydroelectric. He publicly admitted that he could have done more for [[public security]] and for the creation of new jobs, but defended his policies in areas such as health and education.\n\nCardoso's administration was accused of bribing congressmen to pass a constitutional amendment that secured FHC the right to seek a reelection, which he eventually won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/05/22/2-brazilians-quit-congress-in-bribe-probe/86d23950-50f9-4ff5-8ad4-25d2a34b8b66/|title=2 BRAZILIANS QUIT CONGRESS IN BRIBE PROBE|first=Peter|last=Muello|date=22 May 1997|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\n==Post-presidency==\n[[File:FHC, Collor e Sarney.jpg|thumb|left|Former Presidents (from right), [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney|Sarney]], [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Collor]] and Cardoso, April 2008]]\nAfter stepping down from office, he assumed a position as a senior leader of his party and leading public voice in the opposition to the incumbent [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], writing extensively on Brazilian politics for newspapers and giving lectures and interviews.
