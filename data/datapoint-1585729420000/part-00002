Otherwise, it would be impossible to distinguish 'punishment' from 'revenge'. People in authority can, of course, inflict pain on people at whim. But this would be called 'spite' unless it were inflicted as a consequence of a breach of rules on the part of the sufferer. Similarly a person in authority might give a person \u00a35 as a consequence of his breaking a rule. But unless this were regarded as painful or at least unpleasant for the recipient it could not be counted as a case of 'punishment'. In other words at least three criteria of (i) intentional infliction of pain (ii) by someone in authority (iii) on a person as a consequence of a breach of rules on his part, must be satisfied if we are to call something a case of 'punishment'. There are, as is usual in such cases, examples that can be produced which do not satisfy all criteria. For instance there is a colloquialism which is used about boxers taking a lot of punishment from their opponents, in which only the first condition is present. But this is a metaphorical use which is peripheral to the central use of the term.<br /><br />In so far as the different 'theories' of punishment are answers to questions about the meaning of 'punishment', only the retributive theory is a possible one. There is no conceptual connection between 'punishment' and notions like those of 'deterrence', 'prevention' and 'reform'. For people can be punished without being prevented from repeating the offence, and without being made any better. It is also a further question whether they themselves or anyone else is deterred from committing the offence by punishment.

During a period of heavy fishing and tourism that encroached on their territory, they started to live in groups, learning from each other, especially hunting techniques.  Small, younger octopuses could be near the fully grown octopuses without being eaten by them, even though they, like other Octopus vulgaris, were [[cannibalism|cannibals]] until just before the group formation.{{Citation needed|reason=The source paper is missing and can not be found with a cursory google search|date=February 2017}} The authors stress that this behavior change happened too fast to be a genetic characteristic in the octopuses, and that there were certainly no mammals or other \"naturally\" social animals punishing octopuses for cannibalism involved. The authors also note that the octopuses adopted [[observational learning]] without any [[evolution]]ary history of specialized adaptation for it.<ref>\"Observational Learning in Octopus vulgaris.\" Graziano Fiorito, Pietro Scotto. 1992.</ref><ref>Aliens of the deep sea, documentary. 2011.</ref>\n\nThere are also arguments against the notion of punishment requiring intelligence, based on studies of punishment in very small-brained animals such as [[insect]]s. There is proof of [[honey bee]] workers with mutations that makes them fertile laying eggs only when other honey bees are not observing them, and that the few that are caught in the act are killed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This is corroborated by [[computer simulation]]s proving that a few simple reactions well within mainstream views of the extremely limited intelligence of insects are sufficient to emulate the \"political\" behavior observed in [[great ape]]s. The authors argue that this [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the claim that punishment evolved as a strategy to deal with individuals capable of knowing what they are doing.<ref>''How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence'', Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard, foreword by Rodney Brooks. 2006</ref>\n\nIn the case of more complex brains, the notion of evolution selecting for specific punishment of intentionally chosen breaches of rules and/or wrongdoers capable of intentional choices (for example, punishing [[human]]s for murder while not punishing lethal [[virus]]es) is subject to criticism from [[coevolution]] issues. That punishment of individuals with certain characteristics (including but, in principle, not restricted to mental abilities) selects against those characteristics, making evolution of any mental abilities considered to be the basis for penal responsibility impossible in populations subject to such selective punishment. Certain scientists argue that this disproves the notion of humans having a biological feeling of intentional transgressions deserving to be punished.<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1886).

[[Criminal]]s are punished judicially, by [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[corporal punishment]] or [[custodial sentence]]s such as [[prison]]; detainees risk further punishments for breaches of internal rules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyman Julius Nash|first=Wisconsin|date=1919|title=Wisconsin Statutes|url=|journal=Legislative Reference Bureau, 1919|volume=1|pages=2807\u20132808|via=}}</ref> [[Child]]ren, pupils and other trainees may be punished by their educators or instructors (mainly [[parent]]s, [[legal guardian|guardians]], or [[teacher]]s, tutors and [[coach (sport)|coaches]]) \u2013 see [[Child discipline]].\n\n[[Slaves]], domestic and other servants are subject to punishment by their [[Slave master|masters]]. Employees can still be subject to a contractual form of fine or [[demotion]]. Most hierarchical organizations, such as military and police forces, or even churches, still apply quite rigid internal discipline, even with a judicial system of their own ([[court martial]], [[canonical court]]s).\n\nPunishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in [[penance]] (which is voluntary) or imposed in a [[theocracy]] with a religious police (as in a strict [[Islamic state]] like [[Iran]] or under the [[Taliban]]) or (though not a true theocracy) by [[Inquisition]].\n\n==Hell as punishment==\nBelief that an individual's ultimate punishment is being sent by God, the highest authority, to an existence in Hell, a place believed to exist in the after-life, typically corresponds to [[sin]]s committed during their life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Christianity|damned souls]] suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.\n\nIn many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is traditionally depicted as fiery and painful, inflicting guilt and suffering.<ref>Numerous verses in the Qu'ran and New Testament.</ref>{{specify|date=January 2011}} Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold.

This punishment is intended to be sufficient that people would choose not to commit the crime rather than experience the punishment.  The aim is to deter everyone in the community from committing offences.\n\nSome criminologists state that the number of people convicted for crime does not decrease as a result of more severe punishment and conclude that deterrence is ineffective.<ref>reference | J. Mitchell Miller | 2009 | 21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook</ref> Other criminologists object to said conclusion, citing that while most people do not know the exact severity of punishment such as whether the sentence for murder is 40 years or life, most people still know the rough outlines such as the punishments for armed robbery or forcible rape being more severe than the punishments for driving too fast or misparking a car. These criminologists therefore argue that lack of deterring effect of increasing the sentences for already severely punished crimes say nothing about the significance of the existence of punishment as a deterring factor.<ref>reference | Gennaro F. Vito, Jeffrey R. Maahs | 2015 | Criminology</ref><ref>reference | Frank E. Hagan | 2010 | Introduction to Criminology: Theories, Methods, and Criminal Behavior</ref>\n\nSome criminologists argue that increasing the sentences for crimes can cause criminal investigators to give higher priority to said crimes so that a higher percentage of those committing them are convicted for them, causing statistics to give a false appearance of such crimes increasing. These criminologists argue that the use of statistics to gauge the efficiency of crime fighting methods are a danger of creating a reward hack that makes the least efficient criminal justice systems appear to be best at fighting crime, and that the appearance of deterrence being ineffective may be an example of this.<ref>reference | Anthony Walsh, Craig Hemmens | 2008 | Introduction to Criminology: A Text/Reader</ref><ref>Ronald L. Akers (2013). ''Criminological Theories: Introduction and Evaluation''</ref> Nay Nay\n\n=== Rehabilitation ===\n{{Main|Rehabilitation (penology)}}\nSome punishment includes work to reform and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] the culprit so that they will not commit the offence again.<ref name=justify/> This is distinguished from deterrence, in that the goal here is to change the offender's attitude to what they have done, and make them come to see that their behavior was wrong.\n\n=== Incapacitation and societal protection ===\nIncapacitation as a justification of punishment<ref name=justify/> refers to the offender's ability to commit further offences being removed. Imprisonment separates offenders from the community, for example, Australia was a dumping ground for early British criminals. This was their way of removing or reducing the offenders ability to carry out certain crimes. The death penalty does this in a permanent (and irrevocable) way. In some societies, people who stole have been punished by having their hands amputated.\n\n=== Retribution ===\n{{Main|Retributive justice}}\nCriminal activities typically give a benefit to the offender and a loss to the victim.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sir William Draper|first=Junius|date=1772|title=Lettres|url=|journal=Letters of Junius|volume=|pages=303\u2013305|via=}}</ref> Punishment has been justified as a measure of [[retributive justice]],<ref name=justify/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Falls|first=Margaret|date=April 1987|title=Retribution, Reciprocity, and Respect for Persons|journal=Law and Philosophy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25\u201351|jstor=3504678|doi=10.1007/BF00142639}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=K.

One reason [[society|societies]] have administered punishments is to diminish the perceived need for retaliatory \"street justice\", [[blood feud]], and [[vigilante|vigilantism]].\n\n=== Restoration ===\n{{Main|Restorative justice}}\nFor minor offenses, punishment may take the form of the offender \"righting the wrong\", or making restitution to the victim. [[Community service]] or compensation orders are examples of this sort of penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.la-articles.org.uk/libertarian_restitution.htm |title=restitution |publisher=La-articles.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>  In models of [[restorative justice]], victims take an ''active'' role in a process with their offenders who are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, \"to repair the harm they've done \u2013 by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service.\"<ref>\"A New Kind of Criminal Justice\", ''Parade'', October 25, 2009, p. 6.</ref>  The restorative justice approach aims to help the offender want to avoid future offences.\n\n=== Education and denunciation ===\n[[File:Schwaebisch Hall pillory.jpg|thumb|upright|Gothic [[pillory]] (early 16th century) in [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], Germany]]\nPunishment can be explained by positive prevention theory to use the criminal justice system to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct, and acts as a reinforcement.\n\nPunishment can serve as a means for society to publicly express denunciation of an action as being criminal. Besides educating people regarding what is not acceptable behavior, it serves the dual function of preventing vigilante justice by acknowledging public anger, while concurrently deterring future criminal activity by stigmatizing the offender.\nThis is sometimes called the \"Expressive Theory\" of denunciation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim01.htm |title=Theory, Sources, and Limitations of Criminal Law |accessdate=2011-09-26}}\n</ref>\nThe [[pillory]] was a method for carrying out public denunciation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title =Theories Of Punishment\n  | quote =Theories of punishment can be divided into two general philosophies: utilitarian and retributive.\n  | publisher =Free Legal Encyclopedia\n  | accessdate =2011-09-26\n  | url =http://law.jrank.org/pages/9576/Punishment-THEORIES-PUNISHMENT.html\n  }}\n</ref>\n\nSome critics of the education and denunciation model cite [[evolution]]ary problems with the notion that a feeling for punishment as a social signal system evolved if punishment was not effective. The critics argue that some individuals spending time and energy and taking risks in punishing others, and the possible loss of the punished group members, would have been selected against if punishment served no function other than signals that could evolve to work by less risky means.<ref>J.

Critics argue that punishment is simply [[revenge]]. Professor Deirdre Golash,  author of ''The Case against Punishment: Retribution, Crime Prevention, and the Law'', says:\n{{quote|We ought not to impose such harm on anyone unless we have a very good reason for doing so. This remark may seem trivially true, but the history of humankind is littered with examples of the deliberate infliction of harm by well-intentioned persons in the vain pursuit of ends which that harm did not further, or in the successful pursuit of questionable ends. These benefactors of humanity sacrificed their fellows to appease mythical gods and tortured them to save their souls from a mythical hell, broke and bound the feet of children to promote their eventual marriageability, beat slow schoolchildren to promote learning and respect for teachers, subjected the sick to leeches to rid them of excess blood, and put suspects to the rack and the thumbscrew in the service of truth. They schooled themselves to feel no pity\u2014to renounce human compassion in the service of a higher end. The deliberate doing of harm in the mistaken belief that it promotes some greater good is the essence of tragedy. We would do well to ask whether the goods we seek in harming offenders are worthwhile, and whether the means we choose will indeed secure them.<ref name=\"golash\">https://www.questia.com/read/117883311/the-case-against-punishment-retribution-crime-prevention</ref>}} Golash also writes  about [[imprisonment]]:\n\n{{quote|Imprisonment means, at minimum, the loss of liberty and autonomy, as well as many material comforts, personal security, and access to heterosexual relations. These deprivations, according to Gresham Sykes (who first identified them) \u201ctogether dealt 'a profound hurt' that went to 'the very foundations of the prisoner's being.\n\nBut these are only the minimum harms, suffered by the least vulnerable inmates in the best-run prisons. Most prisons are run badly, and in some, conditions are more squalid than in the worst of slums. In the District of Columbia jail, for example, inmates must wash their clothes and sheets in cell toilets because the laundry machines are broken. Vermin and insects infest the building, in which air vents are clogged with decades' accumulation of dust and grime. But even inmates in prisons where conditions are sanitary must still face the numbing boredom and emptiness of prison life\u2014a vast desert of wasted days in which little in the way of meaningful activity is possible.<ref name=\"golash\" />}}\n\n=== Destructiveness to thinking and betterment ===\nThere are critics of punishment who argue that punishment aimed at intentional actions forces people to suppress their ability to act on intent. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that such suppression of intention causes the harmful behaviors to remain, making punishment counterproductive. These people suggest that the ability to make intentional choices should instead be treasured as a source of possibilities of betterment, citing that complex cognition would have been an evolutionarily useless waste of energy if it led to justifications of fixed actions and no change as simple inability to understand arguments would have been the most thrifty protection from being misled by them if arguments were for social manipulation, and reject condemnation of people who intentionally did bad things.<ref>''Mind, Brain and Education'', Kurt Fischer, Christina Hinton</ref> Punishment can be effective in stopping undesirable employee behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism or substandard work performance.

Otherwise, it would be impossible to distinguish 'punishment' from 'revenge'. People in authority can, of course, inflict pain on people at whim. But this would be called 'spite' unless it were inflicted as a consequence of a breach of rules on the part of the sufferer. Similarly a person in authority might give a person \u00a35 as a consequence of his breaking a rule. But unless this were regarded as painful or at least unpleasant for the recipient it could not be counted as a case of 'punishment'. In other words at least three criteria of (i) intentional infliction of pain (ii) by someone in authority (iii) on a person as a consequence of a breach of rules on his part, must be satisfied if we are to call something a case of 'punishment'. There are, as is usual in such cases, examples that can be produced which do not satisfy all criteria. For instance there is a colloquialism which is used about boxers taking a lot of punishment from their opponents, in which only the first condition is present. But this is a metaphorical use which is peripheral to the central use of the term.<br /><br />In so far as the different 'theories' of punishment are answers to questions about the meaning of 'punishment', only the retributive theory is a possible one. There is no conceptual connection between 'punishment' and notions like those of 'deterrence', 'prevention' and 'reform'. For people can be punished without being prevented from repeating the offence, and without being made any better. It is also a further question whether they themselves or anyone else is deterred from committing the offence by punishment.

During a period of heavy fishing and tourism that encroached on their territory, they started to live in groups, learning from each other, especially hunting techniques.  Small, younger octopuses could be near the fully grown octopuses without being eaten by them, even though they, like other Octopus vulgaris, were [[cannibalism|cannibals]] until just before the group formation.{{Citation needed|reason=The source paper is missing and can not be found with a cursory google search|date=February 2017}} The authors stress that this behavior change happened too fast to be a genetic characteristic in the octopuses, and that there were certainly no mammals or other \"naturally\" social animals punishing octopuses for cannibalism involved. The authors also note that the octopuses adopted [[observational learning]] without any [[evolution]]ary history of specialized adaptation for it.<ref>\"Observational Learning in Octopus vulgaris.\" Graziano Fiorito, Pietro Scotto. 1992.</ref><ref>Aliens of the deep sea, documentary. 2011.</ref>\n\nThere are also arguments against the notion of punishment requiring intelligence, based on studies of punishment in very small-brained animals such as [[insect]]s. There is proof of [[honey bee]] workers with mutations that makes them fertile laying eggs only when other honey bees are not observing them, and that the few that are caught in the act are killed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This is corroborated by [[computer simulation]]s proving that a few simple reactions well within mainstream views of the extremely limited intelligence of insects are sufficient to emulate the \"political\" behavior observed in [[great ape]]s. The authors argue that this [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the claim that punishment evolved as a strategy to deal with individuals capable of knowing what they are doing.<ref>''How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence'', Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard, foreword by Rodney Brooks. 2006</ref>\n\nIn the case of more complex brains, the notion of evolution selecting for specific punishment of intentionally chosen breaches of rules and/or wrongdoers capable of intentional choices (for example, punishing [[human]]s for murder while not punishing lethal [[virus]]es) is subject to criticism from [[coevolution]] issues. That punishment of individuals with certain characteristics (including but, in principle, not restricted to mental abilities) selects against those characteristics, making evolution of any mental abilities considered to be the basis for penal responsibility impossible in populations subject to such selective punishment. Certain scientists argue that this disproves the notion of humans having a biological feeling of intentional transgressions deserving to be punished.<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1886).

[[Criminal]]s are punished judicially, by [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[corporal punishment]] or [[custodial sentence]]s such as [[prison]]; detainees risk further punishments for breaches of internal rules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyman Julius Nash|first=Wisconsin|date=1919|title=Wisconsin Statutes|url=|journal=Legislative Reference Bureau, 1919|volume=1|pages=2807\u20132808|via=}}</ref> [[Child]]ren, pupils and other trainees may be punished by their educators or instructors (mainly [[parent]]s, [[legal guardian|guardians]], or [[teacher]]s, tutors and [[coach (sport)|coaches]]) \u2013 see [[Child discipline]].\n\n[[Slaves]], domestic and other servants are subject to punishment by their [[Slave master|masters]]. Employees can still be subject to a contractual form of fine or [[demotion]]. Most hierarchical organizations, such as military and police forces, or even churches, still apply quite rigid internal discipline, even with a judicial system of their own ([[court martial]], [[canonical court]]s).\n\nPunishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in [[penance]] (which is voluntary) or imposed in a [[theocracy]] with a religious police (as in a strict [[Islamic state]] like [[Iran]] or under the [[Taliban]]) or (though not a true theocracy) by [[Inquisition]].\n\n==Hell as punishment==\nBelief that an individual's ultimate punishment is being sent by God, the highest authority, to an existence in Hell, a place believed to exist in the after-life, typically corresponds to [[sin]]s committed during their life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Christianity|damned souls]] suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.\n\nIn many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is traditionally depicted as fiery and painful, inflicting guilt and suffering.<ref>Numerous verses in the Qu'ran and New Testament.</ref>{{specify|date=January 2011}} Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist \u2013 and particularly Tibetan Buddhist \u2013 descriptions of hell feature an equal number of hot and cold hells. Among Christian descriptions [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' portrays the innermost (9th) circle of Hell as a frozen lake of blood and guilt.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Alighieri\n|first=Dante\n|authorlink=Dante Alighieri\n|others=trans.

This punishment is intended to be sufficient that people would choose not to commit the crime rather than experience the punishment.  The aim is to deter everyone in the community from committing offences.\n\nSome criminologists state that the number of people convicted for crime does not decrease as a result of more severe punishment and conclude that deterrence is ineffective.<ref>reference | J. Mitchell Miller | 2009 | 21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook</ref> Other criminologists object to said conclusion, citing that while most people do not know the exact severity of punishment such as whether the sentence for murder is 40 years or life, most people still know the rough outlines such as the punishments for armed robbery or forcible rape being more severe than the punishments for driving too fast or misparking a car. These criminologists therefore argue that lack of deterring effect of increasing the sentences for already severely punished crimes say nothing about the significance of the existence of punishment as a deterring factor.<ref>reference | Gennaro F. Vito, Jeffrey R. Maahs | 2015 | Criminology</ref><ref>reference | Frank E. Hagan | 2010 | Introduction to Criminology: Theories, Methods, and Criminal Behavior</ref>\n\nSome criminologists argue that increasing the sentences for crimes can cause criminal investigators to give higher priority to said crimes so that a higher percentage of those committing them are convicted for them, causing statistics to give a false appearance of such crimes increasing. These criminologists argue that the use of statistics to gauge the efficiency of crime fighting methods are a danger of creating a reward hack that makes the least efficient criminal justice systems appear to be best at fighting crime, and that the appearance of deterrence being ineffective may be an example of this.<ref>reference | Anthony Walsh, Craig Hemmens | 2008 | Introduction to Criminology: A Text/Reader</ref><ref>Ronald L. Akers (2013). ''Criminological Theories: Introduction and Evaluation''</ref> Nay Nay\n\n=== Rehabilitation ===\n{{Main|Rehabilitation (penology)}}\nSome punishment includes work to reform and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] the culprit so that they will not commit the offence again.<ref name=justify/> This is distinguished from deterrence, in that the goal here is to change the offender's attitude to what they have done, and make them come to see that their behavior was wrong.\n\n=== Incapacitation and societal protection ===\nIncapacitation as a justification of punishment<ref name=justify/> refers to the offender's ability to commit further offences being removed. Imprisonment separates offenders from the community, for example, Australia was a dumping ground for early British criminals. This was their way of removing or reducing the offenders ability to carry out certain crimes. The death penalty does this in a permanent (and irrevocable) way. In some societies, people who stole have been punished by having their hands amputated.\n\n=== Retribution ===\n{{Main|Retributive justice}}\nCriminal activities typically give a benefit to the offender and a loss to the victim.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sir William Draper|first=Junius|date=1772|title=Lettres|url=|journal=Letters of Junius|volume=|pages=303\u2013305|via=}}</ref> Punishment has been justified as a measure of [[retributive justice]],<ref name=justify/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Falls|first=Margaret|date=April 1987|title=Retribution, Reciprocity, and Respect for Persons|journal=Law and Philosophy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25\u201351|jstor=3504678|doi=10.1007/BF00142639}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=K.

Sometimes viewed as a way of \"getting even\" with a wrongdoer\u2014the suffering of the wrongdoer is seen as a desired goal in itself, even if it has no restorative benefits for the victim. One reason [[society|societies]] have administered punishments is to diminish the perceived need for retaliatory \"street justice\", [[blood feud]], and [[vigilante|vigilantism]].\n\n=== Restoration ===\n{{Main|Restorative justice}}\nFor minor offenses, punishment may take the form of the offender \"righting the wrong\", or making restitution to the victim. [[Community service]] or compensation orders are examples of this sort of penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.la-articles.org.uk/libertarian_restitution.htm |title=restitution |publisher=La-articles.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>  In models of [[restorative justice]], victims take an ''active'' role in a process with their offenders who are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, \"to repair the harm they've done \u2013 by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service.\"<ref>\"A New Kind of Criminal Justice\", ''Parade'', October 25, 2009, p. 6.</ref>  The restorative justice approach aims to help the offender want to avoid future offences.\n\n=== Education and denunciation ===\n[[File:Schwaebisch Hall pillory.jpg|thumb|upright|Gothic [[pillory]] (early 16th century) in [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], Germany]]\nPunishment can be explained by positive prevention theory to use the criminal justice system to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct, and acts as a reinforcement.\n\nPunishment can serve as a means for society to publicly express denunciation of an action as being criminal. Besides educating people regarding what is not acceptable behavior, it serves the dual function of preventing vigilante justice by acknowledging public anger, while concurrently deterring future criminal activity by stigmatizing the offender.\nThis is sometimes called the \"Expressive Theory\" of denunciation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim01.htm |title=Theory, Sources, and Limitations of Criminal Law |accessdate=2011-09-26}}\n</ref>\nThe [[pillory]] was a method for carrying out public denunciation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title =Theories Of Punishment\n  | quote =Theories of punishment can be divided into two general philosophies: utilitarian and retributive.\n  | publisher =Free Legal Encyclopedia\n  | accessdate =2011-09-26\n  | url =http://law.jrank.org/pages/9576/Punishment-THEORIES-PUNISHMENT.html\n  }}\n</ref>\n\nSome critics of the education and denunciation model cite [[evolution]]ary problems with the notion that a feeling for punishment as a social signal system evolved if punishment was not effective. The critics argue that some individuals spending time and energy and taking risks in punishing others, and the possible loss of the punished group members, would have been selected against if punishment served no function other than signals that could evolve to work by less risky means.<ref>J. Robert Lilly, Francis T. Cullen, Richard A. Ball  (2014). ''Criminological Theory: Context and Consequences''</ref><ref>Tim Newburn  2017  Criminology</ref>\n\n=== Unified theory ===\nA unified theory of punishment brings together multiple penal purposes\u2014such as retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation\u2014in a single, coherent framework. Instead of punishment requiring we choose between them, unified theorists argue that they work together as part of some wider goal such as the protection of rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0094.xml |title=Thom Brooks on Unified Theory of Punishment |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome people think that punishment as a whole is unhelpful and even harmful to the people that it is used against.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=G.T|first=Gwinn|date=1949|title=The effects of punishment on acts motivated by fear|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=39|issue=2|pages=260\u201369|doi=10.1037/h0062431|pmid=18125723}}</ref> Detractors argue that punishment is simply wrong, of the same design as \"[[two wrongs make a right]]\". Critics argue that punishment is simply [[revenge]]. Professor Deirdre Golash,  author of ''The Case against Punishment: Retribution, Crime Prevention, and the Law'', says:\n{{quote|We ought not to impose such harm on anyone unless we have a very good reason for doing so. This remark may seem trivially true, but the history of humankind is littered with examples of the deliberate infliction of harm by well-intentioned persons in the vain pursuit of ends which that harm did not further, or in the successful pursuit of questionable ends. These benefactors of humanity sacrificed their fellows to appease mythical gods and tortured them to save their souls from a mythical hell, broke and bound the feet of children to promote their eventual marriageability, beat slow schoolchildren to promote learning and respect for teachers, subjected the sick to leeches to rid them of excess blood, and put suspects to the rack and the thumbscrew in the service of truth. They schooled themselves to feel no pity\u2014to renounce human compassion in the service of a higher end. The deliberate doing of harm in the mistaken belief that it promotes some greater good is the essence of tragedy. We would do well to ask whether the goods we seek in harming offenders are worthwhile, and whether the means we choose will indeed secure them.<ref name=\"golash\">https://www.questia.com/read/117883311/the-case-against-punishment-retribution-crime-prevention</ref>}} Golash also writes  about [[imprisonment]]:\n\n{{quote|Imprisonment means, at minimum, the loss of liberty and autonomy, as well as many material comforts, personal security, and access to heterosexual relations. These deprivations, according to Gresham Sykes (who first identified them) \u201ctogether dealt 'a profound hurt' that went to 'the very foundations of the prisoner's being.\n\nBut these are only the minimum harms, suffered by the least vulnerable inmates in the best-run prisons. Most prisons are run badly, and in some, conditions are more squalid than in the worst of slums. In the District of Columbia jail, for example, inmates must wash their clothes and sheets in cell toilets because the laundry machines are broken. Vermin and insects infest the building, in which air vents are clogged with decades' accumulation of dust and grime. But even inmates in prisons where conditions are sanitary must still face the numbing boredom and emptiness of prison life\u2014a vast desert of wasted days in which little in the way of meaningful activity is possible.<ref name=\"golash\" />}}\n\n=== Destructiveness to thinking and betterment ===\nThere are critics of punishment who argue that punishment aimed at intentional actions forces people to suppress their ability to act on intent. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that such suppression of intention causes the harmful behaviors to remain, making punishment counterproductive. These people suggest that the ability to make intentional choices should instead be treasured as a source of possibilities of betterment, citing that complex cognition would have been an evolutionarily useless waste of energy if it led to justifications of fixed actions and no change as simple inability to understand arguments would have been the most thrifty protection from being misled by them if arguments were for social manipulation, and reject condemnation of people who intentionally did bad things.<ref>''Mind, Brain and Education'', Kurt Fischer, Christina Hinton</ref> Punishment can be effective in stopping undesirable employee behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism or substandard work performance. However, punishment does not necessarily cause an employee to demonstrate a desirable behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/1996/11/18/focus3.html|title=Punishment in the workplace creates undesirable side effects|last=Milbourn Jr|first=Gene|date=November 1996|website=|access-date=November 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Capital punishment]]\n** [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]]\n** [[List of capital crimes in the Torah]]\n** [[List of methods of capital punishment]]\n** [[List of people burned as heretics]]\n** [[List of people executed for witchcraft]]\n** [[Religion and capital punishment]]\n* [[Coercion]]\n* [[Corporal punishment]]\n* [[Devaluation (psychology)|Devaluation]]\n* [[Discipline (BDSM)]]\n* [[Hudud]]\n* [[Intimidation]]\n* ''[[Nulla poena sine lege]]''\n* [[Preventive state]]\n* [[Suffering]]\n* [[Telishment]]\n* [[Traumatic bonding]]\n}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Punishment |volume=22 |page=653 |short=1}}\n* [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \u2013 Punishment]\n* [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-punishment/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \u2013 Legal Punishment]\n* [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=punish&searchmode=none Etymology Online]\n* {{cite book |author=Brooks, Thom |title=Punishment |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0415850513 |doi=}}\n* {{cite book |author=Zaibert, Leo |title=Punishment and retribution |publisher=Ashgate |location=Hants, England |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0754623892 |oclc= |doi=}}\n* Lippke, Richard (2001). \u201cCriminal Offenders and Right Forfeiture.\u201d ''Journal of Social Philosophy'' 32:1, 78\u201389.\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{cite IEP |url-id=punishme |title=Punishment}}\n* {{cite IEP |url-id=m-p-puni |title=The Moral Permissibility of Punishment}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Punishment| ]]\n[[Category:Punishments| ]]\n[[Category:Social philosophy]]\n[[Category:Criminal justice]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment"}
