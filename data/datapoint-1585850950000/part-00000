Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, \"Murder can be fun.\" Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.\n\nWilliams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as \"Can You Read My Mind,\" appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as \"The Raiders March\" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nThe Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies (1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2005's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]])'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''.

Williams was asked to score all three, starting with ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes to be used as leitmotifs in 2002's ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and 2005's ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Most notable of these was \"[[Duel of the Fates]]\", an aggressive choral movement in the style of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]],<ref>[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A563942 h2g2 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition John Williams \u2013 Film Composer Updated Feb 8, 2010] ''h2g2.com'' accessed June 1, 2019 \"Reminiscent of the 'Dies Irae' from Verdi's Requiem, 'Duel of the Fates' was written to accompany the climactic lightsabre battle in the first of the Star Wars prequels.

K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, \"Hedwig's Theme\", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that \"their schedules simply did not align\", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|date=2010-11-12|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.

He soon gained notice in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for his versatility in composing jazz, piano, and symphonic music. Williams received his first Academy Award nomination for his score for 1967's [[Valley of the Dolls (film)|''Valley of the Dolls'']], and was nominated again for his score for 1969's [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)|''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'']].

He wrote the scores for 1972's [[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|''The Poseidon Adventure'']] and 1974's ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''. He also scored Universal's 1974 film [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] for director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]], completing a \"trinity\" of scores for the decade's highest-grossing \"disaster films\", and the 1972 film ''[[The Cowboys]]'', a western starring [[John Wayne]] and directed by [[Mark Rydell]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068421/fullcredits \"The Cowboys (1972) \u2013 Full Cast and Crew\"], imdb.com; retrieved November 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 1974 director [[Steven Spielberg]] approached Williams to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''. They teamed up again a year later for Spielberg's second film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.

Williams delivered a grand symphonic score in the fashion of [[Richard Strauss]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] Hollywood composers [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. The [[Star Wars (Main Title)|Star Wars' theme]], is among the most widely recognized in film history, and the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Force Theme]]\" and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Princess Leia's Theme]]\" are well-known examples of [[leitmotif]].

The original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy concluded with the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', for which Williams's score provided most notably the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Emperor's Theme]]\", \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Parade of the Ewoks]]\", and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Luke and Leia]]\". Both scores earned him Academy Award nominations.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n[[File:John Williams scoring Raiders.jpg|thumb|left|John Williams conducting the score to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in the Avery Fisher Hall]]\n\nWilliams scored the 1976 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Family Plot]]''. Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, \"Murder can be fun.\" Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.\n\nWilliams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as \"Can You Read My Mind,\" appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as \"The Raiders March\" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nThe Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies (1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2005's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]])'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''. Spielberg has said, \"I call it an honorable privilege to regard John Williams as a friend.\"<ref name=\"Spielberg_quote_cite\">{{cite AV media notes|last=Spielberg|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Spielberg|title=Jurassic Park Audio CD (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD)|publisher=[[MCA Records|MCA]]|chapter=Back cover|year=1993}} \"...and I consider it a privilege to call John my Friend.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. Williams was asked to score all three, starting with ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes to be used as leitmotifs in 2002's ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and 2005's ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Most notable of these was \"[[Duel of the Fates]]\", an aggressive choral movement in the style of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]],<ref>[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A563942 h2g2 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition John Williams \u2013 Film Composer Updated Feb 8, 2010] ''h2g2.com'' accessed June 1, 2019 \"Reminiscent of the 'Dies Irae' from Verdi's Requiem, 'Duel of the Fates' was written to accompany the climactic lightsabre battle in the first of the Star Wars prequels.

Also of note was \"Anakin's Theme\", which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister \"Imperial March.\" For ''Episode II'' Williams composed \"Across the Stars\", a love theme for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] (mirroring the love theme composed for ''The Empire Strikes Back'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-4-of-6-duel-of-the-fates/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 4|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-5-of-6-across-the-stars//|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 5|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref> The final installment combined many of the themes created for the series' previous films, including \"The Emperor's Theme,\" \"The Imperial March\", \"Across the Stars\", \"Duel of the Fates\", \"The Force Theme\", \"Rebel Fanfare\", \"Luke's Theme\", and \"Princess Leia's Theme\", as well as new themes for [[General Grievous]] and the film's climax, titled \"Battle of the Heroes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-6-of-6-battle-of-the-heroes/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 6|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the new millennium Williams scored the first three film adaptations of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, \"Hedwig's Theme\", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that \"their schedules simply did not align\", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|date=2010-11-12|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.

Singer did not request Williams to compose a score for the intentionally Donner-esque film, but he employed the skills of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' composer [[John Ottman]] to incorporate Williams's original ''Superman'' theme as well as those for [[Lois Lane]], [[Superman music|Krypton]] and [[Superman music#First appearance in Superman|Smallville]]. In 2011 the \"Main Title Theme\" and elements of \"Can You Read My Mind\" were used in the final scene of \"Finale,\" the series finale of the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]/[[The CW Television Network|CW]] television series ''[[Smallville]]''.<ref name=\"smallville\">{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|serieslink=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyer, [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] & Kelly Souders (writers); [[Greg Beeman]] & [[Kevin Fair]] (directors)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate=May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref> [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis, recommended by Williams to the producers]], performed a similar role for ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/Interviews/interviewdd2.htm|title=Composer Don Davis, Welcome to Jurassic Park|publisher=Tracksounds|date=2001-06-29|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 Williams returned to the ''Indiana Jones'' series to score the fourth film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''. He received a Grammy nomination for his work on the film. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was also the only film score from the ''Indiana Jones'' film series not to be nominated for an Academy Award. Also in 2008 Williams composed music for two documentaries, ''Warner at War''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323555/fullcredits Warner at War (2008) (TV) \u2013 Full cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed November 3, 2015.</ref> and ''A Timeless Call'',<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287857/fullcredits A Timeless Call (2008) \u2013 cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed December 28, 2015.</ref> the latter directed by Spielberg.\n\nAfter a three-year absence from film scoring, in 2011 Williams composed the scores for Spielberg's ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]''.
