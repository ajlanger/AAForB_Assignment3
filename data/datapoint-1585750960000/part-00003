In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the empire to become the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped establish communist states in these countries. Most communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. After a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called ''[[Juche]]''. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.\n\nToday, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|communist party]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty\".</ref> and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|communist party]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed's ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society\".</ref>\n\n=== Institutions ===\nCommunist states share similar institutions which are organized on the premise that the [[communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large.<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\">Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\"/> The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 12.</ref> They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn communist states, national legislative politics often has a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against [[Karl Marx]]'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 14.</ref> When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990) acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.\n\nA feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[Club (organization)|associations]] of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s and [[women's organization]]s) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nHistorically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)#1948\u20131990|Czechoslovakia]] or [[National Front (East Germany)|East Germany]] have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. In most of Europe, communist parties were highly popular and served in several coalition governments during the 20th century.

The state is not \"abolished\". It dies out\".{{sfn|Iman|1986|p=383}}\n\nThe introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} However, [[Joseph Stalin]] warned that the [[withering away of the state]] would not occur until after the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] had achieved dominance over capitalism.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} Soviet jurist [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary \"in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants\".{{sfn|Guns|1950|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nIdeology permeates these states.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} According to scholar Peter Tang, \"[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states it to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism\u2013Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism\u2013Leninism (Maoist China\u2013Albania model).{{sfn|Tang|1980|pp=42\u201343}} The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use China.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}}\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was mentioned in the [[Soviet constitution]].{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} Article 6 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]] stated: \"The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: \"In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The [[1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1975 Chinese constitution]] had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as \"building socialism and communism\", \"on the road to communism\", \"to build the material and technical basis of communism\" and \"to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations\" in the preamble.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}}\n\n=== People's democratic state ===\nThe [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democratic state]] was implemented in Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=16}} It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but it is eclipsed by the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport and credit.{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\nIn the words of [[Eugene Varga]], \"the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}} Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: \"People's democracy in the people's republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense we call it popular\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\n=== People's republican state ===\nThe [[People's republic|people's republican state]] is a type of socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with [[populist]] movements in the 19th century such as the German [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]] and the [[Narodniks]] in Russia, it is now associated to communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during [[World War I]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|its aftermath]] called themselves people's republics.

state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement few prospects there.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}}\n\nThe countries in which the national liberations movements took power and which instituted an [[anti-imperialist]] foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered as national-democratic states by Marxist\u2013Leninists.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] which was committed to constructing [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} With the exception of Cuba, none of these states managed to develop socialism.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state \"never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system\".{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} However, one feature was clearly defined, namely that these states did not need to be led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\n=== Socialist-oriented state ===\nA [[socialist-oriented state]] seeks to reach socialism by non-capitalist development.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} As a term, it is substantially different from the concept of the national-democratic state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} The singular difference is that the socialist-oriented state was divided into two stages, firstly into a national-democratic socialist-oriented state and secondly into a people's democratic socialist-oriented state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Countries belonging to the national-democratic socialist-oriented state category were also categorised as national-democratic states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Examples of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are [[Algeria]] ruled by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]] and [[Socialist Burma]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} In contrast, people's democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism\u2013Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as [[African socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\nThe socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people's democratic).{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=22}} The political goal of [[revolutionary democracy]] is to create the conditions for socialism in countries were the social, political and economic conditions for socialism do not exist.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=23}} The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=24}} While introduced in these states, [[democratic centralism]] is rarely upheld.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}}\n\nUnlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class and socialism were the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}} Since the peasantry were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role were emphasised\u2014similar to the working class in other socialist states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} However, Marxist\u2013Leninist admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the [[Derg|military in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} The establishing of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=44}} The fifth feature is that the media and educational system has to be taken over by the socialist-oriented state while establishing mass organisations to mobilise the populace.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=50\u201352}} Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are [[mixed economies]] that seek to attract [[foreign capital]] and which seeks to maintain and develop the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=54\u201355}} In the words of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], these states were in the process of taking over the [[commanding heights of the economy]] and instituting a state planned economy.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to Soviet sources, only Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=61}}\n\n=== Socialist state ===\nA [[socialist state]] is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a [[socialist economy]]. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist [[form of government]] before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people's democracies (a developmental stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]). On the question of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them to be socialist states\u2014referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist\u2013Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a [[communist party]] that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist\u2013Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.{{sfn|Wilczynski|2008|p=21|loc=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away of the state'.}}{{sfn|Steele|1999|p=45|loc=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}{{sfn|Rosser|2003|p=14|loc=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}\n\n== Political system ==\n=== Government ===\nIn communist states, the highest administrative agency of state power is the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} It functions as the executive organ of the legislature.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} The [[Supreme Soviet]] has been introduced with variations in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} and identical names were used for the governments of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its presidium, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|pp=202\u2013203}} The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature and in between sessions of the legislature it reported to the legislature's standing committee.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations and defense.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with few exceptions.{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} One exepction was Czechoslovakia, where it had a [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]] and not a collective presidency;{{sfn|Starr|1987|p=64}} and Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Dimitrov|2006|p=170}}\n\n=== Legislature ===\n==== Powers and organisation ====\n[[File:Great Hall Of The People At Night.JPG|thumb|The meeting place of the Chinese [[National People's Congress]]]]\nAll state power is unified in the legislature in communist states.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} This is a firm rejection of the [[separation of power]]s found in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The constitution is passed by the legislature and can only be amended by the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Judicial review and extra-parliamentary review were denounced by Soviet legal theorists as bourgeoisie institutions.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} They also perceived it as a limitation of the people's supreme power.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The legislature together with its suborgans was responsible for overseeing the constitutional order.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature's own acts cannot, therefore, be unconstitutional.{{sfn|Hazard|1985|p=163}}\n\nThe [[Supreme Soviet]] was the first socialist legislature and the Soviet legislative system has been introduced in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world's first frequently convened legislatures during its existence.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=91}} The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries as well as modern-day China.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|pp=114\u2013115}} China's legislature, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) is modeled on the Soviet one.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=114}} As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] (the Soviets had a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]), the government and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (the Soviet counterpart being the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]).{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=115}} In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=82}}\n\nWestern researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The reason being that there are not significant bodies of political socialization when compared to legislatures in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} While political leaders are often elected as members of socialist legislatures, these post are not relevant to political advancement.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The role of legislatures is different from country to country.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} In the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] did \"little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere\" while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}}\n\n==== Representativity ====\nBoth Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of [[bourgeois democracy]], but neither of them sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop [[proletarian democracy]] without \"without representative institutions\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Both of them considered the governing model of the [[Paris Commune of 1871]] in which executive and legislative were combined in one body to be ideal.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by \"universial suffrage in the various wards and town\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} While the institution of the socialist legislature might not be important in itself, they \"have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored\u2014in the language of the party's intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the [[mass line]] and learning from the people\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=6}}\n\nBy having legislatures, the Marxist\u2013Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the leading role of the party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} The seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as [[ethnicity]] and [[language]], \"yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation\u2014they meet too infrequently for this to be the case.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: \"As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the 'realm' ruled by (to stretch an anaology) 'kings'. Members of the assemblies 'represent' the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader 'segment of society' [...] than the court itself\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace\u2014the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}}\n\nIdeologically, it has another function, namely to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class, but all social strata.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature \"must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them it shows that communist states are committed to incorporate minorities and areas of the country by included them in the composition of the legislature.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} In this instance, it might mean that its less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} A member of a socialist legislature at central and local level is usually either a government or party official, leading figure in their community, or national figure outside the communist party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} This goes to show that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party's policies and ideological development.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}}\n\n=== Military ===\n==== Control ====\nCommunist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model,{{sfn|Kramer|1985|p=47}} but in China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, there are several differences between the statist (Soviet) model and the party-state model (China). In the Soviet model, the [[Soviet armed forces]] was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defense policies.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The party leader was ''[[ex officio]]'' the Chairman of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff which was tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=30}} The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], a state organ that functioned \"with the authority of a department of the [[CPSU Central Committe]]\".{{sfn|Loeber|1984|p=13}} The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanism at the center to the company level in the field.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and [[Komsomol]] organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retains control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=3}} The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=19}}\n\nIn the Chinese party-state model, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is a party institution.{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} In the preamble of the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], it is stated: \"The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People's Liberation Army and other people's armed forces\".{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPSU Central Committe]].{{sfn|Mulvenon|2012|p=251}} [[Mao Zedong]] described the PLA's institutional situation as follows: \"Every communist must grasp the truth, '[[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]'. Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party\".{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=6}} The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party\u2014it is an organ of the CPC Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People's Congress.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] is ''ex officio'' [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|party CMC Chairman]] and the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] is by right state CMC Chairman.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defense policies.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} There are fifteen departments that report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA.<ref name=\"rand\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/09/pla-reforms-and-their-ramifications.html|title=People's Liberation Army Reforms and Their Ramifications|last=Garafola|first=Cristina L.|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services and counterespionage work.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=23}}\n\n==== Representation ====\nUnlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} This is the case in all communist states.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} For instance, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Politburo]] since 1986.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In the 1986\u20132006 period, active military figures sitting in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Central Committee]] stood at an average of 9,2 percent.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]]) and other representative institutions.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In China, the two [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC vice chairmen]] have had by right office seats in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] since 1987.{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=4}}\n\n=== Ruling party ===\n==== Leading role ====\nEvery communist state has been led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Its membership is composed of members with advanced consciousness who are above sectional interests.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and through them leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|pp=27\u201328}} \n\nIn ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote that \"the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship\".{{sfn|Steiner|1951|p=58}} The current [[Constitution of Vietnam]] states in Article 4 that \"[t]he [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s thought, is the leading force of the state and society\".{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}} In a similar form, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) describes itself as \"the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation\".{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}} As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are [[vanguard parties]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] theorised that vanguard parties were \"capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party's leading role in leading the state{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} as seen in the CPC's self-description and Vietnam's constitution.{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}}{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}}\n\n==== Internal organization ====\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] and through it the state too.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}} It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organizations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}}\n\nThe highest organ of a Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party is the party congress.<ref name=\"CConly\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Committee-Soviet-political-body|title=Central Committee|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> The central committee is the party's highest decision-making organ in between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members as well as the party's leader.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee and the congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.<ref name=\"CConly\"/>\n\n== Economic system ==\nFrom reading their works, many followers of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|pp=1\u20132}} These ideas later developed into the belief that planning was superior to market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} Upon seizing power, the [[Bolsheviks]] began advocating a national state planning system.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] resolved to institute \"the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[Gosplan]], the State Planning Commission, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=9}} On introducing the planning system, it became common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organization then capitalism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}} This led to the system being introduced voluntary in countries such as China, Cuba and Vietnam and in some cases imposed by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}}\n\nIn communist states, the [[Soviet-type economic planning|state planning]] system had five main characteristics.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Firstly, with the exception of the field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Secondly, the system was [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]\u2014the center formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals set forth in it.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Fourtly, the predominace of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Michael Ellman, in a [[planned economy]] \"the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model the enterprises and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists, but plays a subsidiary role, and is expected to be temporary\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} The [[private ownership]] of the means of production still exist, although it plays a fairly smaller role.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=23}} Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, [[state ownership]] (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considering as a tool to end class struggle and to empower the working class.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=25}}\n\n== Judicial system ==\n=== Constitution ===\n==== Role of constitutions ====\n[[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] view the [[constitution]] as a [[Organic law|fundamental law]] and as an instrument of force.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=520}} The constitution is the source of law and legality.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} Unlike in [[liberal democracies]], the Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} To the contrary, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state\u2014believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} It is the belief of Marxist\u2013Leninists that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} In this instance, it means that Marxist\u2013Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} This contrasts with the liberal conception of [[constitutionalism]] that \"law, rather than men, is supreme\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xi}}\n\nUnlike the fixed nature of liberal democratic constitutions, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is ever-changing.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], a [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] during the 1930s, notes that the \"Soviet constitutions represent the sum total of the historic path along which the Soviet state has traveled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} That is, the constitution sums up what already has been achieved.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This belief is also shared by the [[Communist Party of China]] which argued that \"the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} A constitution in a communist state has an end.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}} For instance, the preamble of the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Chinese constitution]] outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, \"step by step, to bring about the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist industrialisation of the country]] and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist industry and commerce]]\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}}\n\nIn communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society's class structure, before enacting changes.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist\u2013Leninists legal theorists, including [[New Democracy|new democracy]], [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democracy]] and the [[primary stage of socialism]].{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}}\n\nWith [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|repudiation of Stalin's practices]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]'s repudiation of certain [[Maoist]] policies, Marxist\u2013Leninist legal theories began to emphasise \"the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xiii}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], not long after [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] 's death, noted that \"[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, so as to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=112}} In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that \"the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can or cannot do\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=114}} These legal developments have been echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law which runs parallel to and is disctint to the [[Rule of law|liberal term]] of the same name.{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=118}} In the last years, this emphasization on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society's development has been noted by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], who stated in 2013 that \"[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/03/chinas-constitution-debate-hits-a-sensitive-nerve/|title=China's constitution debate hits a sensitive nerve|last1=Wan|first1=William|last2=Qi|first2=Li|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Constitutional supervision ====\nAfter [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was elected by the legislature and leading jurists sat in the committee, but it was only empowered to advice the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Keith Hand has commented that \"[i]t was not an effective institution in practice\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} \n\n[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee which \"was subordinate only to the USSR constitution\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} It was empowered \"to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet\u2019s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored and it failed to defend the constitution during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=5}} \n\nThe [[Generations of Chinese leadership|Chinese leadership]] has argued against establishing a constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with failed communist states of Europe.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=15}} None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=16}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\n{{main|Socialist law}}\nAll communist states have been established in countries with a [[civil law system]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]\u2014all of whom had civil law legal system.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements and Vietnam used French law.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether [[socialist law]] is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Legal scholar Ren\u00e8 David wrote that the socialist legal system \"possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of [[Roman law]]\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=782}} Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is \"an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}} Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system, have identified the following features:{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is to disappear with the [[withering away of the state]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The rule of the Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is subordinate and reflect changes to the economic order (the absorption of [[private law]] by [[public law]]).{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law has a religious character.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n# The socialist law is [[prerogative]] rather than [[normative]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n\nLegal officials argue differently for their case than Westerners.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} For instance, \"[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} This changed with the introduction of the [[planned economy]] and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szab\u00f3 acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that \"four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist and socialist societies\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|pp=798\u201399}} Using the Marxst theory of [[historical materialism]], Szab\u00f3 argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different  from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} In other words, law is a tool by the [[ruling class]] to govern.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} As Ren\u00e8 David notes, socialist jurists \"isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=797}} However, some socialist legal theorists such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, \"[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as appears in certain writings of Western comparatists\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}} In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different type of society.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}}\n\nYugoslav jurist Borislav Blagojevic noted that a \"great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law\", further stating that it is \"necessary and justified\" to put them to use if they are \"in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=802}} Importantly, socialist law has retained civil law institutions, methodology and organization.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}} This can be discerned by the fact that [[East Germany]] retained the [[1896 German civil code]] until 1976 while [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] used existing Austrian, French, German and Russian civil codes until its adoption of its own civil code in 1964.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=801}} Scholar John Quigley wrote that \"[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}}\n\n== List of communist states ==\n=== Current communist states ===\nThe following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined.

In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the empire to become the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped establish communist states in these countries. Most communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. After a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called ''[[Juche]]''. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.\n\nToday, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|communist party]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty\".</ref> and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|communist party]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed's ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society\".</ref>\n\n=== Institutions ===\nCommunist states share similar institutions which are organized on the premise that the [[communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large.<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\">Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\"/> The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 12.</ref> They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn communist states, national legislative politics often has a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against [[Karl Marx]]'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 14.</ref> When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990) acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.\n\nA feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[Club (organization)|associations]] of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s and [[women's organization]]s) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nHistorically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)#1948\u20131990|Czechoslovakia]] or [[National Front (East Germany)|East Germany]] have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. In most of Europe, communist parties were highly popular and served in several coalition governments during the 20th century.

The state is not \"abolished\". It dies out\".{{sfn|Iman|1986|p=383}}\n\nThe introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} However, [[Joseph Stalin]] warned that the [[withering away of the state]] would not occur until after the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] had achieved dominance over capitalism.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} Soviet jurist [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary \"in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants\".{{sfn|Guns|1950|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nIdeology permeates these states.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} According to scholar Peter Tang, \"[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states it to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism\u2013Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism\u2013Leninism (Maoist China\u2013Albania model).{{sfn|Tang|1980|pp=42\u201343}} The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use China.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}}\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was mentioned in the [[Soviet constitution]].{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} Article 6 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]] stated: \"The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: \"In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The [[1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1975 Chinese constitution]] had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as \"building socialism and communism\", \"on the road to communism\", \"to build the material and technical basis of communism\" and \"to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations\" in the preamble.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}}\n\n=== People's democratic state ===\nThe [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democratic state]] was implemented in Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=16}} It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but it is eclipsed by the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport and credit.{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\nIn the words of [[Eugene Varga]], \"the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}} Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: \"People's democracy in the people's republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense we call it popular\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\n=== People's republican state ===\nThe [[People's republic|people's republican state]] is a type of socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with [[populist]] movements in the 19th century such as the German [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]] and the [[Narodniks]] in Russia, it is now associated to communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during [[World War I]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|its aftermath]] called themselves people's republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] following the [[October Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC|first=Anders|last=\u00c5slund|publisher=Peterson Institute|year=2009|isbn=9780881325461|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135940102|page=296}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Power, Networks and Violent Conflict in Central Asia: A Comparison of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv7pAwAAQBAJ|first=Idil|last=Tun\u00e7er-K\u0131lavuz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317805113|series=Routledge advances in Central Asian studies|volume=Volume 5|page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mongolic Elements in Tuvan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zddhapKVdHMC|first=Bayarma|last=Khabtagaeva|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2009|isbn=9783447060950|series=Turcologica Series|volume=Volume 81|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Peoples of Eastern Asia|volume=Volume 8: Mongolia\u2013Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAmmZ5kMC|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2004|first1=Fiona|last1=Macdonald|first2=Gillian|last2=Stacey|first3=Philip|last3=Steele|isbn=9780761475477|page=413}}</ref>\n\nAdditional people's republics emerged following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II, mainly within the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Democratisation and Institutional Reform in Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5FODwAAQBAJ|first=Elvin|last=Gjevori|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319730714|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bulgaria in British Foreign Policy, 1943\u20131949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCw2DgAAQBAJ|first=Marietta|last=Stankova|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2014|series=Anthem Series on Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies|isbn=9781783082353|page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Cabinets in Eastern Europe|doi=10.1057/9781403905215_6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|editor-first1=Jean|editor-last1=Blondel|editor-first2=Ferdinand|editor-last2=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first1=Ferdinand|last1=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first2=Zdenka|last2=Mansfeldov\u00e1|chapter=Chapter 5: Czech Republic|year=2001|isbn=978-1-349-41148-1|page=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Labour Law in Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1Ra6WYtqsgC|first=J\u00f3zsef|last=Hajd\u00fa|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=9789041137920|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Legal Reform in Post-Communist Europe: The View from Within|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAiYFR0MPXgC|first1=Stanis\u0142aw|last1=Frankowski|first2=Paul B.|last2=Stephan|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1995|isbn=9780792332183|page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=NATO and Eastern Europe After 2000: Strategic Interactions with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PE_D8ZewHKQC|first=Laure|last=Paquette|publisher=Nova|year=2001|isbn=9781560729693|page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ1x7gvwx_8C|first=John R.|last=Lampe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521774017|page=233}}</ref> In Asia, [[China]] became a people's republic following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese Revolution of 1949|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev|website=Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref> and [[North Korea]] also became a people's republic.<ref>{{cite book|title=North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EHfBQAAQBAJ|first1=Young Whan|last1=Kihl|first2=Hong Nack|last2= Kim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317463764|page=8}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ceased to use the term people's republic in their official name, replacing it with the term socialist republic as a mark of their ongoing political development.

National-democratic state ===\nThe concept of the national-democratic state tried to theorize how a state could develop socialism by bypassing the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} While the theory of non-capitalist development was first articulated by [[Vladimir Lenin]], the novelty of this concept was applying it to the progressive elements of the [[national liberation movements]] in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} The term national-democratic state was introduced shortly after the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement few prospects there.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}}\n\nThe countries in which the national liberations movements took power and which instituted an [[anti-imperialist]] foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered as national-democratic states by Marxist\u2013Leninists.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] which was committed to constructing [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} With the exception of Cuba, none of these states managed to develop socialism.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state \"never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system\".{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} However, one feature was clearly defined, namely that these states did not need to be led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\n=== Socialist-oriented state ===\nA [[socialist-oriented state]] seeks to reach socialism by non-capitalist development.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} As a term, it is substantially different from the concept of the national-democratic state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} The singular difference is that the socialist-oriented state was divided into two stages, firstly into a national-democratic socialist-oriented state and secondly into a people's democratic socialist-oriented state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Countries belonging to the national-democratic socialist-oriented state category were also categorised as national-democratic states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Examples of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are [[Algeria]] ruled by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]] and [[Socialist Burma]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} In contrast, people's democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism\u2013Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as [[African socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\nThe socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people's democratic).{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=22}} The political goal of [[revolutionary democracy]] is to create the conditions for socialism in countries were the social, political and economic conditions for socialism do not exist.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=23}} The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=24}} While introduced in these states, [[democratic centralism]] is rarely upheld.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}}\n\nUnlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class and socialism were the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}} Since the peasantry were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role were emphasised\u2014similar to the working class in other socialist states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} However, Marxist\u2013Leninist admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the [[Derg|military in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} The establishing of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=44}} The fifth feature is that the media and educational system has to be taken over by the socialist-oriented state while establishing mass organisations to mobilise the populace.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=50\u201352}} Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are [[mixed economies]] that seek to attract [[foreign capital]] and which seeks to maintain and develop the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=54\u201355}} In the words of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], these states were in the process of taking over the [[commanding heights of the economy]] and instituting a state planned economy.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to Soviet sources, only Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=61}}\n\n=== Socialist state ===\nA [[socialist state]] is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a [[socialist economy]]. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist [[form of government]] before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people's democracies (a developmental stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]). On the question of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them to be socialist states\u2014referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist\u2013Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a [[communist party]] that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist\u2013Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.{{sfn|Wilczynski|2008|p=21|loc=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away of the state'.}}{{sfn|Steele|1999|p=45|loc=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}{{sfn|Rosser|2003|p=14|loc=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}\n\n== Political system ==\n=== Government ===\nIn communist states, the highest administrative agency of state power is the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} It functions as the executive organ of the legislature.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} The [[Supreme Soviet]] has been introduced with variations in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} and identical names were used for the governments of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its presidium, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|pp=202\u2013203}} The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature and in between sessions of the legislature it reported to the legislature's standing committee.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations and defense.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with few exceptions.{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} One exepction was Czechoslovakia, where it had a [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]] and not a collective presidency;{{sfn|Starr|1987|p=64}} and Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Dimitrov|2006|p=170}}\n\n=== Legislature ===\n==== Powers and organisation ====\n[[File:Great Hall Of The People At Night.JPG|thumb|The meeting place of the Chinese [[National People's Congress]]]]\nAll state power is unified in the legislature in communist states.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} This is a firm rejection of the [[separation of power]]s found in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The constitution is passed by the legislature and can only be amended by the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Judicial review and extra-parliamentary review were denounced by Soviet legal theorists as bourgeoisie institutions.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} They also perceived it as a limitation of the people's supreme power.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The legislature together with its suborgans was responsible for overseeing the constitutional order.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature's own acts cannot, therefore, be unconstitutional.{{sfn|Hazard|1985|p=163}}\n\nThe [[Supreme Soviet]] was the first socialist legislature and the Soviet legislative system has been introduced in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world's first frequently convened legislatures during its existence.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=91}} The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries as well as modern-day China.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|pp=114\u2013115}} China's legislature, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) is modeled on the Soviet one.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=114}} As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] (the Soviets had a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]), the government and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (the Soviet counterpart being the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]).{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=115}} In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=82}}\n\nWestern researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The reason being that there are not significant bodies of political socialization when compared to legislatures in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} While political leaders are often elected as members of socialist legislatures, these post are not relevant to political advancement.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The role of legislatures is different from country to country.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} In the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] did \"little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere\" while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}}\n\n==== Representativity ====\nBoth Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of [[bourgeois democracy]], but neither of them sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop [[proletarian democracy]] without \"without representative institutions\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Both of them considered the governing model of the [[Paris Commune of 1871]] in which executive and legislative were combined in one body to be ideal.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by \"universial suffrage in the various wards and town\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} While the institution of the socialist legislature might not be important in itself, they \"have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored\u2014in the language of the party's intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the [[mass line]] and learning from the people\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=6}}\n\nBy having legislatures, the Marxist\u2013Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the leading role of the party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} The seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as [[ethnicity]] and [[language]], \"yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation\u2014they meet too infrequently for this to be the case.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: \"As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the 'realm' ruled by (to stretch an anaology) 'kings'. Members of the assemblies 'represent' the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader 'segment of society' [...] than the court itself\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace\u2014the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}}\n\nIdeologically, it has another function, namely to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class, but all social strata.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature \"must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them it shows that communist states are committed to incorporate minorities and areas of the country by included them in the composition of the legislature.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} In this instance, it might mean that its less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} A member of a socialist legislature at central and local level is usually either a government or party official, leading figure in their community, or national figure outside the communist party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} This goes to show that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party's policies and ideological development.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}}\n\n=== Military ===\n==== Control ====\nCommunist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model,{{sfn|Kramer|1985|p=47}} but in China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, there are several differences between the statist (Soviet) model and the party-state model (China). In the Soviet model, the [[Soviet armed forces]] was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defense policies.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The party leader was ''[[ex officio]]'' the Chairman of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff which was tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=30}} The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], a state organ that functioned \"with the authority of a department of the [[CPSU Central Committe]]\".{{sfn|Loeber|1984|p=13}} The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanism at the center to the company level in the field.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and [[Komsomol]] organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retains control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=3}} The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=19}}\n\nIn the Chinese party-state model, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is a party institution.{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} In the preamble of the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], it is stated: \"The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People's Liberation Army and other people's armed forces\".{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPSU Central Committe]].{{sfn|Mulvenon|2012|p=251}} [[Mao Zedong]] described the PLA's institutional situation as follows: \"Every communist must grasp the truth, '[[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]'. Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party\".{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=6}} The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party\u2014it is an organ of the CPC Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People's Congress.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] is ''ex officio'' [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|party CMC Chairman]] and the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] is by right state CMC Chairman.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defense policies.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} There are fifteen departments that report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA.<ref name=\"rand\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/09/pla-reforms-and-their-ramifications.html|title=People's Liberation Army Reforms and Their Ramifications|last=Garafola|first=Cristina L.|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services and counterespionage work.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=23}}\n\n==== Representation ====\nUnlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} This is the case in all communist states.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} For instance, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Politburo]] since 1986.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In the 1986\u20132006 period, active military figures sitting in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Central Committee]] stood at an average of 9,2 percent.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]]) and other representative institutions.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In China, the two [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC vice chairmen]] have had by right office seats in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] since 1987.{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=4}}\n\n=== Ruling party ===\n==== Leading role ====\nEvery communist state has been led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Its membership is composed of members with advanced consciousness who are above sectional interests.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and through them leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|pp=27\u201328}} \n\nIn ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote that \"the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship\".{{sfn|Steiner|1951|p=58}} The current [[Constitution of Vietnam]] states in Article 4 that \"[t]he [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s thought, is the leading force of the state and society\".{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}} In a similar form, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) describes itself as \"the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation\".{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}} As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are [[vanguard parties]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] theorised that vanguard parties were \"capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party's leading role in leading the state{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} as seen in the CPC's self-description and Vietnam's constitution.{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}}{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}}\n\n==== Internal organization ====\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] and through it the state too.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}} It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organizations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}}\n\nThe highest organ of a Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party is the party congress.<ref name=\"CConly\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Committee-Soviet-political-body|title=Central Committee|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> The central committee is the party's highest decision-making organ in between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members as well as the party's leader.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee and the congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.<ref name=\"CConly\"/>\n\n== Economic system ==\nFrom reading their works, many followers of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|pp=1\u20132}} These ideas later developed into the belief that planning was superior to market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} Upon seizing power, the [[Bolsheviks]] began advocating a national state planning system.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] resolved to institute \"the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[Gosplan]], the State Planning Commission, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=9}} On introducing the planning system, it became common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organization then capitalism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}} This led to the system being introduced voluntary in countries such as China, Cuba and Vietnam and in some cases imposed by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}}\n\nIn communist states, the [[Soviet-type economic planning|state planning]] system had five main characteristics.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Firstly, with the exception of the field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Secondly, the system was [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]\u2014the center formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals set forth in it.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Fourtly, the predominace of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Michael Ellman, in a [[planned economy]] \"the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model the enterprises and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists, but plays a subsidiary role, and is expected to be temporary\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} The [[private ownership]] of the means of production still exist, although it plays a fairly smaller role.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=23}} Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, [[state ownership]] (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considering as a tool to end class struggle and to empower the working class.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=25}}\n\n== Judicial system ==\n=== Constitution ===\n==== Role of constitutions ====\n[[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] view the [[constitution]] as a [[Organic law|fundamental law]] and as an instrument of force.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=520}} The constitution is the source of law and legality.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} Unlike in [[liberal democracies]], the Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} To the contrary, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state\u2014believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} It is the belief of Marxist\u2013Leninists that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} In this instance, it means that Marxist\u2013Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} This contrasts with the liberal conception of [[constitutionalism]] that \"law, rather than men, is supreme\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xi}}\n\nUnlike the fixed nature of liberal democratic constitutions, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is ever-changing.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], a [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] during the 1930s, notes that the \"Soviet constitutions represent the sum total of the historic path along which the Soviet state has traveled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} That is, the constitution sums up what already has been achieved.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This belief is also shared by the [[Communist Party of China]] which argued that \"the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} A constitution in a communist state has an end.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}} For instance, the preamble of the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Chinese constitution]] outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, \"step by step, to bring about the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist industrialisation of the country]] and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist industry and commerce]]\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}}\n\nIn communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society's class structure, before enacting changes.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist\u2013Leninists legal theorists, including [[New Democracy|new democracy]], [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democracy]] and the [[primary stage of socialism]].{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}}\n\nWith [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|repudiation of Stalin's practices]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]'s repudiation of certain [[Maoist]] policies, Marxist\u2013Leninist legal theories began to emphasise \"the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xiii}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], not long after [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] 's death, noted that \"[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, so as to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=112}} In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that \"the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can or cannot do\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=114}} These legal developments have been echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law which runs parallel to and is disctint to the [[Rule of law|liberal term]] of the same name.{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=118}} In the last years, this emphasization on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society's development has been noted by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], who stated in 2013 that \"[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/03/chinas-constitution-debate-hits-a-sensitive-nerve/|title=China's constitution debate hits a sensitive nerve|last1=Wan|first1=William|last2=Qi|first2=Li|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Constitutional supervision ====\nAfter [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was elected by the legislature and leading jurists sat in the committee, but it was only empowered to advice the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Keith Hand has commented that \"[i]t was not an effective institution in practice\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} \n\n[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee which \"was subordinate only to the USSR constitution\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} It was empowered \"to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet\u2019s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored and it failed to defend the constitution during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=5}} \n\nThe [[Generations of Chinese leadership|Chinese leadership]] has argued against establishing a constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with failed communist states of Europe.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=15}} None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=16}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\n{{main|Socialist law}}\nAll communist states have been established in countries with a [[civil law system]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]\u2014all of whom had civil law legal system.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements and Vietnam used French law.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether [[socialist law]] is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Legal scholar Ren\u00e8 David wrote that the socialist legal system \"possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of [[Roman law]]\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=782}} Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is \"an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}} Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system, have identified the following features:{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is to disappear with the [[withering away of the state]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The rule of the Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is subordinate and reflect changes to the economic order (the absorption of [[private law]] by [[public law]]).{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law has a religious character.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n# The socialist law is [[prerogative]] rather than [[normative]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n\nLegal officials argue differently for their case than Westerners.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} For instance, \"[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} This changed with the introduction of the [[planned economy]] and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szab\u00f3 acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that \"four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist and socialist societies\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|pp=798\u201399}} Using the Marxst theory of [[historical materialism]], Szab\u00f3 argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different  from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} In other words, law is a tool by the [[ruling class]] to govern.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} As Ren\u00e8 David notes, socialist jurists \"isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=797}} However, some socialist legal theorists such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, \"[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as appears in certain writings of Western comparatists\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}} In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different type of society.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}}\n\nYugoslav jurist Borislav Blagojevic noted that a \"great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law\", further stating that it is \"necessary and justified\" to put them to use if they are \"in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=802}} Importantly, socialist law has retained civil law institutions, methodology and organization.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}} This can be discerned by the fact that [[East Germany]] retained the [[1896 German civil code]] until 1976 while [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] used existing Austrian, French, German and Russian civil codes until its adoption of its own civil code in 1964.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=801}} Scholar John Quigley wrote that \"[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}}\n\n== List of communist states ==\n=== Current communist states ===\nThe following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined.
