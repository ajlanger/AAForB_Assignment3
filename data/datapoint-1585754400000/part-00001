This new bill ensures the \"fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about one's own reproductive health,\" specifically the right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to abort it, and denies a zygote, an embryo, or a fetus \"independent rights under the law\" of the State of Illinois. Pritzker encourages states that have passed restrictions on abortion to reconsider their positions and added that women from other states can seek refuge in his. Pritzker signed this bill at a time when the landmark Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v.

Funding for grade schools will rise by nearly $379 million, more than the $29 million required by the new state funding for education formula passed the previous year. Funding for community colleges will increase by $14 million, for public universities by $53 million. Grants for low-income students will receive a $50-million bump.

For years, public institutions of higher learning in Illinois have struggled financially and have lobbied for increased funding without much success.

For example, a family of four making $61,000 a year would pay $41 less income taxes before any other tax exemptions or deductions. Moreover, there will be a tax credit of up to $100 per child for individuals making less than $80,000 and joint filers earning under $100,000.

This new bill ensures the \"fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about one's own reproductive health,\" specifically the right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to abort it, and denies a zygote, an embryo, or a fetus \"independent rights under the law\" of the State of Illinois.

''Pictured'': Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.]]\nIn the balanced budget for the 2019-20 fiscal year, worth $40 billion, the State of Illinois authorized more spending on education, including grade schools, community colleges, and state universities. Funding for grade schools will rise by nearly $379 million, more than the $29 million required by the new state funding for education formula passed the previous year. Funding for community colleges will increase by $14 million, for public universities by $53 million. Grants for low-income students will receive a $50-million bump. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, currently facing financial pressure, will receive a total of $80 million for hiring new staff and improving services.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOn top of that, the Rebuild Illinois capital plan (2019) will spend some $3.2 billion for public colleges and universities over a period of six years. $78 million of that money is allocated to emergency repairs and delayed maintenance. However, because the capital plan relies on tax revenue on gambling and smoking, it will be a while before that money becomes available. For years, public institutions of higher learning in Illinois have struggled financially and have lobbied for increased funding without much success. Budget cuts and ballooning costs have been driving Illinois residents out of state. Tuition fees, room and board have doubled in virtually every state college or university since the 2003\u20134 academic year.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-cb-illinois-colleges-state-budget-20190619-ciz3kc7uxvg75ntwvhyfutx4ca-story.html|title=How much money are Illinois colleges getting in the new budget?
