By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land; Indians were not usually permitted to do so. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed from Iowa in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].\n\n===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860===\n\n{{Main|Michigan Territory|Wisconsin Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Iowa Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Iowa [[Seal of Iowa#Iowa territorial seal|Territorial Seal]]]]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]] who settled along the western banks of the [[Mississippi River]], founding the modern day cities of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]].<ref name=Settlers/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://co.jackson.ia.us/history.htm|title=Jackson County, Iowa History Information|publisher=Jackson County, Iowa|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref> On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].

On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>\"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa\", Marcus L.

The first fair was held October 25\u201327, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985===\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The [[Great Depression]] and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization.

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]].

Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land; Indians were not usually permitted to do so. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed from Iowa in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].\n\n===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860===\n\n{{Main|Michigan Territory|Wisconsin Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Iowa Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Iowa [[Seal of Iowa#Iowa territorial seal|Territorial Seal]]]]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]] who settled along the western banks of the [[Mississippi River]], founding the modern day cities of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]].<ref name=Settlers/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://co.jackson.ia.us/history.htm|title=Jackson County, Iowa History Information|publisher=Jackson County, Iowa|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref> On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].

On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>\"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa\", Marcus L.

The first fair was held October 25\u201327, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The fair was also a [[World War II]] wartime casualty from 1942 to 1945, as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |title=Iowa State Fair |publisher=Trivia |accessdate=December 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130160719/http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |archivedate=November 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Civil War, 1861\u20131865===\n\n[[File:Kirkwoods 1852.jpg|thumb|Jane and [[Samuel J.

The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985===\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The [[Great Depression]] and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization.

While agriculture continued to be the state's dominant industry, Iowans also produce a wide variety of products including refrigerators, washing machines, fountain pens, farm implements, and food products.\n\nThe [[farm crisis]] of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.<ref>The Midwest Farm Crisis of the 1980s, [http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id395.htm Tripod.com]</ref> The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.<ref name=\"iwin.iwd.state.ia.us\">Population Trends: The Changing Face of Iowa, [http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003011 State.ia.us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006013221/http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003011 |date=October 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985\u2013present===\n\nAfter bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture, and by the early 21st century was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services.<ref name=\"iowalifechanging.com\">''Iowa Industries'', Iowa Workforce Development.
