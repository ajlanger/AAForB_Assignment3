The Deputy Premiership has been a ministerial portfolio since 1932, and the Deputy Premier is appointed by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] on the advice of the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]].\n\nThe current Deputy Premier is the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 NSW|National Party]]'s [[John Barilaro]], who was sworn in on 15 November 2016.\n\n==History==\nThe office of Deputy Premier was created in May 1932 for [[Michael Bruxner]], the leader of the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 NSW|Country Party]] (later renamed the National Party). Prior to that time the term was sometimes used unofficially (without capital letters) for the second-highest ranking minister in the government.\n\nIn [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] governments, the Deputy Premier is the party's deputy leader. Generally speaking, this person has come from the left faction of the party whereas the Premier has come from the right faction. In [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal]]-National [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] governments, the position has been held by the Leader of the National Party or its predecessors.\n\nThree Deputy Premiers have subsequently become Premier in their own right: [[Joseph Cahill]], [[Robert Heffron]], and [[Jack Renshaw]]. However, this has not occurred since 1964.\n\n==Duties==\nThe duties of the Deputy Premier are to act on behalf of the Premier in his or her absence overseas or on leave. The Deputy Premier has always been a member of the [[New South Wales Ministry|Cabinet]], and has always held at least one substantive portfolio (It would be technically possible for a minister to hold only the portfolio of Deputy Premier, but this has never happened).\n\nIf the Premier were to die, become incapacitated or resign, the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] would normally appoint the Deputy Premier as Premier.  If the governing or majority party had not yet elected a new leader, that appointment would be on an interim basis.  Should a different leader emerge, that person would then be appointed Premier.\n\n==List of Deputy Premiers of New South Wales==\n; Political parties\n{{legend2|{{National Party of Australia/meta/color}}|[[National Party of Australia|Country/National]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Australian Labor Party/meta/color}}|[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2\n|-\n! colspan=2|No.\n!
