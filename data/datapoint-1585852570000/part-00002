It is a [[communes of France|commune]] located in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] [[departments of France|department]], and host city of the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Midem]], and [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]]. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|2011 G20 summit]].\n\n==History==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the [[Liguria]]n [[Oxybii]] established a settlement here known as ''Aegitna'' ({{lang-grc|\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1}}).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Aegitna|title=Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft|volume=I|year=1893|lang=de|page=477}}</ref> Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the [[L\u00e9rins Islands]].\n[[File:Cannes SPOT 1160.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Cannes seen from Spot Satellite]]\nIn 69 [[AD]], it became the scene of violent conflict between the troops of [[Otho]] and [[Vitellius]].<ref>Reported in [[Polybius]], Histories, 33.10.</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, the town was known as Canua.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meeks |first1=Jacqueline Monsigny, Edward |title=Le roman du festival de Cannes |date=2007 |publisher=Rocher |location=Monaco |isbn=978-2268061931 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruZkAAAAMAAJ |language=fr}}</ref> The name may derive from \"canna\", a [[Reed (plant)|reed]]. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\n\nAn attack by the [[Saracen]]s in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\n\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\n\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the [[Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus]]. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the [[Crimean War]].\n\n[[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux]] bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of [[Trams in Cannes|streetcars]]. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\n\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton]], [[Hotel Majestic Barri\u00e8re|Majestic]], [[Grand Hyatt Cannes H\u00f4tel Martinez|Martinez]], and [[JW Marriott Cannes]] were built. The city was modernised with a [[Stade Pierre de Coubertin (Cannes)|sports centre]], a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the [[World War I|First World War]], but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\n\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before [[World War II]]. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n==Climate==\nCannes has a [[subtropical]] [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when {{convert|110|mm|1|abbr=on}} falls.\n\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while average temperatures are about {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\n\nMean temperatures drop below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cannes (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 22.9\n|Feb record high C = 26.0\n|Mar record high C = 24.8\n|Apr record high C = 27.6\n|May record high C = 31.6\n|Jun record high C = 34.7\n|Jul record high C = 38.0\n|Aug record high C = 37.0\n|Sep record high C = 35.0\n|Oct record high C = 31.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.7\n|Dec record high C = 23.4\n|year record high C = 38.0\n|Jan high C = 13.1\n|Feb high C = 13.5\n|Mar high C = 15.7\n|Apr high C = 17.3\n|May high C = 21.0\n|Jun high C = 24.5\n|Jul high C = 27.5\n|Aug high C = 27.8\n|Sep high C = 24.8\n|Oct high C = 20.9\n|Nov high C = 16.7\n|Dec high C = 13.9\n|year high C = 19.7\n|Jan mean C = 8.4\n|Feb mean C = 8.7\n|Mar mean C = 10.8\n|Apr mean C = 13.0\n|May mean C = 16.9\n|Jun mean C = 20.5\n|Jul mean C = 23.2\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 20.2\n|Oct mean C = 16.6\n|Nov mean C = 12.3\n|Dec mean C = 9.2\n|year mean C = 15.3\n|Jan low C = 3.6\n|Feb low C = 3.9\n|Mar low C = 6.2\n|Apr low C = 8.7\n|May low C = 12.8\n|Jun low C = 16.4\n|Jul low C = 18.8\n|Aug low C = 18.8\n|Sep low C = 15.5\n|Oct low C = 12.3\n|Nov low C = 7.8\n|Dec low C = 4.6\n|year low C = 10.8\n|Jan record low C = \u221212.0\n|Feb record low C = \u22128.6\n|Mar record low C = \u22129.9\n|Apr record low C = \u22120.5\n|May record low C = 2.3\n|Jun record low C = 7.4\n|Jul record low C = 8.8\n|Aug record low C = 10.5\n|Sep record low C = 5.3\n|Oct record low C = 0.9\n|Nov record low C = \u22123.0\n|Dec record low C = \u22125.6\n|year record low C = \u221212.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 76.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 41.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 41.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 72.5\n|May precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 30.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 16.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 24.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 79.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 120.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 107.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 95.6\n|year precipitation mm = 756\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.80\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.80\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.97\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.53\n|May precipitation days = 5.17\n|Jun precipitation days = 3.73\n|Jul precipitation days = 1.83\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.77\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.43\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.03\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.20\n|Dec precipitation days = 6.50\n|year precipitation days = 60.8\n|Jan humidity = 72\n|Feb humidity = 70\n|Mar humidity = 70\n|Apr humidity = 70\n|May humidity = 73\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 72\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 75\n|Nov humidity = 74\n|Dec humidity = 72\n|year humidity = 72.3\n|Jan sun = 152.3\n|Feb sun = 175.3\n|Mar sun = 225.4\n|Apr sun = 225.3\n|May sun = 265.3\n|Jun sun = 311.5\n|Jul sun = 343.2\n|Aug sun = 316.0\n|Sep sun = 254.6\n|Oct sun = 193.5\n|Nov sun = 148.3\n|Dec sun = 133.8\n|year sun = 2750\n|source 1 = Meteo climat<ref name=MC1>{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-r25.php\n| title = Moyennes 1981/2010: R\u00e9gion Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9oclimat\n| language = French\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=MC2>{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=65\n| title = STATION Cannes\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9oclimat \n| language = French\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Infoclimat.fr (humidity 1961\u20131990)<ref name=Infoclimat>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie-07684-cannes-mandelieu.html\n| title = Normes et records 1961-1990: Cannes - Mandelieu (06) - altitude 2m \n| language = French\n| publisher = Infoclimat\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.eldoradocountyweather.com/climate/world-extremes/world-temp-rainfall-extremes.php?extremes=Eur</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n[[File:Cannes_Vieux_Port_01.jpg|thumb|250px|Panorama of the waterfront]]\n[[File:Cannes promenade.jpg|thumb|250px|Boulevard de la Croisette along the waterfront.]]\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Aero cannes.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Cannes Mandelieu aero centre]]\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a [[High tech|high-tech]] cluster.

They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes.

It is a [[communes of France|commune]] located in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] [[departments of France|department]], and host city of the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Midem]], and [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]]. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|2011 G20 summit]].\n\n==History==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the [[Liguria]]n [[Oxybii]] established a settlement here known as ''Aegitna'' ({{lang-grc|\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1}}).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Aegitna|title=Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft|volume=I|year=1893|lang=de|page=477}}</ref> Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the [[L\u00e9rins Islands]].\n[[File:Cannes SPOT 1160.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Cannes seen from Spot Satellite]]\nIn 69 [[AD]], it became the scene of violent conflict between the troops of [[Otho]] and [[Vitellius]].<ref>Reported in [[Polybius]], Histories, 33.10.</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, the town was known as Canua.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meeks |first1=Jacqueline Monsigny, Edward |title=Le roman du festival de Cannes |date=2007 |publisher=Rocher |location=Monaco |isbn=978-2268061931 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruZkAAAAMAAJ |language=fr}}</ref> The name may derive from \"canna\", a [[Reed (plant)|reed]]. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\n\nAn attack by the [[Saracen]]s in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\n\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\n\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the [[Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus]]. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the [[Crimean War]].\n\n[[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux]] bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of [[Trams in Cannes|streetcars]]. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\n\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton]], [[Hotel Majestic Barri\u00e8re|Majestic]], [[Grand Hyatt Cannes H\u00f4tel Martinez|Martinez]], and [[JW Marriott Cannes]] were built. The city was modernised with a [[Stade Pierre de Coubertin (Cannes)|sports centre]], a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the [[World War I|First World War]], but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\n\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before [[World War II]]. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n==Climate==\nCannes has a [[subtropical]] [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when {{convert|110|mm|1|abbr=on}} falls.\n\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while average temperatures are about {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\n\nMean temperatures drop below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cannes (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 22.9\n|Feb record high C = 26.0\n|Mar record high C = 24.8\n|Apr record high C = 27.6\n|May record high C = 31.6\n|Jun record high C = 34.7\n|Jul record high C = 38.0\n|Aug record high C = 37.0\n|Sep record high C = 35.0\n|Oct record high C = 31.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.7\n|Dec record high C = 23.4\n|year record high C = 38.0\n|Jan high C = 13.1\n|Feb high C = 13.5\n|Mar high C = 15.7\n|Apr high C = 17.3\n|May high C = 21.0\n|Jun high C = 24.5\n|Jul high C = 27.5\n|Aug high C = 27.8\n|Sep high C = 24.8\n|Oct high C = 20.9\n|Nov high C = 16.7\n|Dec high C = 13.9\n|year high C = 19.7\n|Jan mean C = 8.4\n|Feb mean C = 8.7\n|Mar mean C = 10.8\n|Apr mean C = 13.0\n|May mean C = 16.9\n|Jun mean C = 20.5\n|Jul mean C = 23.2\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 20.2\n|Oct mean C = 16.6\n|Nov mean C = 12.3\n|Dec mean C = 9.2\n|year mean C = 15.3\n|Jan low C = 3.6\n|Feb low C = 3.9\n|Mar low C = 6.2\n|Apr low C = 8.7\n|May low C = 12.8\n|Jun low C = 16.4\n|Jul low C = 18.8\n|Aug low C = 18.8\n|Sep low C = 15.5\n|Oct low C = 12.3\n|Nov low C = 7.8\n|Dec low C = 4.6\n|year low C = 10.8\n|Jan record low C = \u221212.0\n|Feb record low C = \u22128.6\n|Mar record low C = \u22129.9\n|Apr record low C = \u22120.5\n|May record low C = 2.3\n|Jun record low C = 7.4\n|Jul record low C = 8.8\n|Aug record low C = 10.5\n|Sep record low C = 5.3\n|Oct record low C = 0.9\n|Nov record low C = \u22123.0\n|Dec record low C = \u22125.6\n|year record low C = \u221212.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 76.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 41.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 41.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 72.5\n|May precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 30.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 16.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 24.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 79.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 120.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 107.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 95.6\n|year precipitation mm = 756\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.80\n|Feb precipitation days = 4.80\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.97\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.53\n|May precipitation days = 5.17\n|Jun precipitation days = 3.73\n|Jul precipitation days = 1.83\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.77\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.43\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.03\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.20\n|Dec precipitation days = 6.50\n|year precipitation days = 60.8\n|Jan humidity = 72\n|Feb humidity = 70\n|Mar humidity = 70\n|Apr humidity = 70\n|May humidity = 73\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 72\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 75\n|Nov humidity = 74\n|Dec humidity = 72\n|year humidity = 72.3\n|Jan sun = 152.3\n|Feb sun = 175.3\n|Mar sun = 225.4\n|Apr sun = 225.3\n|May sun = 265.3\n|Jun sun = 311.5\n|Jul sun = 343.2\n|Aug sun = 316.0\n|Sep sun = 254.6\n|Oct sun = 193.5\n|Nov sun = 148.3\n|Dec sun = 133.8\n|year sun = 2750\n|source 1 = Meteo climat<ref name=MC1>{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-r25.php\n| title = Moyennes 1981/2010: R\u00e9gion Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9oclimat\n| language = French\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=MC2>{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=65\n| title = STATION Cannes\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9oclimat \n| language = French\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Infoclimat.fr (humidity 1961\u20131990)<ref name=Infoclimat>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie-07684-cannes-mandelieu.html\n| title = Normes et records 1961-1990: Cannes - Mandelieu (06) - altitude 2m \n| language = French\n| publisher = Infoclimat\n| accessdate = December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.eldoradocountyweather.com/climate/world-extremes/world-temp-rainfall-extremes.php?extremes=Eur</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n[[File:Cannes_Vieux_Port_01.jpg|thumb|250px|Panorama of the waterfront]]\n[[File:Cannes promenade.jpg|thumb|250px|Boulevard de la Croisette along the waterfront.]]\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Aero cannes.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Cannes Mandelieu aero centre]]\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a [[High tech|high-tech]] cluster. The technopolis of [[Sophia Antipolis]] lies in the hills beyond Cannes. The Film Festival is a major event for the industry which takes place every year during the month of May. In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cannes-destination.com/index/flagship-envents-in-cannes|title=Major events in Cannes (French Riviera) - Program & Information|website=www.cannes-destination.com|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>  There is an annual television festival in the last week in September.\n\nThe economic environment is based on tourism, business fairs, trade and aviation.

In 2006, 421 new companies were registered.\n\nCannes hosts the [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], headquarters of [[Thales Alenia Space]], the first European [[satellite]] manufacturer.\n\n==Sport==\nCannes is home to football side [[AS Cannes]].\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe [[Promenade de la Croisette]] is the waterfront avenue with [[palm trees]]. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and boutiques. [[Le Suquet]], the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Castre]]. A distinctive building in Cannes is the [[St. Michael the Archangel Church (Cannes)|Russian Orthodox church]].\n\n===Museums===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n===Villas===\n[[File:\u201cCannes Cinema\u201d mural on Place Cornut-Gentille.jpg|alt=\u201cCannes Cinema\u201d mural on Place Cornut-Gentille|thumb|\u201cCannes Cinema\u201d mural on Place Cornut-Gentille]]\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near [[Florence]], which may be visited on appointment.\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n[[File:Cannes hombre de la mascara de hierro.jpg|alt=Last refuge of the man in the iron mask in Cannes, France|thumb|Last refuge of the [[Man in the Iron Mask|man in the iron mask]] in Cannes, France]]\nIt took the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] 11 years to leave the tiny, forested [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite|St Marguerite Island]]. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern [[\u00cele Saint-Honorat|St Honorat Island]]. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, [[Mougins]], and [[Vallauris]]. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the [[L\u00e9rins Abbey]] and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n===Theatre and music===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre.
