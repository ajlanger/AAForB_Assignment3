She was the first of five children born to George Smith, and Ruth Chapman. George Smith was a soldier, having enlisted in the 2nd Regiment [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] in December 1834. Chapman's parents were not married at the time of her birth, although they married on 22 February 1842, in Paddington. Following the birth of their second child in 1844, the family relocated to [[Knightsbridge]], where George Smith became a [[valet]].<ref>''Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder: A Student Textbook'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-97621-4}} p. 73</ref> The family eventually relocated to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1856.<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 63</ref>\nHello\n[[Census]] records from 1861 indicate all members of the Smith family\u2014except Annie\u2014had relocated to the parish of [[Clewer]].

The marriage was witnessed by one of her sisters, Emily Laticia, and a colleague of her husband named George White.<ref name=shelden>'Annie Chapman: Jack the Ripper Victim A Short Biography'. Written and published by Neal Shelden (2001)</ref> Initially, the couple resided in Montpelier Place, [[Brompton, London|Brompton]], although in the years following their marriage, the Chapmans lived at various [[West London]] addresses. The couple had three children: Emily Ruth (b. 25 June 1870); Annie Georgina (b. 5 June 1873); and John Alfred (b. 21 November 1880). Emily Ruth was born at Chapman's mother's home in Monpelier Place, Knightsbridge; Annie Georgina was born at South Bruton Mews, [[Mayfair]]; and John Alfred was born in the [[Berkshire]] village of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]].<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-39615-9}} ch. 6</ref> John was born [[cripple]]d,<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 25</ref> leadng the Chapmans to seek medical help for their son at a London hospital before later placing him in the care of an institution for the physically disabled. Although Chapman had struggled with [[alcoholism]] as an adult, she had reportedly weaned herself off drink by 1880. Her son's disability is believed to have contributed to Chapman's reversion to [[alcohol dependency]].<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref>\n[[File:EmilyRuthChapmanAnnieChapmanDaughterc.1879a.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Emily Ruth Chapman.

The following year, Emily Ruth Chapman died of [[meningitis]] on her brother's second birthday at the age of 12.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia p29\" />\n\nFollowing the death of their daughter, both Chapman and her husband took to heavy drinking.<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref> Over the following years, she is known to have been arrested on several occasions for [[public intoxication]] in both Clewer and Windsor.<ref>''Complete Jack The Ripper'' {{ISBN|0-14-017395-1}} p. 39</ref> The couple separated by mutual consent in 1884,<ref name=shelden/> with John Chapman being obliged to pay his wife a weekly allowance of 10[[Shilling|s]] via Post Office Order.

Over the following years, she resided in [[common lodging-house]]s in both Whitechapel and Spitalfields.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|0-582-50631-X}} p. 188</ref> In 1886, she is known to have resided with a man who made wire sieves for a living.

However, at the end of 1886, these payments abruptly stopped. Upon enquiring why these weekly payments had suddenly ceased, Chapman discovered her husband had died of alcohol-related causes. Shortly thereafter\u2014possibly due to the cessation of Chapman's inheritance\u2014this sieve-maker left Chapman. One of her friends later testified Chapman had subsequently become very [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and generally seemed to abandon the [[Volition (psychology)|will]] to live.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/jack-the-ripper/crimes|title=The Man Who Shook a City|website=crimeandinvestigation.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of Chapman's death, her son John had been placed in the care of an institution for the physically disabled.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: From the Cradle to the Grave'' {{ISBN|978-1-481-79895-2}} p. 114</ref> Her surviving daughter, Annie Georgina, then an adolescent, was travelling with a circus in France.<ref name=shelden/>\n\n==1888==\nBy May or June of 1888, Chapman resided in Crossingham's Lodging House at 35 [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]],<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|0-582-50631-X}} p. 188</ref> paying 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] a night for a double bed.

In the police records, however, she is identified as \"Long Mrs. alias Durrell\" (HO 144/221/A49301C f. 136, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 289).</ref> testified at the subsequent [[inquest]] into Chapman's murder that she had seen Chapman talking with a man at approximately 5:30 a.m. on 8 September. The two had stood just beyond the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields. Mrs. Long described the man as being over forty years of age, slightly taller than Chapman, with dark hair, and of a foreign, \"shabby-[[Gentry|genteel]]\" appearance.<ref name=begg153/> He was wearing a [[Deerstalker|deer-stalker hat]] and dark overcoat.<ref name=begg153>Begg, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> If Elizabeth Long was correct with regards to her identification of Chapman and the description of the individual in her company at the time of this sighting, it is likely she was the last person to see Chapman alive, and in the company of her murderer.<ref>''The Real Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-845-29182-2}} p. 369</ref>\n\n===Murder===\nShortly before 5:00&nbsp;a.m. on 8 September, the son of a resident of 29 Hanbury Street, John Richardson, entered the back yard of the property to trim a loose piece of leather from his boot.

Her body was lying on the ground near the doorway to the back yard. A leather apron, partially submerged in a dish of water, was discovered close to her body.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54982-5}} p. 255</ref>\n\nTwo pills, which Chapman had been prescribed for a lung condition, a section of a torn envelope, a small piece of frayed [[muslin]], and a comb were recovered close to her body. Two brass rings Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had [[Pawnbroker|pawned]] them or because they had been stolen.<ref>Fido, pp. 31\u201332</ref> All the pawnbrokers in the area were searched for the rings without success.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\">Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69</ref> The envelope bore the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], and was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, who is known to have falsely claimed to be an army veteran, in receipt of a pension. This lead of enquiry was abandoned after police discovered Chapman had wrapped the pills in this section of envelope at Crossingham's Lodging House just hours before her murder.<ref>Fido, p. 32</ref>\n\nContemporary press reports claimed that two [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street, but these coins are not mentioned in the surviving police records.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\"/> The local inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also mentioned them in his memoirs.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/> Smith's memoirs, however, are unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect, and were written more than twenty years after the event.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> Smith claimed medical students frequently polished farthings so they could be passed off as [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to unsuspecting prostitutes, and so the presence of the farthings suggested the culprit may have been a medical student. However, the price to solicit the services of an East End prostitute was as little as [[Fourpence (British coin)|4d]]\u2014much less than a sovereign.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/>\n[[File:Bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' sketch of Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]] examining the body of Annie Chapman at 29 Hanbury Street]]\nThe first officer on the scene was inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler of H Division, but Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] of [[Scotland Yard]] was placed in overall command on 15 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 69, 85</ref> The murder was quickly linked to similar murders in the district, particularly to that of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] a week previously. Nichols had also suffered a slash to the throat and abdominal wounds, and a blade of similar size and design had been used. Swanson reported that an \"immediate and searching enquiry was made at all common lodging-houses to ascertain if anyone had entered that morning with blood on his hands or clothes, or under any suspicious circumstances\".<ref>Report of Superintendent Swanson, 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 68</ref> The body was conveyed later that day to Whitechapel mortuary in the same police ambulance, which was a handcart just large enough for one coffin, used for Nichols by Sergeant [[Edward Badham]].<ref>Marriott, p. 46</ref> Badham was the first to testify at the subsequent inquest.\n\n=== Inquest ===\nThe inquest was opened on 10 September at the Working Lad's Institute, Whitechapel, by local coroner [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]]. Evidence indicated that Chapman may have been killed as late as 5:30 a.m., in the enclosed back yard of a house occupied by sixteen people,<!--There were 17 residents but one was out at the time of the murder (Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 76)--> none of whom had seen or heard anything at the time of the murder.<ref>Coroner Baxter quoted in Marriott, p. 71</ref> The passage through the house to the back-yard was not locked, as it was frequented by the residents at all hours of the day, and the front door was wide open when the body was discovered.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 71</ref> Richardson said that he had often seen strangers, both men and women, in the passage of the house.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 78</ref> Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]], the police surgeon, described the body as he saw it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street:\n{{quote|text=The left arm was placed across the left breast. The legs were drawn up, the feet resting on the ground, and the knees turned outwards. The face was swollen and turned on the right side. The tongue protruded between the front teeth, but not beyond the lips. The tongue was evidently much swollen. The front teeth were perfect as far as the first molar, top and bottom and very fine teeth they were. The body was terribly mutilated&nbsp;... the stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but was evidently commencing. He noticed that the throat was dissevered deeply; that the incision through the skin were jagged and reached right round the neck&nbsp;... On the wooden [[Palisade|paling]] between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.&nbsp;...\n\nThe instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning. He should say it was not tied on after the throat was cut.<ref>''The Times'', 14 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 85\u201388</ref>}}\n[[File:Annie Chapman mortuary photo.jpg|thumb|160px|Mortuary photograph of Annie Chapman]]\nChapman's throat had been cut from left to right so deeply the bones of her [[vertebral column]] bore striations,<ref>''Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-848-68522-2}} p. 158</ref> and she had been [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh\u2014plus her [[small intestine]]s\u2014being removed and placed above her right shoulder.<ref>''The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-79040-9}} pp. 55-56</ref> The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing.

She was laid to rest in a communal grave within Manor Park Cemetery, [[Forest Gate]], east London. At the request of Chapman's family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] used throughout the service, and only the [[undertaker]], police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Resultingly, her family members were the only mourners to attend the service.<ref>''Ripper Notes: Death in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-0-975-91295-9}} p. 94</ref>\n\nA hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker H. Smith travelled to the Whitechapel Mortuary in Montague Street to collect Chapman's body at 7:00 a.m. Her body was placed in an [[elm]] coffin draped in black and was then driven to a Spitalfields undertaker named Harry Hawes, who arranged the funeral. Chapman's relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery. Her coffin bore the words \"Annie Chapman, died Sept. 8, 1888, aged 48 years.\"<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', 15 September 1888, p. 3</ref>\n\nThe grave of Annie Chapman no longer exists.

Chapman's parents were not married at the time of her birth, although they married on 22 February 1842, in Paddington. Following the birth of their second child in 1844, the family relocated to [[Knightsbridge]], where George Smith became a [[valet]].<ref>''Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder: A Student Textbook'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-97621-4}} p. 73</ref> The family eventually relocated to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1856.<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 63</ref>\n\n[[Census]] records from 1861 indicate all members of the Smith family\u2014except Annie\u2014had relocated to the parish of [[Clewer]]. Chapman is believed to have remained in London, possibly due to her employment commitments as a domestic servant.

Emily Ruth was born at Chapman's mother's home in Monpelier Place, Knightsbridge; Annie Georgina was born at South Bruton Mews, [[Mayfair]]; and John Alfred was born in the [[Berkshire]] village of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]].<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-39615-9}} ch. 6</ref> John was born [[cripple]]d,<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 25</ref> leadng the Chapmans to seek medical help for their son at a London hospital before later placing him in the care of an institution for the physically disabled. Although Chapman had struggled with [[alcoholism]] as an adult, she had reportedly weaned herself off drink by 1880. Her son's disability is believed to have contributed to Chapman's reversion to [[alcohol dependency]].<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref>\n[[File:EmilyRuthChapmanAnnieChapmanDaughterc.1879a.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Emily Ruth Chapman.

However, at the end of 1886, these payments abruptly stopped. Upon enquiring why these weekly payments had suddenly ceased, Chapman discovered her husband had died of alcohol-related causes. Shortly thereafter\u2014possibly due to the cessation of Chapman's inheritance\u2014this sieve-maker left Chapman.

The two had stood just beyond the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields. Mrs. Long described the man as being over forty years of age, slightly taller than Chapman, with dark hair, and of a foreign, \"shabby-[[Gentry|genteel]]\" appearance.<ref name=begg153/> He was wearing a [[Deerstalker|deer-stalker hat]] and dark overcoat.<ref name=begg153>Begg, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> If Elizabeth Long was correct with regards to her identification of Chapman and the description of the individual in her company at the time of this sighting, it is likely she was the last person to see Chapman alive, and in the company of her murderer.<ref>''The Real Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-845-29182-2}} p. 369</ref>\n\n===Murder===\nShortly before 5:00&nbsp;a.m. on 8 September, the son of a resident of 29 Hanbury Street, John Richardson, entered the back yard of the property to trim a loose piece of leather from his boot.

Cadosch later informed police he had heard a woman say, \"No!\" before hearing the sound of something or someone falling against the fence dividing the back yards of numbers 27 and 29 Hanbury Street.<ref>Begg, p. 153; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 100; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> He did not investigate these sounds.<ref>''Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-904-04869-5}} p. 37</ref>\n[[File:29 Hanbury Street.jpg|230px|thumb|left|The entrance to the yard of 29 Hanbury Street. Chapman's body was found close to the steps of this property on 8 September 1888]]\nAnnie Chapman's mutilated body was discovered shortly before 6:00 a.m. on the morning of 8 September by a resident of 29 Hanbury Street named John Davis. Her body was lying on the ground near the doorway to the back yard. A leather apron, partially submerged in a dish of water, was discovered close to her body.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54982-5}} p. 255</ref>\n\nTwo pills, which Chapman had been prescribed for a lung condition, a section of a torn envelope, a small piece of frayed [[muslin]], and a comb were recovered close to her body. Two brass rings Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had [[Pawnbroker|pawned]] them or because they had been stolen.<ref>Fido, pp. 31\u201332</ref> All the pawnbrokers in the area were searched for the rings without success.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\">Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69</ref> The envelope bore the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], and was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, who is known to have falsely claimed to be an army veteran, in receipt of a pension. This lead of enquiry was abandoned after police discovered Chapman had wrapped the pills in this section of envelope at Crossingham's Lodging House just hours before her murder.<ref>Fido, p. 32</ref>\n\nContemporary press reports claimed that two [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street, but these coins are not mentioned in the surviving police records.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\"/> The local inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also mentioned them in his memoirs.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/> Smith's memoirs, however, are unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect, and were written more than twenty years after the event.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> Smith claimed medical students frequently polished farthings so they could be passed off as [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to unsuspecting prostitutes, and so the presence of the farthings suggested the culprit may have been a medical student. However, the price to solicit the services of an East End prostitute was as little as [[Fourpence (British coin)|4d]]\u2014much less than a sovereign.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/>\n[[File:Bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' sketch of Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]] examining the body of Annie Chapman at 29 Hanbury Street]]\nThe first officer on the scene was inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler of H Division, but Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] of [[Scotland Yard]] was placed in overall command on 15 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 69, 85</ref> The murder was quickly linked to similar murders in the district, particularly to that of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] a week previously. Nichols had also suffered a slash to the throat and abdominal wounds, and a blade of similar size and design had been used. Swanson reported that an \"immediate and searching enquiry was made at all common lodging-houses to ascertain if anyone had entered that morning with blood on his hands or clothes, or under any suspicious circumstances\".<ref>Report of Superintendent Swanson, 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 68</ref> The body was conveyed later that day to Whitechapel mortuary in the same police ambulance, which was a handcart just large enough for one coffin, used for Nichols by Sergeant [[Edward Badham]].<ref>Marriott, p. 46</ref> Badham was the first to testify at the subsequent inquest.\n\n=== Inquest ===\nThe inquest was opened on 10 September at the Working Lad's Institute, Whitechapel, by local coroner [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]]. Evidence indicated that Chapman may have been killed as late as 5:30 a.m., in the enclosed back yard of a house occupied by sixteen people,<!--There were 17 residents but one was out at the time of the murder (Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 76)--> none of whom had seen or heard anything at the time of the murder.<ref>Coroner Baxter quoted in Marriott, p. 71</ref> The passage through the house to the back-yard was not locked, as it was frequented by the residents at all hours of the day, and the front door was wide open when the body was discovered.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 71</ref> Richardson said that he had often seen strangers, both men and women, in the passage of the house.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 78</ref> Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]], the police surgeon, described the body as he saw it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street:\n{{quote|text=The left arm was placed across the left breast. The legs were drawn up, the feet resting on the ground, and the knees turned outwards. The face was swollen and turned on the right side. The tongue protruded between the front teeth, but not beyond the lips. The tongue was evidently much swollen. The front teeth were perfect as far as the first molar, top and bottom and very fine teeth they were. The body was terribly mutilated&nbsp;... the stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but was evidently commencing. He noticed that the throat was dissevered deeply; that the incision through the skin were jagged and reached right round the neck&nbsp;... On the wooden [[Palisade|paling]] between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.&nbsp;...\n\nThe instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning. He should say it was not tied on after the throat was cut.<ref>''The Times'', 14 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 85\u201388</ref>}}\n[[File:Annie Chapman mortuary photo.jpg|thumb|160px|Mortuary photograph of Annie Chapman]]\nChapman's throat had been cut from left to right so deeply the bones of her [[vertebral column]] bore striations,<ref>''Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-848-68522-2}} p. 158</ref> and she had been [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh\u2014plus her [[small intestine]]s\u2014being removed and placed above her right shoulder.<ref>''The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-79040-9}} pp. 55-56</ref> The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. Chapman's protruding tongue and swollen face led Dr Phillips to think that she may have been asphyxiated with the handkerchief around her neck before her throat was cut.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 72; Fido, p. 34</ref> As there was no blood trail leading to the yard, he was certain that she was killed where she was found. He concluded that she suffered from a long-standing lung disease, that the victim was sober at the time of death, and had not consumed alcoholic beverages for at least some hours before it.<ref>Phillips's inquest testimony quoted in Marriott, pp. 53\u201354</ref> Phillips was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6\u20138&nbsp;inches (15\u201320&nbsp;cm) long.<ref>Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71\u201372; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 67\u201368, 87; Marriott, pp. 26\u201329; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.<ref>Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> As her body was not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organ was removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could then sell as surgical specimens.<ref>Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> In his summing up, Coroner Baxter raised the possibility that Chapman was murdered deliberately to obtain the uterus, on the basis that an American had made enquiries at a London medical school for the purchase of such organs.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 89; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 106; Fido, p. 35; Marriott, p. 73</ref> ''[[The Lancet]]'' rejected Baxter's suggestion scathingly, pointed out \"certain improbabilities and absurdities\", and said it was \"a grave error of judgement\".<ref>''The Lancet'', 29 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 89\u201390</ref> The ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' was similarly dismissive, and reported that the physician who requested the samples was a highly reputable doctor, unnamed, who had left the country 18 months before the murder.<ref>''British Medical Journal'', 6 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 92 and Fido, p. 36</ref> Baxter dropped the theory and never referred to it again.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 90; Fido, p. 36</ref> The ''Chicago Tribune'' claimed the American doctor was from Philadelphia,<ref>''Chicago Tribune'', 7 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 93</ref> and author [[Philip Sugden (historian)|Philip Sugden]] later speculated that the man in question was the notorious [[Francis Tumblety]].<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 93</ref>\n\nDr Phillips's estimate of the time of death (4:30 a.m. or before) contradicted the testimony of the witnesses Richardson, Long and Cadosch, which placed the murder later. Victorian methods of estimating time of death, such as measuring body temperature, were crude, and Phillips highlighted at the inquest that the body could have cooled more quickly than normally expected.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 73\u201374</ref>\n[[File:Wanted poster.jpg|160px|thumb|right|alt=Ghastly murder in the East End.

Ship's cook William Henry Piggott was detained after being found in possession of a blood-stained shirt while making misogynist remarks. He claimed that he had been bitten by a woman, and the blood was his.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 83</ref> He was investigated, cleared and released.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 89</ref> Swiss butcher Jacob Isenschmidt matched the description of a blood-stained man seen acting strangely on the morning of the murder by a public house landlady, Mrs Fiddymont. His distinctive appearance included a large ginger moustache, and he had a history of mental illness. He was detained in a mental asylum. German hairdresser Charles Ludwig was arrested after he attempted to stab a man at a coffee stall shortly after attacking a prostitute. Isenschmidt and Ludwig were exonerated after another murder was committed while they were in custody.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Other suspects named in the police files and contemporary newspapers include Friedrich Schumacher, pedlar Edward McKenna, apothecary and mental patient Oswald Puckridge, and insane medical student John Sanders, but there was no evidence against any of them.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 80, 84, 88</ref>\n\nEdward Stanley was eliminated as a suspect as his alibis for the nights of two of the murders were confirmed. On 30\u201331 August, when Mary Ann Nichols was killed, he was on duty with the Hampshire militia in [[Gosport]], and on the night of Chapman's murder he was at his lodgings.<ref>Report by Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], 19 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 64</ref>\n\n==Funeral==\nAnnie Chapman was buried shortly after 9:00 a.m. on 14 September 1888 in a service paid for by her family. She was laid to rest in a communal grave within Manor Park Cemetery, [[Forest Gate]], east London. At the request of Chapman's family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] used throughout the service, and only the [[undertaker]], police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Resultingly, her family members were the only mourners to attend the service.<ref>''Ripper Notes: Death in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-0-975-91295-9}} p. 94</ref>\n\nA hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker H. Smith travelled to the Whitechapel Mortuary in Montague Street to collect Chapman's body at 7:00 a.m. Her body was placed in an [[elm]] coffin draped in black and was then driven to a Spitalfields undertaker named Harry Hawes, who arranged the funeral. Chapman's relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery. Her coffin bore the words \"Annie Chapman, died Sept. 8, 1888, aged 48 years.\"<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', 15 September 1888, p. 3</ref>\n\nThe grave of Annie Chapman no longer exists.
