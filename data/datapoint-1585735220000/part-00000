Both robbers were killed, 12 police officers and eight civilians were injured, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\nAt 9:17&nbsp;am, Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu entered and robbed the North Hollywood [[Bank of America]] branch. The two robbers were confronted by LAPD officers when they exited the bank and a [[shootout]] between the officers and robbers ensued. The robbers attempted to flee the scene, Phillips on foot and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu in their getaway vehicle, while continuing to exchange fire with the officers. The shootout continued onto a residential street adjacent to the bank until Phillips, mortally wounded, succumbed to a self-inflicted gunshot wound; M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu was incapacitated by officers three blocks away and subsequently bled to death before the arrival of paramedics more than an hour later.\n\nPhillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu are believed to have robbed at least two other banks using similar methods by taking control of the entire bank and firing weapons illegally-modified to fire fully-automatic, chambered for [[intermediate cartridge]]s for control and entry past 'bullet-proof' security doors, and were suspects in two [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] robberies.<ref>[http://www.northhollywoodshootout.com/timeline.html Timeline - 'Bears In The Beehive'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923003825/http://www.northhollywoodshootout.com/timeline.html|date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nStandard issue sidearms carried by most local patrol officers at the time were [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]] pistols or [[.38 Special]] revolvers; some patrol cars were also equipped with a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun. Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu carried [[Type 56 assault rifle|Norinco Type 56 S-1s]] (an [[AK-47]] variant), a [[Bushmaster XM-15|Bushmaster XM15 Dissipator]] with high-capacity [[drum magazine]], and a [[Heckler & Koch HK41#HK91|Heckler & Koch HK-91]] rifle, all of which had been illegally-modified to make them fire fully-automatic, as well as a [[Beretta 92#92FS|Beretta 92FS]] pistol. The robbers wore mostly homemade, heavy plated [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from handgun rounds and shotgun pellets fired by the responding officers. A police [[SWAT]] team eventually arrived bearing sufficient firepower, and they commandeered an armored truck to evacuate the wounded. Several officers also appropriated [[AR-15]] and other semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to [[militarization of police|upgrade their firepower]] in preparation for similar situations in the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=How the North Hollywood Shootout Changed Patrol Arsenals|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/Articles/Print/Story/2012/02/How-the-North-Hollywood-Shootout-Changed-Patrol-Rifles.aspx|publisher=Policemag.com|access-date=June 14, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702091610/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/articles/print/story/2012/02/how-the-north-hollywood-shootout-changed-patrol-rifles.aspx|archivedate=July 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to the large number of injuries, rounds fired, weapons used, and overall length of the shootout, it is regarded as one of the most intense gun battles in U.S. police history.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/44893/44-minutes/ |title=44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout |author=Cynthia Fuchs |date=June 1, 2003 |magazine=PopMatters |access-date=September 29, 2007 |quote=The legal and cultural fallout of the crime had to do with just how much firepower the cops should be carrying, if outlaws find it so easy to purchase AK-47s at gun shows. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015163522/http://popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/44893/44-minutes/ |archivedate=October 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Combined, the two men had fired approximately 1,100 rounds in total, while approximately 650 rounds were fired by police.<ref name=\"History\">''Shootout!''; The History Channel; Viewed July 8, 2008.</ref> Another estimate is that a total of nearly 2,000 rounds were fired.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\n==Backgrounds==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Emil M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu, 1982.png\n|caption1=Matasareanu in 1982, as a teenager\n| width1    = 130\n|image2=Larry Eugene Phillips, Sr. and Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr.png\n|caption2=Phillips as a child, with his father\n| width2    = 170\n}}This is not true, here is the link to the actual newspaper article published the day after this event.

To come up with this timeframe, Phillips had used a radio scanner to monitor police transmissions prior to the robbery.<ref name=\"criticalrob13\" /> As the two were walking in, they were spotted by two LAPD officers, Loren Farrell and Martin Perello, who were driving down Laurel Canyon in a patrol car.

The robbers forced assistant manager John Villigrana to open the vault. Villigrana obliged and began to fill the robbers' money bag. However, due to a change in the bank's delivery schedule, the vault contained significantly less than the $750,000 the gunmen had expected. Phillips, enraged at this development, argued with Villigrana and demanded more. In an apparent show of frustration, Phillips then fired a full drum magazine of 75 rounds into the bank's safe, destroying much of the remaining money. Phillips then attempted to open the bank's ATM, but due to a change in policies, the branch manager no longer had access to the money inside. Before leaving, the robbers locked the hostages in the bank vault. In the end, the two left with $303,305 and three [[dye pack]]s which later exploded, ruining the money they stole.<ref name=\"critical\" />\n\n===Shootout===\n[[File:Nhshootout.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the area around the Bank of America and events during the shoot-out.]]\nOutside, the first-responding officers heard gunfire from the bank and made another radio call for additional units before taking cover behind their patrol car, weapons trained on the bank doors. While the robbers were still inside, more patrol and detective units arrived and took strategic positions at all four corners of the bank, effectively surrounding it. At approximately 9:24&nbsp;am, Phillips exited through the north doorway and after spotting a police cruiser {{convert|200|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} away, opened fire for several minutes, wounding seven officers and three civilians. He also fired at an LAPD helicopter which was surveying above, forcing it to withdraw to a safer distance.

Police likely shot Phillips and his rifle with their handguns while Phillips was still firing and taking cover near the four vehicles adjacent to the North wall of the bank (gray Honda Civic, Ford Explorer, white Acura Legend, and Chevrolet Celebrity). One location that Officer Zielenski of Valley Traffic Division used for cover was the Del Taco restaurant West wall, 351 feet from Phillips. Officer Zielenski fired 86 9mm rounds at Phillips and may have hit Phillips at least once. The other location that proved advantageous for the LAPD was the back yard of 6641 Agnes Avenue. A cinder block wall provided cover for detectives who shot at and may have struck Phillips with 9mm rounds from their pistols. Detective Bancroft fired 17 rounds and Detective Harley fired between 15 and 24 rounds at Phillips from a distance of approximately 55 feet.

They were armed with [[AR-15]]s, and wore running shoes and shorts under their body armor, as they had been on an exercise run when they received the call.

Phillips retrieved the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the getaway vehicle, he was hit in the shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few more shots with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91 and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu drove down the road.<ref name=\"critical\" />\n\nAt 9:52&nbsp;am, Phillips turned east on Archwood Street and took cover behind a parked semi-truck where he continued to fire at the police until his rifle jammed.<ref name=\"enn\">LAPD Shoot-Out With Bank Robbers.</ref> Unable to clear the jam, he dropped the rifle and drew a Beretta 92FS pistol, which he began firing.

Officers across the street continued to shoot Phillips' body several times while he was on the ground. After the firing had stopped, officers in the area surrounded Phillips, handcuffed him, and removed his ski mask.{{Citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nM\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu's vehicle was rendered inoperable after two of its tires were shot out and the windshield covered in bullet holes.<ref name=\"critical\" /> At 9:56&nbsp;am, he attempted to [[carjack]] a yellow 1963 [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)|Jeep Gladiator]] on Archwood by shooting at the driver, who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, but was unable to operate the Jeep due to the driver engaging the [[kill switch|electrical kill switch]] before fleeing. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, a patrol car driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped on the opposite side of the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped.

Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu carried [[Type 56 assault rifle|Norinco Type 56 S-1s]] (an [[AK-47]] variant), a [[Bushmaster XM-15|Bushmaster XM15 Dissipator]] with high-capacity [[drum magazine]], and a [[Heckler & Koch HK41#HK91|Heckler & Koch HK-91]] rifle, all of which had been illegally-modified to make them fire fully-automatic, as well as a [[Beretta 92#92FS|Beretta 92FS]] pistol. The robbers wore mostly homemade, heavy plated [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from handgun rounds and shotgun pellets fired by the responding officers.

The robbers forced assistant manager John Villigrana to open the vault. Villigrana obliged and began to fill the robbers' money bag. However, due to a change in the bank's delivery schedule, the vault contained significantly less than the $750,000 the gunmen had expected. Phillips, enraged at this development, argued with Villigrana and demanded more. In an apparent show of frustration, Phillips then fired a full drum magazine of 75 rounds into the bank's safe, destroying much of the remaining money. Phillips then attempted to open the bank's ATM, but due to a change in policies, the branch manager no longer had access to the money inside. Before leaving, the robbers locked the hostages in the bank vault.

Police likely shot Phillips and his rifle with their handguns while Phillips was still firing and taking cover near the four vehicles adjacent to the North wall of the bank (gray Honda Civic, Ford Explorer, white Acura Legend, and Chevrolet Celebrity). One location that Officer Zielenski of Valley Traffic Division used for cover was the Del Taco restaurant West wall, 351 feet from Phillips. Officer Zielenski fired 86 9mm rounds at Phillips and may have hit Phillips at least once. The other location that proved advantageous for the LAPD was the back yard of 6641 Agnes Avenue. A cinder block wall provided cover for detectives who shot at and may have struck Phillips with 9mm rounds from their pistols. Detective Bancroft fired 17 rounds and Detective Harley fired between 15 and 24 rounds at Phillips from a distance of approximately 55 feet.

The SWAT team arrived 18 minutes after the shooting had begun. They were armed with [[AR-15]]s, and wore running shoes and shorts under their body armor, as they had been on an exercise run when they received the call.

Phillips retrieved the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the getaway vehicle, he was hit in the shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few more shots with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91 and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu drove down the road.<ref name=\"critical\" />\n\nAt 9:52&nbsp;am, Phillips turned east on Archwood Street and took cover behind a parked semi-truck where he continued to fire at the police until his rifle jammed.<ref name=\"enn\">LAPD Shoot-Out With Bank Robbers.</ref> Unable to clear the jam, he dropped the rifle and drew a Beretta 92FS pistol, which he began firing.

Officers across the street continued to shoot Phillips' body several times while he was on the ground.

However, [[aramid]] body armor worn by Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu covered all of their vitals (except their heads) while providing more bullet resistance than standard-issue police [[Kevlar]] vests, enabling them to absorb pistol bullets and shotgun pellets, while M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu's chest armor, thanks to a metal trauma plate, successfully withstood a hit from a SWAT officer's AR-15. The service pistols carried by the first responding officers had insufficient range and relatively poor accuracy, and additionally they were pinned down by the robbers' high rate of fire, making it difficult to attempt a head shot.
