Using a natural genome as a template minimized the potential sources of failure. Several differences are present in ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' JCVI-syn1.0 relative to the reference genome, notably an ''E.coli'' transposon IS1 (an infection from the 10kb stage) and an 85bp duplication, as well as elements required for propagation in yeast and residues from restriction sites.<ref group=\"a\" name=\"synthcell\"/>\n\nThere has been controversy over whether JCVI-syn1.0 is a true synthetic organism. While the genome was synthesized chemically in many pieces, it was constructed to match the parent genome closely and transplanted into the cytoplasm of a natural cell.  DNA alone cannot create a viable cell: proteins and RNAs are needed to read the DNA, and [[lipid membranes]] are required to compartmentalize the DNA and [[cytoplasm]].
