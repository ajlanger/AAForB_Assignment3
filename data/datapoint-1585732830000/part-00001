The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft is capable to dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft is capable to dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

The full duration static fire test of Crew Dragon's launch escape system took place at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at SpaceX's Landing zone 1 at 20:08 UTC. The test was successful, showing that the modifications made to the vehicle to prevent a failure like the one that happened 20 April were successful. The vehicle used for this ground test will also be used for the following in-flight abort test.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/13/spacex-fires-up-crew-dragon-thrusters-in-key-test-after-april-explosion/</ref>\n\nSome of the modifications are:\n\n* Replacement of the valves with [[burst disc]]s: Unlike valves, burst discs are designed for single use. \n* Adding of flaps on each SuperDracos in order to reseal those thrusters prior to splashdown in the Ocean, preventing water intrusion and make Crew Dragon far easier to refurbish and reuse, also preventing Dragon from sinking.<ref>https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-fires-redesigned-crew-dragon-superdraco-flaps/</ref>\n\n===In-Flight Abort Test===\n[[File:KSC-20200119-PH-AWG04 0008.jpg|thumb|Liftoff of Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test.]]\n\nThe Crew Dragon In-flight abort test was launched on 19 January 2020 at 15:30 UTC from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]] on a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] trajectory to conduct a separation and abort scenario in the [[troposphere]] at [[transonic]] velocities shortly after passing through [[Max q|max Q]], where the vehicle experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure. The Dragon 2 used its [[SuperDraco]] abort engines to push itself away from the Falcon 9 after an intentional premature engine cutoff. The spacecraft followed its suborbital trajectory to apogee, at which point the spacecraft's trunk was jettisoned. The smaller [[SpaceX Draco|Draco]] engines were then used to orient the vehicle for the descent. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment, and landing. Dragon 2 splashed down at 15:38:54 UTC just off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-complete-final-major-flight-test-of-crew-spacecraft</ref> The test objective was to demonstrate the ability to safely move away from the ascending rocket under the most challenging atmospheric conditions of the flight trajectory, imposing the worst structural stress of a real flight on the rocket and spacecraft.<ref name=nsf20140828/> The abort test was performed using a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket with a fully fueled second stage with a mass simulator replacing the [[SpaceX Merlin|Merlin]] engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/space-exploration-technologies/second-spacex-crew-flight-ordered-nasa/|title=Second SpaceX Crew Flight Ordered by NASA|work=Spaceflight Insider|first=Derek|last=Richardson|date=30 July 2016|access-date=9 August 2016|quote=Currently, the first uncrewed test of the spacecraft is expected to launch in May 2017.
