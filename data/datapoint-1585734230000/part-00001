In 2007, Kuya [[Daniel Razon]]'s BMPI acquired the main technical and TV production operations of UNTV and was launched as a public service channel, a first in Philippine TV history.\n\nIn 2012, MCGI acquired a majority stake in [[Information Broadcast Unlimited]] Inc. through BMPI.\n\nIn 2013, UNTV ceased using its old analog transmitter tower in Crestview Heights Subdivision, Brgy.

Allegedly, some INC members staying at Sofitel requested removal of UNTV which was denied by INC, a known doctrinal opponent of ADD, a program aired in UNTV.\n\nOn August 10, 2014, UNTV-BMPI formally relaunched DWNU 107.5 as [[DWNU|107.5 Wish FM]] with a free concert featuring [[Original Pilipino Music|OPM]] singers at the WTC and UNTV's newest theme song entitled \"Maaasahan Mo\" sung by Shane Velasco and Beverly Caimen.\n\nFrom August 25 to 26, 2015, as part of UNTV's 11th anniversary celebration, a two-day event was held including the opening of the basketball league of Philippine government agencies, the [[UNTV Cup Season 4]] at the SM [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Public Service Expo and the 2nd UNTV Rescue Summit at the [[SMX Convention Center]].

[[DWAO-TV]] is one of very few [[NTSC]]-System M stations in the world that broadcast on Ultra High Frequency (UHF) [[Channel 37]]. Its studios are located at the UNTV Building, 907 Brgy. Philam, EDSA [[Quezon City]] and La Verdad Christian College - Caloocan Building, 351 EDSA, Brgy. Bagong Barrio West, [[Caloocan City]] and transmitter located at Emerald Hills, Sumulong Highway in [[Antipolo]], [[Rizal province|Rizal]]. The 16-storey [[UNTV Broadcast Center]] along EDSA Philam is currently under construction to serve as its new headquarters by 2019.\n\nIt is known for its broadcast of ''[[Ang Dating Daan]]'' (ADD), the longest-running religious program in the Philippines, hosted by radio and [[televangelist]] [[Bro. Eli Soriano]], the Overall Servant to the [[Members Church of God International]] (MCGI).\n\nUNTV's public service programs and free services are manned by BMPI chairman and CEO, [[Daniel Razon]]. Razon is also known as Ang Dating Daan co-host and MCGI's Assistant Overall Servant.\n\n==Network Profile==\n=== PBC Blocktime ===\nUNTV Manila and Cebu were part of a joint-venture between [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]] (PBC) majority owned by Alfredo \"Atom\" Henares and [[Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International]] (BMPI) Inc. led by Daniel Razon.<ref name=\"bitagmedia.com\"/> BMPI is the broadcast arm of [[Members Church of God International]] (MCGI) in the Philippines.\n\nPBC holds the broadcast license in [[Mega Manila]] and Cebu, the radio frequency spectrum (UHF) necessary for broadcasting in these key populated areas. The owners entrusted Razon and Soriano with the network's operations, programming and marketing through BMPI.\n\nBro. Eli Soriano during their weekly thanksgiving service mentioned the 50-year exclusive lease agreement among PBC, BMPI and MCGI primarily to ensure continuous broadcast in Mega Manila through [[blocktime]] programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techthetruth.wordpress.com/2016/12/09/ang-dating-daan-marks-36-years-of-fruitful-evangelization-by-giving-8000-bibles-for-free-doing-public-service/|title=Ang Dating Daan Marks 36 Years of Fruitful Evangelization by Giving 8,000 Bibles for Free, Doing Public Service|date=9 December 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== MCGI's Own Radio and TV Network ===\nIn 2012, MCGI saw the fulfillment of Bro.
