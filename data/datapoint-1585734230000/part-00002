It serves as the new transmitter facility for flagship stations [[DWAO-TV]] ([[UNTV News and Rescue]]) and [[DWNU]], with broadcast licenses owned by the stations founder [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n==History==\nIn July 2013, BMPI Chairman and CEO [[Daniel Razon]] announced the network's plan of upgrading its facilities, in preparation for its transition from analog to the Japanese [[ISDB|ISDB-T]] digital system. The construction of the new transmitter began in early 2013, completed before the end of the year and became fully operational in January 2014. Upon the launch, the tower replaced its old transmitter under a [[lease agreement]] at Crestview Subdivision in Antipolo, Rizal since 2001 (which PBC sold its site to [[Nine Media Corporation]] together with [[Radio Philippines Network|Radio Philippines Network, Inc.]], all an affiliate of [[Aliw Broadcasting Corporation]] in 2017 to use RPN's [[Digital terrestrial television]] broadcast in Metro Manila and nearby provinces). In July 2014, when BMPI took over the management of PBC's DWNU 107.5 FM, DWNU also shifted its transmitter to the UNTV Tower.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Transmitter===\nUNTV acquired its new analog and digital broadcast equipment from Digital Multimedia Technologies (DMT) System Engineering Solutions (SyES). SyES has been in the manufacturing industry for over 30 years with headquarters in [[Lissone]], [[Italy]]. The {{convert|328|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tower uses highly efficient SyES complete antenna system (COEL brand) to produce a wide coverage of UHF analog and digital TV reception in [[Metro Manila]], [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Cavite]] and [[Rizal]].  with a 60,000-[[watt]] [[Transmitted power output|TPO]] in UHF 37 (analog) and up to a maximum of 10,000-watt TPO in UHF 38 (digital). It serves as the originating transmitter for its relay stations in the provinces.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, UNTV began<ref>https://www.facebook.com/DTVPilipinas/posts/982316968460514</ref> its simulcast test broadcast on UHF channel 38 (617.143&nbsp;MHz) with two standard definition (SD) channels, one high-definition (HD) channel and one [[1seg]] channel. UNTV's low-powered DTV test broadcast can be received in Metro Manila and nearby provinces using ISDB-T set top boxes<ref>http://sci.com.ph/digitaltvbox/</ref>, LED TV sets and mobile devices with built-in ISDB-T tuners. In a DTV signal test<ref>http://www.starmobile.ph/blog/starmobile-concludes-metro-manila-dtv-signal-testing/</ref> conducted by Starmobile last April 2015, UNTV was present in eight out of 14 locations in Metro Manila with decent signal strength of three (3) up to the maximum of four (4) signal bars.\n\nFor FM, BMPI transferred the 25-kilowatt Nautel NV30 FM transmitter, acquired in 2010 by PBC for its former partnership with [[Win Radio|ZimZam Management]] of Mr. Manuelito Luzon, from Crestview Subdivision to Emerald Hills when it acquired the operations of 107.5&nbsp;FM in 2014. Win Radio meanwhile transferred its Manila station to [[Mabuhay Broadcasting System]]'s [[DWKY]] 91.5 FM, which transmits programs to an in-house facility at the [[Summit One Tower]] in Mandaluyong. Wish FM initially suffered a poor signal reception during its grand launching but later on, it dramatically improved its signal reception in [[Mega Manila]] after a series of technical adjustments on its transmission settings.\n\nThe transmitter is being controlled from UNTV headquarters in Quezon City via [[studio/transmitter link]] (STL) facility.\n\n===Transmitter facility===\nA concrete transmitter control room was built on the ground beneath the tower. It houses the transmitter equipment for UNTV, ADDTV and Wish FM, power supply, cooling system and backup generator sets. There is also a satellite uplink and downlink facility inside the compound.\n\n==See also==\n*[[UNTV News and Rescue]]\n*[[DWAO-TV]]\n*[[DWUN]]\n*[[DWNU]]\n*[[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]]\n*[[Members Church of God International]]\n*[[List of famous transmission sites]]\n*[[List of tallest towers in the world]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{UNTV}}\n\n{{Media facilities in the Philippines}}\n\n{{Members Church of God International}}\n\n{{coord missing|Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:Members Church of God International]]\n[[Category:Towers completed in 2014]]\n[[Category:Broadcast transmitters]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Antipolo]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox building\n|name               = UNTV Transmitter Tower\n|image              = \n|image_size         = 250px\n|caption            = \n|coordinates        = \n|status             = \n|start_date         = 2012\n|location           = [[Antipolo]], [[Philippines]]\n|completion_date    = 2013\n|opening            = 2014\n|cost               = \n|building_type      = [[Communications tower]]\n|floor_area         = \n|antenna_spire      = \n|structural_engineer=\n|architect          = \n|main_contractor    =  \n|developer          = \n|owner              = Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International, Inc.
