On October 23, 1953, a Treaty of Amity and Association was signed and France committed to defend Laos against the advance of communist troops.  A garrison assigned under the command of General [[Henri Navarre]] \u2013 whose mission was to prevent any Vi\u1ec7t Minh infiltration to Laos \u2013 was implanted in a strategic area, in West [[Tonkin]], close to the Laotian border, where were some important runways connecting Luang Prabang to Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu Basin.\n\nBut May 7, 1954, French soldiers suffered a bitter military setback and Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu's entrenched camp fell into the hands of the People's Army of Vietnam, commanded by General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p. Whereupon, a conference was organized on July 20 in Geneva (Switzerland) to end hostilities between the French Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, ending eight years of war in Indochina. By the same occasion, the independence of Laos and Cambodia was reaffirmed.\n\nAt the conference, the Kingdom of Laos delegation was composed of Phoui Sananikone (minister of Foreign Affairs \u2013 leader), Kou Voravong (Minister of Defense \u2013 vice-leader) and eight members of Parliament. The members of Pathet Lao including Chao [[Souphanouvong]], who carried North-Vietnamese passports, were integrated into the Vi\u1ec7t Minh delegation.\n\nThe final declaration of the Geneva Agreements provided for Laos:\n#Recognition of the independence and total sovereignty of Laos.\n#Recognition of Vientiane Royal Government as the legal government of Laos.\n#Recognition of the \u00ab Fighting Units of the Pathet Lao \u00bb grouped in the Xam Neua and Phongsali Provinces, awaiting for their integration into the Royal Army after political settlement through free general elections planned in 1955, under the supervision of the International Commission Control (CIC).\n#Withdrawal of the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military troops of the territory, except for the French instructors placed at the disposal of the Laotian Army.\n#Principle of neutrality which prohibited membership in military alliances and introduction of troops and foreign weapons on Laotian territory.\n\n[[File:Ap540721012_geneva_conference_1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Palais de Nations, Geneva, July 21, 1954, after the signing of the Indo China Truce Agreements. Left to right: the Soviet delegation and the British. Next table: the Laotian, French and Vietnam delegations, and with backs to the camera, the Cambodia delegation and, left, the United States delegation.]]\n\nWhereas all details of the cease-fire in Vietnam were settled, the agreement #3 which was equivalent to a recognition of the [[Pathet Lao]] as an official authority through its \u00ab Fighting Units \u00bb, divided the royal representatives of the Laotian delegation and extended negotiations till late in the night of July 20. Shortly after midnight, despite the opinion of his delegation's leader, [[Phoui Sananikone]], Kou Voravong finally granted to sign the final declaration, thereby closing the conference on July 21, 1954.\n\nIn spite of significant concessions of the [[Pathet Lao]], politically -[recognition of the Government of Vientiane]- as well as military -[withdrawals of the armed forces of the liberated zones and their grouping in [[Xam Neua]] (Houaphanh) and [[Phongsali]] Provinces] \u2013 their official establishment next to the Lao Royal Government pending elections was far from eliciting unanimity. This was particularly true for the U.S. government which refused to sign and to apply the [[Geneva Agreements]], considering that they handed a too large victory to the Indochinese Liberation Movements, headed by the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]], and supported by China and the Soviet Union. The spectrum of the Korean War just ended is still too present, that's why Washington's policy goal from now on, was to challenge the results of such agreements.\n\nOn September 8, 1954, at the initiative of the United States, a military organization [[SEATO]] was created. Equivalent of [[NATO]] in Southeast Asia, its official goal was to form a \"quarantine line\" against Communist expansion. It was decided by the authority that [[Cambodia]], and Laos, considering their strategical position, belonged automatically to its protection zone. The defense minister Kou Voravong, supporter of strict application of the Geneva Agreements on the principle of neutrality prohibiting any military alliance, declined the protection of his country by the SEATO and refused to ratify the treaty, thereby blocking the American policy of containment towards the Communist expansion in Asia.\n\nUpon returning of the Geneva delegation, conflicts appeared within the Government. At the same period, rumors of coup by revolutionary conspiracies supporting Chao [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] circulated, creating strong troubles in the country. These extreme tensions reached the summit, when two months later, an attack was committed on September 18, during a reception at [[Phoui Sananikone]]'s residence, one of the delegates at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Present among the dinner guests, hit by a bullet in the back, Kou Voravong died one half an hour later at the Mahosot Hospital (\u0ec2\u0eae\u0e87\u0e9e\u0e8d\u0eb2\u0e9a\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ea1\u0eb0\u0ec2\u0eab\u0eaa\u0ebb\u0e94), in Vientiane.\n\n== Assassination and political consequences ==\n\n=== September 18th attack ===\n\n==== Circumstances and facts ====\nThe attack occurred at approximately 22:15, at Phoui Sananikone's, an official residence nearby the Voravong family's. The attackers launched three grenades by one of the windows on the ground floor, in the dining room. They fired three or four pistol shots and then run away. Kou voravong, sitting with his back to the window, was directly hit by a bullet which came in by the kidney and out through the navel, after cutting the vena cava and crossed the liver and intestines. His dead is declared shortly after admission to hospital. A dozen people were injured by the explosion of the grenades, slightly for most of them.\n\nFifteen minutes later, when the police arrived, it was total confusion: in the panic, people had trampled the crime scene and destroyed evidences. According to witnesses, two men flew away behind the house through the gardens, in the direction of the swamps Muang Noy (\u0ec0\u0ea1\u0eb7\u0ead\u0e87\u0e99\u0ec9\u0ead\u0e8d), located 20&nbsp;km around Vientiane. Two suspects, Oudom Louksourine (\u0ead\u0eb8\u0e94\u0ebb\u0ea1 \u0ea5\u0eb8\u0e81\u0eaa\u0eb8\u0ea3\u0eb4\u0e99) and Mi (\u0ea1\u0eb5) were formally recognized, police officers, therefore, set off in pursuit. Even wounded in the arms and legs, Oudom and Mi managed to escape. Supported by local complicity, they succeed in reaching Nong Khai (thai: \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e32\u0e22), on the other side of the Mekong River.\n\nAccording to the police investigations, one of bullets fired by Oudom Louksourine reached Kou Voravong and caused his death. Oudom was a dangerous and notorious gangster, who confessed to have committed about fifteen assassinations. Imprisoned since 1950, he escaped in 1954 and with Mi -his partner in crime- joined a band of bandits established in [[Isan]] region, northeast Thailand, whose leader named Bounkong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e81\u0ead\u0e87), a veteran Lao Issara and faithful follower of Chao Phetsarath.\n\nThis band of gangsters was hostile to France and ploted against the Royal Government. It was partly formed by soldiers who have deserted the Chinaimo camp, located near the capital. The conspiracy's members are gathered and hosted by the Thai police under the order of Colonel Praseuth (thai : \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e10), in Nong Khai, a border city located only 20&nbsp;km from Vientiane. It appeared clearly that the Thai police, with or without the approval of the Government, supported the plot of Chinaimo which projected to reverse the Souvanna Phouma's government in order to return power to Chao Phetsarath, exiled in Bangkok since 1946. In addition, Thai authority appeared to have an ambiguous policy towards this case: they protected the conspirators of the Bounkong's band at the beginning, before eliminated most of them. They have constantly refused to extradite Oudom Louksourine, who would still sentenced to death in absentia for Kou Voravong's assassination by the Court of Vientiane in July 1959. At that time, he was captain in the Thai police.\n\n==== Various theories ====\nIf there was no doubt about the identity of the one who pulled the trigger, various theories about the person who was behind the crime were advanced by some people, depending on their political, ideological or family affiliations. They were mainly three:\n\n#The plot headed by Bounkong, supported by Thai separatists, sympathizers of both Vi\u1ec7t Minh revolutionists and of Chao Phetsarath, was firmly anti-French.

His son Boutsabong, would have informed the conspirators of the reception at Sananikone's, which had been although decided in the afternoon. Bong Souvannavong was then arrested and jailed on October 6. According to some conspirators testimony, this attack would be aimed at [[Phoui Sananikone]], who was accused of the anti-Pathet Lao attitude and not having resisted Western pressures on the [[Geneva Agreements]]. For some of them, Kou Voravong's death would be first of all an error, which was then exploited to threaten pro-French government members,<ref name=\"JD-China\u00efmo78,81,107\">{{cite book |language=fr |author=[[Jean Deuve]] |title=Le complot de China\u00efmo|pages=78, 81, 107}}</ref> and for others, it would be a fatal consequence of his intense anti-subversive activity when he was Minister of the Interior,<ref name=\"LoG-ID\">{{cite web|language=en |url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/20.htm|title=Initial Difficulties|website=U.S.Library of Congress|access-date=27 November 2015 }}</ref> and for still others, that could be an extreme reaction of the French Government to his active anti-feudal militancy for a Laotian led administration. \n#Immediately after the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO)'s signing in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the Thai Army was deployed in the North and on the East Bank of the Mekong River, along the Laotian borders.

Kou Voravong's refusal to join the military organization blocked any US intervention and thus hindered the \"containment\" policy of which Thailand was part of. During a National Assembly session, Kou Voravong revealed that strong pressures were put on the two Laotian delegation's leaders by the United States so that they refused to sign the agreement's part concerning Laos at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. [[Phoui Sananikone]] would have accepted a one million bribe not to affix his signature. In his speech, Kou Voravong also revealed that the right-wing forces had planned the [[Pathet Lao]]'s troops suppression, as soon as they were withdrawn from [[Houaphan Province|Samneua]] and [[Phongsaly Province]], as set out in the [[Geneva Agreements]]. And lastly, nine days before his murder, he was preparing a meeting between Chao [[Souvanna Phouma]] \u2013 the Lao Royal Government's chief \u2013 and his half-brother Chao [[Souphanouvong]] \u2013 the [[Pathet Lao]]'s leader \u2013 for the discussions in order to organize the free elections envisaged by these same agreements. For some circles, particularly in the Communist left-wing, Kou Voravong would have become a target of the Lao-Thai right-wing and the [[CIA]]: the main \"beneficiaries\" of his death being the Thai and American governments who considered the [[Geneva Agreements]] as a serious concession from France to communist bloc countries.<ref>{{cite book |language=fr |author1=Sav\u00e8ng Phinith|title=Histoire du Pays Lao|pages=149}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|language=fr |author1=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=Laos \u2013 Encore un \"domino\" de tomb\u00e9 |newspaper=L'unit\u00e9 |number=159 |date= 23 May 1975 |pp=20\u201321 |url=http://62.210.214.184/unite/u-result_frame.php?catalogueID=5098&Rubrique=Laos }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |language=en |author=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=The Furtive War |pages=A Fateful Assassination |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/burchett/1963/the-furtive-war/ch09.htm |access-date=20 September 2015 }}</ref>\n#This affair confronted the three most influential rival families in Laos: the Sananikones, the Souvannavongs and the Voravongs. This was typical in Lao political circles where conflicts of families or personalities were mingled with national politics. Kou Voravong \u2013 leading supporter of the policy of \"neutrality\" \u2013 stood in opposition to the American \"anti-communist\" policy which started to find many sympathizers, and among them was [[Phoui Sananikone]]. Actually, Kou Voravong was murdered at the residence of [[Phoui Sananikone]], who shortly after became Minister of the Interior and hastily got Bong Souvannavong- a left-wing sympathizer \u2013 arrested, whom he accused of being the instigator of Chinaimo's conspiracy, and therefore to be behind the assassination. On January 5, 1955, Thai authorities arrested Oudom Louksourine in Bangkok and declared that the latter confessed to having been paid by [[Phoui Sananikone]] to kill Kou Voravong, but however refused to extradite him to Laos. The two rival families newspapers then started a violent campaign against [[Phoui Sananikone]] and the March 9, 1955, complaints for assassination was filed against him by the Voravong family at the Vientiane Court. Despite of the given judgement which concluded to dismiss the case for insufficient evidence, the resentments persisted and the charges were maintained.

A two-thirds majority was necessary for a nomination, but no major political party came to get it. A compromise was reached between the two major parties: half members of former neutralist government \u2013 pro-French, favoring the strict application of the agreements signed at Geneva \u2013 and half members of the progressive opposition \u2013 pro-American, opposed to this same agreements \u2013 knowing that neither side was intending to grant concessions to the other.

But as the independence movement was led by the Communist Party, and [[Vietnam]] was geographically close to China and not far from [[North Korea]], USA got interested in the conflict taking place in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]]. To justify their intervention, the Americans referred to the \"[[Domino theory]]\" that if Vietnam fell into the hands of the Communists, neighboring countries would follow, earned by the contagion or assaulted by military forces from Hanoi. This shift would change radically forces East/West reports in whole Asia.\n\nIn the other camp, the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]]'s victory enabled [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] to control the area of North-Laos, but [[Ho Chi Minh]] nourished a higher ambition for Indochina.

And then in the aftermath of the defeat, he took refuge in Thailand. Upon his return from exile in 1949, he joined the newly formed Lao National Army, created in March of the same year.\n\nEarly in 1950, when Bounkong and his band engaged in violent anti-government campaigns in the South of the country, Kou Voravong created the \"Pacification of Southern Laos Mission\" to combat internal subversion and border piracy. This organization whose headquarter was based in [[Pakse]], was responsible to bring together supporters, volunteers and former members of the [[Lao Issara]] movement, to form units to combat subversion and banditry. Occupied with his ministerial responsibilities in Vientiane, he entrusted the command to his cousin and brother-in-law, the young lieutenant [[Phoumi Nosavan]].\n\n[[File:Stade Kou Voravong.jpg|thumb|upright=1|entrance to Kou Voravong stadium]]\n\nConsidering that the Bounkong Band was known in the province, he got in touch with its members and proposed them negotiations so that they convinced the local insurgents to lay down arms and to adhered to the national cause.

In 1960, during the legislative election campaign of Ou (\u0ead\u0eb8) and Bounthong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e97\u0ebb\u0e87) \u2013 Kou Voravong's half-brothers \u2013 the three cousins promised to the [[Savannakhet]] population that in the event of electoral success they would pay tribute to their brother and cousin, \"the home-grown child\", a murdered rising political figure.

At the height of his career in May 1960, thanks to his relationship with [[Sarit Thanarat]] \u2013 the current Thai Prime Minister \u2013 and in association with Ou and Bounthong Voravong, he commissioned and financed a life-size statue of Kou Voravong at the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] of the Ministry of Culture of Thailand. In [[Savannakhet]], a \"Kou Voravong Stadium\" was built at the extreme north of the avenue of the same name, and the site of the statue was planned on an esplanade just at the entrance.\n\nBut the country was immersed in a civil war, itself within the context of the [[Cold War]]. In 1963, when his uncle the General [[Sarit Thanarat]] died, he lost Thailand's Government support, while on the other side, the United States opted for direct military intervention policy. At the end of January 1965, after several \"disobediences\" to the American military advisory, and following a coup against his government, whose instigator was General [[Kouprasith Abhay]], [[Phoumi Nosavan]] was forced to go into exile in Thailand with his followers and relatives.

On October 23, 1953, a Treaty of Amity and Association was signed and France committed to defend Laos against the advance of communist troops.  A garrison assigned under the command of General [[Henri Navarre]] \u2013 whose mission was to prevent any Vi\u1ec7t Minh infiltration to Laos \u2013 was implanted in a strategic area, in West [[Tonkin]], close to the Laotian border, where were some important runways connecting Luang Prabang to Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu Basin.\n\nBut May 7, 1954, French soldiers suffered a bitter military setback and Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu's entrenched camp fell into the hands of the People's Army of Vietnam, commanded by General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p. Whereupon, a conference was organized on July 20 in Geneva (Switzerland) to end hostilities between the French Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, ending eight years of war in Indochina. By the same occasion, the independence of Laos and Cambodia was reaffirmed.\n\nAt the conference, the Kingdom of Laos delegation was composed of Phoui Sananikone (minister of Foreign Affairs \u2013 leader), Kou Voravong (Minister of Defense \u2013 vice-leader) and eight members of Parliament. The members of Pathet Lao including Chao [[Souphanouvong]], who carried North-Vietnamese passports, were integrated into the Vi\u1ec7t Minh delegation.\n\nThe final declaration of the Geneva Agreements provided for Laos:\n#Recognition of the independence and total sovereignty of Laos.\n#Recognition of Vientiane Royal Government as the legal government of Laos.\n#Recognition of the \u00ab Fighting Units of the Pathet Lao \u00bb grouped in the Xam Neua and Phongsali Provinces, awaiting for their integration into the Royal Army after political settlement through free general elections planned in 1955, under the supervision of the International Commission Control (CIC).\n#Withdrawal of the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military troops of the territory, except for the French instructors placed at the disposal of the Laotian Army.\n#Principle of neutrality which prohibited membership in military alliances and introduction of troops and foreign weapons on Laotian territory.\n\n[[File:Ap540721012_geneva_conference_1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Palais de Nations, Geneva, July 21, 1954, after the signing of the Indo China Truce Agreements. Left to right: the Soviet delegation and the British. Next table: the Laotian, French and Vietnam delegations, and with backs to the camera, the Cambodia delegation and, left, the United States delegation.]]\n\nWhereas all details of the cease-fire in Vietnam were settled, the agreement #3 which was equivalent to a recognition of the [[Pathet Lao]] as an official authority through its \u00ab Fighting Units \u00bb, divided the royal representatives of the Laotian delegation and extended negotiations till late in the night of July 20. Shortly after midnight, despite the opinion of his delegation's leader, [[Phoui Sananikone]], Kou Voravong finally granted to sign the final declaration, thereby closing the conference on July 21, 1954.\n\nIn spite of significant concessions of the [[Pathet Lao]], politically -[recognition of the Government of Vientiane]- as well as military -[withdrawals of the armed forces of the liberated zones and their grouping in [[Xam Neua]] (Houaphanh) and [[Phongsali]] Provinces] \u2013 their official establishment next to the Lao Royal Government pending elections was far from eliciting unanimity. This was particularly true for the U.S. government which refused to sign and to apply the [[Geneva Agreements]], considering that they handed a too large victory to the Indochinese Liberation Movements, headed by the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]], and supported by China and the Soviet Union. The spectrum of the Korean War just ended is still too present, that's why Washington's policy goal from now on, was to challenge the results of such agreements.\n\nOn September 8, 1954, at the initiative of the United States, a military organization [[SEATO]] was created. Equivalent of [[NATO]] in Southeast Asia, its official goal was to form a \"quarantine line\" against Communist expansion. It was decided by the authority that [[Cambodia]], and Laos, considering their strategical position, belonged automatically to its protection zone. The defense minister Kou Voravong, supporter of strict application of the Geneva Agreements on the principle of neutrality prohibiting any military alliance, declined the protection of his country by the SEATO and refused to ratify the treaty, thereby blocking the American policy of containment towards the Communist expansion in Asia.\n\nUpon returning of the Geneva delegation, conflicts appeared within the Government. At the same period, rumors of coup by revolutionary conspiracies supporting Chao [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] circulated, creating strong troubles in the country. These extreme tensions reached the summit, when two months later, an attack was committed on September 18, during a reception at [[Phoui Sananikone]]'s residence, one of the delegates at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Present among the dinner guests, hit by a bullet in the back, Kou Voravong died one half an hour later at the Mahosot Hospital (\u0ec2\u0eae\u0e87\u0e9e\u0e8d\u0eb2\u0e9a\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ea1\u0eb0\u0ec2\u0eab\u0eaa\u0ebb\u0e94), in Vientiane.\n\n== Assassination and political consequences ==\n\n=== September 18th attack ===\n\n==== Circumstances and facts ====\nThe attack occurred at approximately 22:15, at Phoui Sananikone's, an official residence nearby the Voravong family's. The attackers launched three grenades by one of the windows on the ground floor, in the dining room. They fired three or four pistol shots and then run away. Kou voravong, sitting with his back to the window, was directly hit by a bullet which came in by the kidney and out through the navel, after cutting the vena cava and crossed the liver and intestines. His dead is declared shortly after admission to hospital. A dozen people were injured by the explosion of the grenades, slightly for most of them.\n\nFifteen minutes later, when the police arrived, it was total confusion: in the panic, people had trampled the crime scene and destroyed evidences. According to witnesses, two men flew away behind the house through the gardens, in the direction of the swamps Muang Noy (\u0ec0\u0ea1\u0eb7\u0ead\u0e87\u0e99\u0ec9\u0ead\u0e8d), located 20&nbsp;km around Vientiane. Two suspects, Oudom Louksourine (\u0ead\u0eb8\u0e94\u0ebb\u0ea1 \u0ea5\u0eb8\u0e81\u0eaa\u0eb8\u0ea3\u0eb4\u0e99) and Mi (\u0ea1\u0eb5) were formally recognized, police officers, therefore, set off in pursuit. Even wounded in the arms and legs, Oudom and Mi managed to escape. Supported by local complicity, they succeed in reaching Nong Khai (thai: \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e32\u0e22), on the other side of the Mekong River.\n\nAccording to the police investigations, one of bullets fired by Oudom Louksourine reached Kou Voravong and caused his death. Oudom was a dangerous and notorious gangster, who confessed to have committed about fifteen assassinations. Imprisoned since 1950, he escaped in 1954 and with Mi -his partner in crime- joined a band of bandits established in [[Isan]] region, northeast Thailand, whose leader named Bounkong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e81\u0ead\u0e87), a veteran Lao Issara and faithful follower of Chao Phetsarath.\n\nThis band of gangsters was hostile to France and ploted against the Royal Government. It was partly formed by soldiers who have deserted the Chinaimo camp, located near the capital. The conspiracy's members are gathered and hosted by the Thai police under the order of Colonel Praseuth (thai : \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e10), in Nong Khai, a border city located only 20&nbsp;km from Vientiane. It appeared clearly that the Thai police, with or without the approval of the Government, supported the plot of Chinaimo which projected to reverse the Souvanna Phouma's government in order to return power to Chao Phetsarath, exiled in Bangkok since 1946. In addition, Thai authority appeared to have an ambiguous policy towards this case: they protected the conspirators of the Bounkong's band at the beginning, before eliminated most of them. They have constantly refused to extradite Oudom Louksourine, who would still sentenced to death in absentia for Kou Voravong's assassination by the Court of Vientiane in July 1959. At that time, he was captain in the Thai police.\n\n==== Various theories ====\nIf there was no doubt about the identity of the one who pulled the trigger, various theories about the person who was behind the crime were advanced by some people, depending on their political, ideological or family affiliations. They were mainly three:\n\n#The plot headed by Bounkong, supported by Thai separatists, sympathizers of both Vi\u1ec7t Minh revolutionists and of Chao Phetsarath, was firmly anti-French.

His son Boutsabong, would have informed the conspirators of the reception at Sananikone's, which had been although decided in the afternoon. Bong Souvannavong was then arrested and jailed on October 6. According to some conspirators testimony, this attack would be aimed at [[Phoui Sananikone]], who was accused of the anti-Pathet Lao attitude and not having resisted Western pressures on the [[Geneva Agreements]]. For some of them, Kou Voravong's death would be first of all an error, which was then exploited to threaten pro-French government members,<ref name=\"JD-China\u00efmo78,81,107\">{{cite book |language=fr |author=[[Jean Deuve]] |title=Le complot de China\u00efmo|pages=78, 81, 107}}</ref> and for others, it would be a fatal consequence of his intense anti-subversive activity when he was Minister of the Interior,<ref name=\"LoG-ID\">{{cite web|language=en |url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/20.htm|title=Initial Difficulties|website=U.S.Library of Congress|access-date=27 November 2015 }}</ref> and for still others, that could be an extreme reaction of the French Government to his active anti-feudal militancy for a Laotian led administration. \n#Immediately after the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO)'s signing in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the Thai Army was deployed in the North and on the East Bank of the Mekong River, along the Laotian borders. Following the refusal of the [[the United Nations|UNO]]'s Security Council to monitor borders against communist infiltration,<ref group=\"n\">Request filed late May and rejected on June 18, 1954.</ref> the Bangkok Government fear facing the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] was effective, and the Thai Authorities role in this case appeared decisive. Kou Voravong's refusal to join the military organization blocked any US intervention and thus hindered the \"containment\" policy of which Thailand was part of. During a National Assembly session, Kou Voravong revealed that strong pressures were put on the two Laotian delegation's leaders by the United States so that they refused to sign the agreement's part concerning Laos at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. [[Phoui Sananikone]] would have accepted a one million bribe not to affix his signature. In his speech, Kou Voravong also revealed that the right-wing forces had planned the [[Pathet Lao]]'s troops suppression, as soon as they were withdrawn from [[Houaphan Province|Samneua]] and [[Phongsaly Province]], as set out in the [[Geneva Agreements]]. And lastly, nine days before his murder, he was preparing a meeting between Chao [[Souvanna Phouma]] \u2013 the Lao Royal Government's chief \u2013 and his half-brother Chao [[Souphanouvong]] \u2013 the [[Pathet Lao]]'s leader \u2013 for the discussions in order to organize the free elections envisaged by these same agreements. For some circles, particularly in the Communist left-wing, Kou Voravong would have become a target of the Lao-Thai right-wing and the [[CIA]]: the main \"beneficiaries\" of his death being the Thai and American governments who considered the [[Geneva Agreements]] as a serious concession from France to communist bloc countries.<ref>{{cite book |language=fr |author1=Sav\u00e8ng Phinith|title=Histoire du Pays Lao|pages=149}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|language=fr |author1=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=Laos \u2013 Encore un \"domino\" de tomb\u00e9 |newspaper=L'unit\u00e9 |number=159 |date= 23 May 1975 |pp=20\u201321 |url=http://62.210.214.184/unite/u-result_frame.php?catalogueID=5098&Rubrique=Laos }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |language=en |author=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=The Furtive War |pages=A Fateful Assassination |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/burchett/1963/the-furtive-war/ch09.htm |access-date=20 September 2015 }}</ref>\n#This affair confronted the three most influential rival families in Laos: the Sananikones, the Souvannavongs and the Voravongs. This was typical in Lao political circles where conflicts of families or personalities were mingled with national politics. Kou Voravong \u2013 leading supporter of the policy of \"neutrality\" \u2013 stood in opposition to the American \"anti-communist\" policy which started to find many sympathizers, and among them was [[Phoui Sananikone]]. Actually, Kou Voravong was murdered at the residence of [[Phoui Sananikone]], who shortly after became Minister of the Interior and hastily got Bong Souvannavong- a left-wing sympathizer \u2013 arrested, whom he accused of being the instigator of Chinaimo's conspiracy, and therefore to be behind the assassination. On January 5, 1955, Thai authorities arrested Oudom Louksourine in Bangkok and declared that the latter confessed to having been paid by [[Phoui Sananikone]] to kill Kou Voravong, but however refused to extradite him to Laos. The two rival families newspapers then started a violent campaign against [[Phoui Sananikone]] and the March 9, 1955, complaints for assassination was filed against him by the Voravong family at the Vientiane Court. Despite of the given judgement which concluded to dismiss the case for insufficient evidence, the resentments persisted and the charges were maintained.

A two-thirds majority was necessary for a nomination, but no major political party came to get it. A compromise was reached between the two major parties: half members of former neutralist government \u2013 pro-French, favoring the strict application of the agreements signed at Geneva \u2013 and half members of the progressive opposition \u2013 pro-American, opposed to this same agreements \u2013 knowing that neither side was intending to grant concessions to the other.

On September 9, 1951, an agreement had been signed between Washington and the Royal Government for economic and, to a lesser extent, military support. Only a small number of Protestant missionaries and a project manager, accompanied by a few [[United States Information Agency|USIS]]<ref group=\"n\">USIS was abolished in 1948 as a central organization, but local services abroad retained this title. Its functions were taken over in 1953 by the United States Information Agency (USIA).</ref> and [[CIA]]'s agents were settled in [[Vientiane]], in 1953. But as the independence movement was led by the Communist Party, and [[Vietnam]] was geographically close to China and not far from [[North Korea]], USA got interested in the conflict taking place in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]]. To justify their intervention, the Americans referred to the \"[[Domino theory]]\" that if Vietnam fell into the hands of the Communists, neighboring countries would follow, earned by the contagion or assaulted by military forces from Hanoi. This shift would change radically forces East/West reports in whole Asia.\n\nIn the other camp, the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]]'s victory enabled [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] to control the area of North-Laos, but [[Ho Chi Minh]] nourished a higher ambition for Indochina. Even though the [[Geneva Agreements]] decreed the neutrality of [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], Hanoi considered that the independence of [[Vietnam]] could not be complete as long as its two neighboring countries remained under \"imperialist domination\".<ref group=\"n\">The general [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] wrote in 1950: \u00ab Indochina is one strategic unit and a single battlefield.

This civic association of young Laotians, anti-communist and renovator, was led by the army strongman, the general [[Phoumi Nosavan]]. Born in the Thai-Lao region border (Moukdahane-Savannakhet), he was the nephew of [[Sarit Thanarat]] ([[thai (language)|thai]]: \u0e2a\u0e24\u0e29\u0e14\u0e34\u0e4c \u0e18\u0e19\u0e30\u0e23\u0e31\u0e0a\u0e15\u0e4c) \u2013 the current Thai Government Prime minister \u2013 and first of all, the general [[Phoumi Nosavan]] was Kou Voravong's cousin and brother-in-law.\n\n== The statue ==\n\n=== Creation in Bangkok ===\n\n\n\nDuring the confrontations in 1946, [[Phoumi Nosavan]] had sided with Chao [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetsarath]]'s [[Lao Issara]] Government. And then in the aftermath of the defeat, he took refuge in Thailand. Upon his return from exile in 1949, he joined the newly formed Lao National Army, created in March of the same year.\n\nEarly in 1950, when Bounkong and his band engaged in violent anti-government campaigns in the South of the country, Kou Voravong created the \"Pacification of Southern Laos Mission\" to combat internal subversion and border piracy. This organization whose headquarter was based in [[Pakse]], was responsible to bring together supporters, volunteers and former members of the [[Lao Issara]] movement, to form units to combat subversion and banditry. Occupied with his ministerial responsibilities in Vientiane, he entrusted the command to his cousin and brother-in-law, the young lieutenant [[Phoumi Nosavan]].\n\n[[File:Stade Kou Voravong.jpg|thumb|upright=1|entrance to Kou Voravong stadium]]\n\nConsidering that the Bounkong Band was known in the province, he got in touch with its members and proposed them negotiations so that they convinced the local insurgents to lay down arms and to adhered to the national cause. But the bandits would take advantage of the naivety of the young lieutenant to carry out during several months, acts of banditry, spying and intense anti-government guerrillas, by using the pass, material and funds provided by the chief himself.<ref name=\"JD-HPN77-80\">{{cite book |language=fr |author=[[Jean Deuve]] |title=Histoire de la police nationale du Laos|pages=77\u201380}}</ref> Despite the failure of the \"Pacification of Southern Laos Mission\" which has nearly cost his political career, Kou Voravong renewed his confidence in [[Phoumi Nosavan]] who would pursue his military career until becoming the Lao National Army's chief of staff, in 1955.\n\nFollowing Kou Voravong's death, he led his family members in their search for the truth concerning the assassination. In 1960, during the legislative election campaign of Ou (\u0ead\u0eb8) and Bounthong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e97\u0ebb\u0e87) \u2013 Kou Voravong's half-brothers \u2013 the three cousins promised to the [[Savannakhet]] population that in the event of electoral success they would pay tribute to their brother and cousin, \"the home-grown child\", a murdered rising political figure. Ou and Bounthong Voravong shall be both elected assembly members of the [[Savannakhet Province]] that year.\n\nStarting from 1959 and during six years, with the financial support of [[the CIA]], the general [[Phoumi Nosavan]] became the dominant figure in the Laotian political life. At the height of his career in May 1960, thanks to his relationship with [[Sarit Thanarat]] \u2013 the current Thai Prime Minister \u2013 and in association with Ou and Bounthong Voravong, he commissioned and financed a life-size statue of Kou Voravong at the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] of the Ministry of Culture of Thailand. In [[Savannakhet]], a \"Kou Voravong Stadium\" was built at the extreme north of the avenue of the same name, and the site of the statue was planned on an esplanade just at the entrance.\n\nBut the country was immersed in a civil war, itself within the context of the [[Cold War]]. In 1963, when his uncle the General [[Sarit Thanarat]] died, he lost Thailand's Government support, while on the other side, the United States opted for direct military intervention policy. At the end of January 1965, after several \"disobediences\" to the American military advisory, and following a coup against his government, whose instigator was General [[Kouprasith Abhay]], [[Phoumi Nosavan]] was forced to go into exile in Thailand with his followers and relatives.
