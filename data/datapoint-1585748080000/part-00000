It is the second installment in [[The Godfather (film series)|''The Godfather'' trilogy]]. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', the film is both [[sequel]] and [[prequel]] to ''[[The Godfather]]'', presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of [[Michael Corleone]] (Pacino), the new [[Don (honorific)|Don]] of the [[Corleone family]], protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, [[Vito Corleone]] (De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in [[New York City]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first film, [[Paramount Pictures]] began developing a follow up to the film, with much of the same cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more control on the film, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to the film to tell the story of the rise of Vito and the fall of Michael.\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. ''The Godfather Part II'' premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974, receiving divided reviews from critics but its reputation, however, improved rapidly and it soon became the subject of critical re-evaluation. It grossed between $48\u2013$88 million worldwide on a $13 million budget. The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]] at the [[47th Academy Awards]] and became the first sequel to win for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Its six Oscar wins also included [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Coppola, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for De Niro and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Actor]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\nBoth ''The Godfather Part II'' and its predecessor remain highly influential films, especially in the [[gangster film|gangster]] [[genre]]. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|32nd-greatest film in American film history]] and it retained this position [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10 years later]].<ref name=\"afi\">[http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf \"Citizen Kane Stands the Test of Time\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |date=August 24, 2011 }}.

Vito escapes to New York City and is registered as \"[[Vito Corleone]]\" on [[Ellis Island]].''\n\nIn 1958, during his son's [[First Communion]] party at [[Lake Tahoe]], [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] has a series of meetings in his role as the [[Don (honorific)|don]] of the [[Corleone crime family]]. [[Frank Pentangeli]], a Corleone [[caporegime|capo]], is dismayed that Michael refuses to help defend his territory against the Rosato brothers, who work for Michael's business partner [[Hyman Roth]]. That night, Michael leaves Nevada after surviving an assassination attempt at his home.\n\n: ''In 1917, Vito Corleone lives in New York City with [[Carmela Corleone|his wife]] and son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]. He loses his job due to local don, [[Don Fanucci|Fanucci]], insisting that his nephew work there; [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]] invites Vito to unwittingly take part in a burglary.''\n\nMichael suspects Roth planned the assassination, but meets him in Miami and feigns ignorance. In New York City, Pentangeli attempts to maintain Michael's fa\u00e7ade by making peace with the Rosato family but they attempt to kill him. Roth, Michael, and several of their partners travel to [[Havana]] to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Michael becomes reluctant after reconsidering the viability of the ongoing [[Cuban Revolution]]. On New Year's Eve, he attempts to have Roth and Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola, killed, but Roth survives when Michael's bodyguard is discovered and shot by police. Michael discovers that his brother, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], betrayed him after Fredo inadvertently reveals that he knows Ola after claiming they had never met. Batista abruptly abdicates due to [[Battle of Santa Clara|rebel advances]]. During the ensuing chaos, Michael, Fredo, and Roth separately escape to the United States. Back home, Michael learns that his wife [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]] has miscarried.\n\n: ''By 1920, Vito had fathered two more sons, Fredo and Michael. Vito's criminal conduct attracts the attention of Fanucci, who [[pizzo (extortion)|extorts]] him. His partners, Clemenza and [[Salvatore Tessio]], wish to avoid trouble by paying in full, but Vito insists that he can convince Fanucci to accept a smaller payment by making him \"an offer he won't refuse\". During a neighborhood [[Calendar of saints|festa]], he stalks Fanucci to his apartment and shoots him dead.''\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a [[United States congressional committee|Senate committee]] on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family. Having survived the earlier attempt on his life, Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael, who he believes had double-crossed him, and is placed under witness protection.\n\n: ''Now a respected figure in his community, Vito is approached for help by a widow who is being evicted. After an unsuccessful negotiation with Vito, the widow's landlord asks around, learns of Vito's reputation, and hastily agrees to let the widow stay on terms very favorable to her. Vito and his partners are becoming more and more successful with their business, \"Genco Pura Olive Oil Company\".\n\nOn returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he has felt resentful for being disregarded; he had helped Roth expecting something in return. He claims to be ignorant of the plot on Michael's life. He informs Michael that the Senate lawyer, Questadt, is in Roth's payroll. Michael responds by disowning Fredo and tells his capo that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is alive. Michael is unable to reach the heavily guarded Pentangeli, so he sends for Pentangeli's brother from Sicily, resulting in Pentangeli renouncing his previous statement; the hearing dissolves in an uproar.\n\nKay reveals to Michael that she actually had an abortion, not a miscarriage and that she intends to remove their children from Michael's criminal life. Outraged, Michael strikes Kay, banishes her from the family, and takes custody of the children.\n\n: ''In 1923, Vito, along with his family, visits Sicily for the first time since emigrating. He and business partner Tommasino are admitted to Don Ciccio's compound, ostensibly to ask for Ciccio's blessing on their olive oil business. Vito exacts his childhood vengeance by killing Ciccio after revealing his former identity, but as they escape, Tommasino is shot in the leg and suffers a permanent disability.''\n\nMichael's mother dies. At the funeral, Michael appears to forgive Fredo.\n\nRoth is refused [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and denied [[Law of Return|entry to Israel]]. He is forced to return to the United States. Over the dissent of [[consigliere]] [[Tom Hagen]], capo Rocco Lampone is ordered by Michael to assassinate Roth; posing as a journalist at [[Miami International Airport]], Lampone shoots Roth dead before federal agents kill him. At the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection compound]], Hagen reminds Pentangeli that failed plotters against the Roman Emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for. Pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub. [[Al Neri]], acting on Michael's orders, assassinates Fredo out on the lake.\n\n: ''On December 7, 1941, the Corleone family gathers in their dining room to surprise Vito for his birthday. Michael announces that, in response to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he has left college and enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]], leaving Sonny furious, Tom incredulous, and Fredo the only supportive brother. Vito is heard at the door and all but Michael leave the room to greet him.''\n\nMichael sits alone by the lake at the family compound.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]]\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Vito Corleone]]\n* [[John Cazale]] as [[Fredo Corleone]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Connie Corleone]]\n* [[Lee Strasberg]] as [[Hyman Roth]]\n* [[Michael V.

In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.<ref name=\"DVDcom\">''The Godfather Part II'' DVD commentary featuring Francis Ford Coppola, [2005]</ref>\n\nProduction nearly ended before it began when Pacino's lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\nCoppola discusses his decision to make this the first major U.S. motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title in the [[Audio commentary|director's commentary]] on the [[DVD]] edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the film's success began the common practice of numbered sequels.\n\nOnly three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced ''Part II'' a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michael's parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the film's narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening.<ref>''The Godfather Family: A look Inside''</ref>\n\nIt was the last major American motion picture to have release prints made with [[Technicolor]]'s dye [[imbibition]] process until the late 1990s.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II (soundtrack)}}\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n''The Godfather Part II'' premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974.\n\n=== Home media ===\n\nCoppola created ''[[The Godfather Saga]]'' expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined ''The Godfather'' and ''The Godfather Part II'' with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its [[NBC]] debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the ''Godfather Epic'' boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title ''The Godfather Trilogy 1901\u20131980'', had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set's bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\".\n\n''The Godfather DVD Collection'' was released on October 9, 2001 in a package<ref>\"DVD review: 'The Godfather Collection'\".

The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.<ref name=\"dvd\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection [2001]</ref>\n\nThe restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was \"terrific\".\n\n==== ''The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration'' ====\nAfter a careful restoration of the first two movies, ''The Godfather'' movies were released on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on September 23, 2008, under the title ''The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration''.

directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] from the screenplay co-written with [[Mario Puzo]], starring [[Al Pacino]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Talia Shire]], [[Morgana King]], [[John Cazale]], [[Mariana Hill]], and [[Lee Strasberg]]. It is the second installment in [[The Godfather (film series)|''The Godfather'' trilogy]]. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', the film is both [[sequel]] and [[prequel]] to ''[[The Godfather]]'', presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of [[Michael Corleone]] (Pacino), the new [[Don (honorific)|Don]] of the [[Corleone family]], protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, [[Vito Corleone]] (De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in [[New York City]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first film, [[Paramount Pictures]] began developing a follow up to the film, with much of the same cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more control on the film, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to the film to tell the story of the rise of Vito and the fall of Michael.\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. ''The Godfather Part II'' premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974, receiving divided reviews from critics but its reputation, however, improved rapidly and it soon became the subject of critical re-evaluation. It grossed between $48\u2013$88 million worldwide on a $13 million budget. The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]] at the [[47th Academy Awards]] and became the first sequel to win for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Its six Oscar wins also included [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Coppola, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for De Niro and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Actor]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\nBoth ''The Godfather Part II'' and its predecessor remain highly influential films, especially in the [[gangster film|gangster]] [[genre]]. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|32nd-greatest film in American film history]] and it retained this position [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10 years later]].<ref name=\"afi\">[http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf \"Citizen Kane Stands the Test of Time\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |date=August 24, 2011 }}.

Vito escapes to New York City and is registered as \"[[Vito Corleone]]\" on [[Ellis Island]].''\n\nIn 1958, during his son's [[First Communion]] party at [[Lake Tahoe]], [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] has a series of meetings in his role as the [[Don (honorific)|don]] of the [[Corleone crime family]]. [[Frank Pentangeli]], a Corleone [[caporegime|capo]], is dismayed that Michael refuses to help defend his territory against the Rosato brothers, who work for Michael's business partner [[Hyman Roth]]. That night, Michael leaves Nevada after surviving an assassination attempt at his home.\n\n: ''In 1917, Vito Corleone lives in New York City with [[Carmela Corleone|his wife]] and son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]. He loses his job due to local don, [[Don Fanucci|Fanucci]], insisting that his nephew work there; [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]] invites Vito to unwittingly take part in a burglary.''\n\nMichael suspects Roth planned the assassination, but meets him in Miami and feigns ignorance. In New York City, Pentangeli attempts to maintain Michael's fa\u00e7ade by making peace with the Rosato family but they attempt to kill him. Roth, Michael, and several of their partners travel to [[Havana]] to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Michael becomes reluctant after reconsidering the viability of the ongoing [[Cuban Revolution]]. On New Year's Eve, he attempts to have Roth and Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola, killed, but Roth survives when Michael's bodyguard is discovered and shot by police. Michael discovers that his brother, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], betrayed him after Fredo inadvertently reveals that he knows Ola after claiming they had never met. Batista abruptly abdicates due to [[Battle of Santa Clara|rebel advances]]. During the ensuing chaos, Michael, Fredo, and Roth separately escape to the United States. Back home, Michael learns that his wife [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]] has miscarried.\n\n: ''By 1920, Vito had fathered two more sons, Fredo and Michael. Vito's criminal conduct attracts the attention of Fanucci, who [[pizzo (extortion)|extorts]] him. His partners, Clemenza and [[Salvatore Tessio]], wish to avoid trouble by paying in full, but Vito insists that he can convince Fanucci to accept a smaller payment by making him \"an offer he won't refuse\". During a neighborhood [[Calendar of saints|festa]], he stalks Fanucci to his apartment and shoots him dead.''\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a [[United States congressional committee|Senate committee]] on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family. Having survived the earlier attempt on his life, Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael, who he believes had double-crossed him, and is placed under witness protection.\n\n: ''Now a respected figure in his community, Vito is approached for help by a widow who is being evicted. After an unsuccessful negotiation with Vito, the widow's landlord asks around, learns of Vito's reputation, and hastily agrees to let the widow stay on terms very favorable to her. Vito and his partners are becoming more and more successful with their business, \"Genco Pura Olive Oil Company\".\n\nOn returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he has felt resentful for being disregarded; he had helped Roth expecting something in return. He claims to be ignorant of the plot on Michael's life. He informs Michael that the Senate lawyer, Questadt, is in Roth's payroll. Michael responds by disowning Fredo and tells his capo that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is alive. Michael is unable to reach the heavily guarded Pentangeli, so he sends for Pentangeli's brother from Sicily, resulting in Pentangeli renouncing his previous statement; the hearing dissolves in an uproar.\n\nKay reveals to Michael that she actually had an abortion, not a miscarriage and that she intends to remove their children from Michael's criminal life. Outraged, Michael strikes Kay, banishes her from the family, and takes custody of the children.\n\n: ''In 1923, Vito, along with his family, visits Sicily for the first time since emigrating. He and business partner Tommasino are admitted to Don Ciccio's compound, ostensibly to ask for Ciccio's blessing on their olive oil business. Vito exacts his childhood vengeance by killing Ciccio after revealing his former identity, but as they escape, Tommasino is shot in the leg and suffers a permanent disability.''\n\nMichael's mother dies. At the funeral, Michael appears to forgive Fredo.\n\nRoth is refused [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and denied [[Law of Return|entry to Israel]]. He is forced to return to the United States. Over the dissent of [[consigliere]] [[Tom Hagen]], capo Rocco Lampone is ordered by Michael to assassinate Roth; posing as a journalist at [[Miami International Airport]], Lampone shoots Roth dead before federal agents kill him. At the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection compound]], Hagen reminds Pentangeli that failed plotters against the Roman Emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for. Pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub. [[Al Neri]], acting on Michael's orders, assassinates Fredo out on the lake.\n\n: ''On December 7, 1941, the Corleone family gathers in their dining room to surprise Vito for his birthday. Michael announces that, in response to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he has left college and enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]], leaving Sonny furious, Tom incredulous, and Fredo the only supportive brother. Vito is heard at the door and all but Michael leave the room to greet him.''\n\nMichael sits alone by the lake at the family compound.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]]\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Vito Corleone]]\n* [[John Cazale]] as [[Fredo Corleone]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Connie Corleone]]\n* [[Lee Strasberg]] as [[Hyman Roth]]\n* [[Michael V.

In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.<ref name=\"DVDcom\">''The Godfather Part II'' DVD commentary featuring Francis Ford Coppola, [2005]</ref>\n\nProduction nearly ended before it began when Pacino's lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\nCoppola discusses his decision to make this the first major U.S. motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title in the [[Audio commentary|director's commentary]] on the [[DVD]] edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the film's success began the common practice of numbered sequels.\n\nOnly three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced ''Part II'' a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michael's parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the film's narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening.<ref>''The Godfather Family: A look Inside''</ref>\n\nIt was the last major American motion picture to have release prints made with [[Technicolor]]'s dye [[imbibition]] process until the late 1990s.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II (soundtrack)}}\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n''The Godfather Part II'' premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974.\n\n=== Home media ===\n\nCoppola created ''[[The Godfather Saga]]'' expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined ''The Godfather'' and ''The Godfather Part II'' with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its [[NBC]] debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the ''Godfather Epic'' boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title ''The Godfather Trilogy 1901\u20131980'', had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set's bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\".\n\n''The Godfather DVD Collection'' was released on October 9, 2001 in a package<ref>\"DVD review: 'The Godfather Collection'\".

The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.<ref name=\"dvd\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection [2001]</ref>\n\nThe restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was \"terrific\".\n\n==== ''The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration'' ====\nAfter a careful restoration of the first two movies, ''The Godfather'' movies were released on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on September 23, 2008, under the title ''The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration''. The work was done by [[Robert A. Harris]] of Film Preserve. The Blu-ray Disc box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on Disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).\n\nOther extras are ported over from Paramount's 2001 DVD release.
