The 5,000-watt radio station was put on the air with a transmitter he built from a Heathkit model. He started and applied to the FCC for licensing of the radio station. Mr Hilker owned WCGC and with that built Suburban Radio Group which owned and operated 11 AM and FM radio stations and also put on two television stations; WJZY in Charlotte and another in Morehead City. At the time of Mr. Hilker's death the radio station was still using the transmitter he built as a backup for the now computerized WCGC. Born in Winston-Salem, he served in the U.S. Navy and established Cablevision Companies in Gaston County and the Lake Norman area as well at Charlotte television station WJZY-TV.
