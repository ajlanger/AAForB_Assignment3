It too added a number of new datasets and features, including Ancient Literature cross-references, Cultural Concepts, [[Biblical manuscript|original manuscript]] images, multimedia and the new Factbook that attempted to integrate the increasing number of databases to an even greater extent than was possible in Logos 5. Logos 6 also integrates with the Send to [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\n''Logos Bible Software 7'' was released towards the end of August 2016. Features added with this full version include, Sermon Editor, Course Tool, Figurative Language (interactive), Hebrew Grammatical Constructions, Longacre Genre Analysis, Sentence Types of the New Testament Dataset, Quickstart Layouts, Speech Acts, An Empty Tomb (interactive), Exploring Biblical Manuscripts.\n\n''Logos Bible Software 8'' was released at the end of October 2018.\n\n=== Mobile versions ===\nAn [[iPhone]] [[mobile application|app]] was released alongside Logos 4 in November 2009. It allows users to access most of their Logos resources on the iPhone, with basic search and study features. Resources can be accessed over the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], or downloaded onto the device for offline access. Native [[iPad]] support was added with version 1.4 in April 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thislamp.com/posts/2010/4/18/review-logos-bible-software-for-ipad-v-14.html|title = Review: Logos Bible Software for iPad v. 1.4|date = 18 April 2010|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = This Lamp|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 2.0 (January 2012) added notes, highlights and inline footnotes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/44466.aspx|title = Logos for iOS 2.0.1 Release Notes|date = 27 January 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 3.0 (August 2012) added reading plans and community notes,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/53757.aspx|title = iOS Reader Suite 3.0.0 Release Notes|date = 29 August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and version 4.0 a new [[User interface|UI]] updated for [[iOS 7]]. A topic guide was added in 4.3 (June 2014), and a scrolling view in 4.4 (December 2014). The app is now available in several 'flavours'. In addition to the standard ''Logos Bible Software'' app, other very similar apps exist under the ''Faithlife Study Bible'', ''Vyrso'', ''Verbum'' and ''Noet'' brands. These apps offer similar functionality, different branding, and a slightly different UI. The [[iOS]] app was awarded the [[DBW Publishing Innovation Award]] in 2011.\n\nAn [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app entered a public alpha in May 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/33287.aspx|title = Logos for Android Alpha 4|date = 14 May 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with a beta in July,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bibleandtech.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/logos-for-android-released.html|title = Logos for Android released|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and 1.0 released a year later. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|title = Logos Brings More Parity Between Android and iOS Bible Apps|date = August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Christian Computing Magazine|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201146/http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|archivedate = 23 September 2015}}</ref> and future development has continued along similar lines to the iOS version.\n\n=== Rebranded versions ===\nFaithlife Corporation also produces two rebranded versions of ''Logos Bible Software'' with almost identical functionality''. Verbum'' is aimed at [[Roman Catholics]] (and adds databases of Catholic topics and [[Catholic Saints|Saints]], and more data from the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical Books]]), and ''Noet'' is for those undertaking scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.\n\n== Reception ==\nEach version of Logos Bible Software has generally been received very positively by reviewers and Christian leaders.

In terms of branding, ''Libronix Digital Library System'' refers to the software itself, whilst ''Logos Bible Software Series X'' was used for packages that included both the software and electronic [[Biblical studies]] resources.\n\nVersion 2 of Libronix DLS appeared in July 2003 as ''Logos Bible Software Series X 2.0''. This added support for documents such as notes and word lists, visual filters (which allow users to create rules to add highlighting and markup to resources automatically), and a graphical query editor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.logos.com/products/lbs/lbsx20 |title=Logos Bible Software Series X v2.0 |date=7 July 2003 |accessdate=5 January 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030707145615/http://www.logos.com/products/lbs/lbsx20 |archivedate=July 7, 2003 }}</ref> Version 3 was launched in June 2006 and introduced reverse-interlinear Bibles, the Bible Word Study tool, and syntax searches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.logos.com/logos3 |title=Introducing...

In March 2008 an [[alpha version]] of Logos Bible Software for [[Macintosh|Mac]] was released for testing,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.supakoo.com/rick/ricoblog/2008/03/14/MacintoshLogosBibleSoftwareHitsAlpha.aspx|title = Macintosh Logos Bible Software Hits Alpha|date = 14 March 2008|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with the retail edition shipping in December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.logos.com/archives/2008/12/the_answer_to_your_question_is_now.html |title=The Answer to Your Question Is \"Now\"! |date=5 December 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401060609/http://blog.logos.com/archives/2008/12/the_answer_to_your_question_is_now.html |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> This was known as ''Logos Bible Software for Mac 1.0'', and although based on the Windows version, full parity was never achieved, even with versions 1.1 and 1.2 which shipped in 2009.\n\nHowever, on November 2, 2009, Logos announced ''Logos Bible Software 4'' for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], along with an early alpha version of Mac edition and a cut-down [[iPhone]] version. Like the original release of the Libronix Digital Library System, the application had been substantially rewritten, and featured a very different [[graphical user interface]] than its predecessor.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bsreview.org/blog/?p=1816|title = Logos Bible Software 4.0 Launched!|date = 2 November 2009|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Bible Software Review Weblog|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Crucially, once the Mac version was completed, both editions of the software would be almost identical in function, and settings, documents and resources would seamlessly sync between the different versions.

Logos 5.1 (July 2013) added read-along audio and a new topic layout,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://blog.logos.com/2013/07/introducing-logos-5-1/|title = Introducing Logos 5.1|date = 2 July 2013|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with several more minor improvements in 5.2 (November 2013).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://wiki.logos.com/Logos_5.2|title = Logos 5.2|date = |accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n''Logos Bible Software 6'' was released at the end of October 2014,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.reformation21.org/blog/2014/10/logos-6-arrives.php|title = Logos 6 arrives|date = 27 October 2014|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Reformation21|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and became the first version to support [[64-bit architecture]]. It too added a number of new datasets and features, including Ancient Literature cross-references, Cultural Concepts, [[Biblical manuscript|original manuscript]] images, multimedia and the new Factbook that attempted to integrate the increasing number of databases to an even greater extent than was possible in Logos 5. Logos 6 also integrates with the Send to [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\n''Logos Bible Software 7'' was released towards the end of August 2016. Features added with this full version include, Sermon Editor, Course Tool, Figurative Language (interactive), Hebrew Grammatical Constructions, Longacre Genre Analysis, Sentence Types of the New Testament Dataset, Quickstart Layouts, Speech Acts, An Empty Tomb (interactive), Exploring Biblical Manuscripts.\n\n''Logos Bible Software 8'' was released at the end of October 2018.\n\n=== Mobile versions ===\nAn [[iPhone]] [[mobile application|app]] was released alongside Logos 4 in November 2009. It allows users to access most of their Logos resources on the iPhone, with basic search and study features. Resources can be accessed over the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], or downloaded onto the device for offline access. Native [[iPad]] support was added with version 1.4 in April 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thislamp.com/posts/2010/4/18/review-logos-bible-software-for-ipad-v-14.html|title = Review: Logos Bible Software for iPad v. 1.4|date = 18 April 2010|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = This Lamp|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 2.0 (January 2012) added notes, highlights and inline footnotes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/44466.aspx|title = Logos for iOS 2.0.1 Release Notes|date = 27 January 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 3.0 (August 2012) added reading plans and community notes,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/53757.aspx|title = iOS Reader Suite 3.0.0 Release Notes|date = 29 August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and version 4.0 a new [[User interface|UI]] updated for [[iOS 7]]. A topic guide was added in 4.3 (June 2014), and a scrolling view in 4.4 (December 2014). The app is now available in several 'flavours'. In addition to the standard ''Logos Bible Software'' app, other very similar apps exist under the ''Faithlife Study Bible'', ''Vyrso'', ''Verbum'' and ''Noet'' brands. These apps offer similar functionality, different branding, and a slightly different UI. The [[iOS]] app was awarded the [[DBW Publishing Innovation Award]] in 2011.\n\nAn [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app entered a public alpha in May 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/33287.aspx|title = Logos for Android Alpha 4|date = 14 May 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with a beta in July,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bibleandtech.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/logos-for-android-released.html|title = Logos for Android released|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and 1.0 released a year later. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|title = Logos Brings More Parity Between Android and iOS Bible Apps|date = August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Christian Computing Magazine|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201146/http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|archivedate = 23 September 2015}}</ref> and future development has continued along similar lines to the iOS version.\n\n=== Rebranded versions ===\nFaithlife Corporation also produces two rebranded versions of ''Logos Bible Software'' with almost identical functionality''. Verbum'' is aimed at [[Roman Catholics]] (and adds databases of Catholic topics and [[Catholic Saints|Saints]], and more data from the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical Books]]), and ''Noet'' is for those undertaking scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.\n\n== Reception ==\nEach version of Logos Bible Software has generally been received very positively by reviewers and Christian leaders. It is frequently praised for being user-friendly,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software 5|last = Barrett|first = Charles M.|date = April 2013|journal = Themelios|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> having the largest number of available resources of any comparable software,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software 3|last = Challies|first = Tim|date = Fall 2006|journal = The Journal of Modern Ministry|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref name=\"themelios39\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software 5 Platinum|last = Tabb|first = Brian J.|date = April 2014|journal = Themelios|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> and offering unique tools and datasets not found in any comparable products.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software Series X|last = Parker|first = David|date = July 2003|journal = Evangelical Review of Theology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> However, it has also received some criticisms for its high cost<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Baker Academic Biblical Studies Bundle|last = Naselli|first = Andrew David|date = April 2014|journal = Themelios|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> and lack of speed when compared with other Bible software packages.<ref name=\"themelios39\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\nLogos Bible Software official websites:\n* [https://www.logos.com/ Logos]\n* [https://verbum.com/ Verbum]\n* [https://noet.com/ Noet]\n\n[[Category:Electronic Bibles]]\n[[Category:Electronic publishing]]\n[[Category:Digital library software]]\n", "name_user": "Kevinalewis", "label": "safe", "comment": "8.13 Beta 2 (8.13.0.0003)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_Bible_Software"}
