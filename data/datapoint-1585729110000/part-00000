Its natural [[habitat]]s are temperate [[forest]]s and Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe brown-headed honeyeater was first described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors|Vigors]] & [[Thomas Horsfield|Horsfield]] in 1827. Its species name is derived from the [[Latin]] terms ''brevis'' 'short', and ''rostrum'' 'beak'. Five subspecies have been described.
