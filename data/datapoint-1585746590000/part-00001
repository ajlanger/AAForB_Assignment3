One track (14) was  permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as [[SMPTE]] or [[MIDI timecode|MTC]]. Each channel strip included [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto [[Punch in / out|punch in and out]], among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1\" tape.

During the late 1960s, Akai adopted [[Tandberg]]'s [[cross-field head|cross-field recording]] technologies (using an extra tape head) to enhance high frequency recording and switched to the increasingly reliable Glass and crystal (X'tal) (GX) ferrite heads a few years later{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The company's most popular products{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} were the GX-630D, GX-635D, GX-747/GX-747DBX and GX-77 open-reel recorders (latter featuring an auto-loading function), the three-head, closed-loop GX-F95, GX-90, GX-F91, GX-R99 cassette decks, and the AM-U61, AM-U7 and AM-93 stereo amplifiers.\n\nAkai manufactured and badged most of its imported hi-fi products with the [[Tensai International|Tensai]] brand (named after the Swiss audio and electronics distributor '''Tensai International'''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

One track (14) was  permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as [[SMPTE]] or [[MIDI timecode|MTC]]. Each channel strip included [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto [[Punch in / out|punch in and out]], among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1\" tape. The MG-1212 was later replaced by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.\n\n====AX series analog synthesizers====\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;margin:-1.65ex 0 -1.65ex auto;\">\n[[Image:AKAI AX80.jpg|thumb|220px|AX80]]</div>\n<!-- div style=\"clear:right;float:right;margin:-1.65ex 0 -1.65ex auto;\">\n[[Image:AKAI AX60.jpg|thumb|220px|AX60]]</div -->\n{{main|Akai AX80|Akai AX60}}\n\nOther early products included the Akai [[AX80]] 8-voice analog synthesizer in 1984,<ref name=akaipromi-prod/> followed by [[Akai AX60|AX60]] and AX73 6-voice analog synthesizers ca.1986.<ref name=vse-ax60>\n{{cite web\n | title\t= Akai AX60\n | url  \t= http://www.vintagesynth.com/akai/ax60.php\n | publisher\t= vintage synth explorer\n}}</ref><ref name=vse-ax73>\n{{cite web\n | title\t= Akai AX73\n | url  \t= http://www.vintagesynth.com/akai/ax73.php\n | publisher\t= vintage synth explorer\n}}</ref> The AX-60 borrowed many ideas from the [[Roland Juno-106|Roland Juno series]], but used voltage controlled analog oscillators (VCO) as a sound source as opposed to Roland's more common digitally controlled analog oscillators (DCO), and also allowed the performer to \"split\" the keyboard (using different timbres for different ranges of keys).
