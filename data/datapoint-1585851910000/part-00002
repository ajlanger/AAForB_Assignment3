(Aquaeductus vestibuli labeled at bottom right]]\n\nThe vestibular aqueduct acts as a canal between the inner ear and the cranial cavity. Running through it is a tube called the [[endolymphatic duct]], which normally carries a fluid called [[endolymph]] from the inner ear to the endolymphatic sac in the cranial cavity.  When the endolymphatic duct and sac are larger than normal, as is the case in large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, endolymph is allowed to travel back from the [[endolymphatic sac]] into the inner ear.  This often results fluctuations in hearing levels.  Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are caused by mutations in gene SLC26A4, which is also associated with Pendred's syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts often occur with other inner ear development problems, such as [[cochlea]]r deformities. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are part of the classic  Mondini deformity. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs occur in [[Pendred syndrome]] which is caused by a defect on chromosome 7q31.<ref name=PdsMutation />. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts can also occur in Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, CHARGE syndrome and [[renal tubular acidosis]].\n\nEnlarged vestibular aqueducts can be bilateral or unilateral.\n\nHearing loss caused by large vestibular aqueduct syndrome is not inevitable, although people with the syndrome are at a much higher risk of developing hearing loss than the general population.   Hearing loss is very likely.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nEnlarged vestibular aqueducts are commonly picked up after newborn hearing screen when a child is identified as having a hearing loss. The hearing loss is commonly mixed and can be of any degree when first identified. The conductive component is due to a third window effect caused by the widened vestibular aqueduct. \nDuring an audiologic assessment, an air-bone gap in the low frequencies can occur due to the enlarged vestibular aqueduct acting as a third mobile window. Hearing loss in the contralateral ear to the enlarged vestibular aqueduct can also occur due to the chemical composition on both sides. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greinwald |first1=J |title=Significance of unilateral enlarged vestibular aqueduct |journal=The Laryngoscope |date=2013 |volume=123 |issue=6 |page=1537-1546 |doi=10.1002}}</ref> \nTorticollis has also been found to be an indicator of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct in children. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brodsky |first1=J |title=Torticollis in children with enlarged vestibular aqueducts |journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinalaryngology |date=2020 |volume=131 |doi=10.1016}}</ref>\nIdentification of the enlarged vestibular aqueduct in a child is usually by MRI scan which identifies the fluid within the endolymphatic duct and sac. CT scan may be needed to see the vestibular aqueduct clearly. In adults CT scan may be the first investigation.\nIn order to diagnose the cause of the enlarged vestibular aqueduct the physician will need a detailed family history, full examination to include vestibular examination and, if a bilateral finding, molecular genetic testing as appropriate. With unilateral enlarged vestibular aqueducts molecular genetic testing is currently not recommended.\n\n==Management==\n\nThere is no treatment to correct an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Any hearing loss will need management with amplification and support in education and at work. If the hearing loss becomes severe to profound, cochlear implants can be of significant value. Vestibular disturbance is usually short-lived and associated with head trauma but significant vestibular hypofunction may require rehabilitation. \n\nPeople with enlarged vestibular aqueducts are advised to avoid head trauma where possible. This usually means avoiding contact sports such as football, boxing, rugby, horse riding, trampolining and other sports where head injury may occur.
