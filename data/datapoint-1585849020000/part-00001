As the ice melted, [[Lake Stowe]] was formed. When the ice melted completely, the water from the lake ran out through the [[Lamoille River]] valley.\n\nThis area was long occupied by the Algonquian-speaking indigenous [[Abenaki]] people and their ancestors. During French colonization of what is now Canada, fur traders began to trade with the Abenaki. There were also French who settled here, coming down from the settlements in Quebec, and named the Lamoille River. The French later enlisted the Abenaki as allies in the frontier raiding and wars with English colonists in the lower New England colonies. For decades there was no border and peoples passed freely through this area.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and Vermont's admission as a separate state, the county was settled in the 19th century by American migrants from other parts of New England and French-Canadian immigrants from across the border. Some developed small farms. Some came to work in the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain, which operated into the 20th century. Some gradually moved to other counties where there were cotton mills, weaving cotton from the South both before and after the Civil War. In the United States, many of the French immigrants were forced to accept anglicization of their names, such as New City for Villeneuve, or Senton for St. Onge. Some of their descendants have reclaimed their family's original names.\n\n==20th century to present==\nMining continued through the 20th century. By the late 20th century, environmental hazards were better understood, but many of the miners contracted [[asbestosis]] and other diseases of the lungs from their work.\n\nIn 1972, the Lamoille Community College was the fifth of the several community colleges that became part of the Vermont State Colleges system. At the time, they were renamed as Community College of Vermont.\n\nIn 2008, the state notified residents of Belvidere, Eden, Hyde Park, Johnson, Waterville and eight towns in the adjacent counties of Orleans and Franklin, that a review of health records from 1995 to 2006 had revealed that residents within {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} of the former asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain had higher than normal rates of contracting [[asbestosis]]. The state and federal government continued to study this problem.<ref>{{cite book| author = Rathke, Lisa |title = Neighbors worry about mine's impact on health | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = December 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009 the Vermont Department of health released a revised study which found that all of deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by individual occupational exposure. The report concluded that people living near the mines had no more increased risk of asbestos-related illness than people living anywhere else in Vermont.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthvermont.gov/health-environment/asbestos-lead-buildings/asbestos|title=Overview: Asbestos in Buildings|date=2016-07-18|work=Vermont Department of Health|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the county appeared to have disproportionate power in the legislature with the House Speaker, [[Shap Smith]], from Morrisville, [[Floyd Nease (politician)|Floyd Nease]], house majority leader, Senator [[Susan Bartlett]], from Hyde Park, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Richard Westman, chair of the House Transportation Committee and the sole Republican.<ref>{{cite book | author = Remsen, Nancy |title = Quartet hold power positions in 2009 Legislature | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = January 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|464|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|459|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_50.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> It is the second-smallest county in Vermont by area, as well as one of only two Vermont counties that does not share a border with another state or with Quebec.\n\nLamoille County is the only county in Vermont that does not have at least one of Vermont's five U.S. Routes passing through it, although all ten of the Lamoille County towns are served by Vermont state routes.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans County]] \u2014 northeast\n* [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] \u2014 east\n* [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]] \u2014 south\n* [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]] \u2014 west\n* [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]] \u2014 northwest\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 10475\n|1850= 10872\n|1860= 12311\n|1870= 12448\n|1880= 12684\n|1890= 12831\n|1900= 12289\n|1910= 12585\n|1920= 11858\n|1930= 10947\n|1940= 11028\n|1950= 11388\n|1960= 11027\n|1970= 13309\n|1980= 16767\n|1990= 19735\n|2000= 23233\n|2010= 24475\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=25300\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/vt190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|editor-last=Forstall|editor-first=Richard L.|date=March 27, 1995|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

As the ice melted, [[Lake Stowe]] was formed. When the ice melted completely, the water from the lake ran out through the [[Lamoille River]] valley.\n\nThis area was long occupied by the Algonquian-speaking indigenous [[Abenaki]] people and their ancestors. During French colonization of what is now Canada, fur traders began to trade with the Abenaki. There were also French who settled here, coming down from the settlements in Quebec, and named the Lamoille River. The French later enlisted the Abenaki as allies in the frontier raiding and wars with English colonists in the lower New England colonies. For decades there was no border and peoples passed freely through this area.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and Vermont's admission as a separate state, the county was settled in the 19th century by American migrants from other parts of New England and French-Canadian immigrants from across the border. Some developed small farms. Some came to work in the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain, which operated into the 20th century. Some gradually moved to other counties where there were cotton mills, weaving cotton from the South both before and after the Civil War. In the United States, many of the French immigrants were forced to accept anglicization of their names, such as New City for Villeneuve, or Senton for St. Onge. Some of their descendants have reclaimed their family's original names.\n\n==20th century to present==\nMining continued through the 20th century. By the late 20th century, environmental hazards were better understood, but many of the miners contracted [[asbestosis]] and other diseases of the lungs from their work.\n\nIn 1972, the Lamoille Community College was the fifth of the several community colleges that became part of the Vermont State Colleges system. At the time, they were renamed as Community College of Vermont.\n\nIn 2008, the state notified residents of Belvidere, Eden, Hyde Park, Johnson, Waterville and eight towns in the adjacent counties of Orleans and Franklin, that a review of health records from 1995 to 2006 had revealed that residents within {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} of the former asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain had higher than normal rates of contracting [[asbestosis]]. The state and federal government continued to study this problem.<ref>{{cite book| author = Rathke, Lisa |title = Neighbors worry about mine's impact on health | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = December 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009 the Vermont Department of health released a revised study which found that all of deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by individual occupational exposure. The report concluded that people living near the mines had no more increased risk of asbestos-related illness than people living anywhere else in Vermont.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthvermont.gov/health-environment/asbestos-lead-buildings/asbestos|title=Overview: Asbestos in Buildings|date=2016-07-18|work=Vermont Department of Health|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the county appeared to have disproportionate power in the legislature with the House Speaker, [[Shap Smith]], from Morrisville, [[Floyd Nease (politician)|Floyd Nease]], house majority leader, Senator [[Susan Bartlett]], from Hyde Park, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Richard Westman, chair of the House Transportation Committee and the sole Republican.<ref>{{cite book | author = Remsen, Nancy |title = Quartet hold power positions in 2009 Legislature | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = January 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|464|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|459|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_50.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> It is the second-smallest county in Vermont by area, as well as one of only two Vermont counties that does not share a border with another state or with Quebec.\n\nLamoille County is the only county in Vermont that does not have at least one of Vermont's five U.S. Routes passing through it, although all ten of the Lamoille County towns are served by Vermont state routes.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans County]] \u2014 northeast\n* [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] \u2014 east\n* [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]] \u2014 south\n* [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]] \u2014 west\n* [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]] \u2014 northwest\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 10475\n|1850= 10872\n|1860= 12311\n|1870= 12448\n|1880= 12684\n|1890= 12831\n|1900= 12289\n|1910= 12585\n|1920= 11858\n|1930= 10947\n|1940= 11028\n|1950= 11388\n|1960= 11027\n|1970= 13309\n|1980= 16767\n|1990= 19735\n|2000= 23233\n|2010= 24475\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=25300\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/vt190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|editor-last=Forstall|editor-first=Richard L.|date=March 27, 1995|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.
