It was marketed in the [[United Kingdom]] as the '''Vauxhall Royale Coup\u00e9''' by [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]].<ref>[http://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/reviews/vauxhall/royale/ Vauxhall Royale and Royale Coupe (1978 - 1984)], Honest John, 22 August 2013</ref>\n\n== Monza A1 (1978\u20131982) ==\n\nThe Monza was planned as a successor for the [[Opel Commodore|Commodore Coup\u00e9]]. In the late 70's the Commodore C model was made as a 2-door version (as was the Rekord E1), but still as a sedan type car. The first model of the Commodore the \"A\" series had a regular coup\u00e9 in the production line and Opel desired to make a newer version of their large luxury coup\u00e9. Work began in 1976 and in 1978 the first Monzas were available to buy. The cars to compete with would be the Mercedes W126 coup\u00e9 and the [[BMW]] 6 series C models (coupe models), and any other large luxury coupe. But what Opel hadn't realized was that the old ways were too old. The car was big without being hugely luxurious. This did not mean that the Monza was not comfortable. There was plenty of space inside the car, and the enormous seats left you with a feeling of sitting in a much more upmarket brand than Opel.\n[[File:1979 Opel Monza Automatic 3.0 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Opel Monza coupe rear (1978\u20131982)]]\n[[File:Vauxhall Royale coupe aka Monza A for UK market 2784cc registered April 1979.JPG|thumb|right|Vauxhall Royale coupe]]\n\nThe internals consisted of parts mainly borrowed from the Rekord E1 and later the E2, which meant cloth seats, and lots and lots of plastic on the dashboard and inner doors. Even the rev counter and the tachometer was taken directly from the Rekord E models, so that when you sat in one, the feeling was not that you drove a Monza, but more that you where driving a Rekord. If that wasn't enough trouble for Opel, they also experienced gearbox problems. The engine range for the Monza A1 was the 3.0S, the 2.8S, the newly developed 3.0E and later the 2.5E (the 3.0 had 180&nbsp;bhp and 248 Nm with fuel injection), gave a wide range. The 3-speed Borg Warner automatic transmission from the Commodore range needed to be modified to cope with the new and improved power outputs. Opel's own 4-speed manual gearboxes were not up to the job and, instead of putting in a more modern 5-speed manual gearbox, Opel turned to gearbox and transmission producer [[Getrag]], and installed the Getrag 264 4-speed manual gearbox in the early Monzas. But when people bought a big, luxurious coup\u00e9 they wanted modern products as well, and Opel obliged, as soon the Getrag 240 (for the 2.5  engines) and the Getrag 265 (for the 3.0E), both 5-speed manual gearboxes, replaced the old 4-speed gearbox.\n\nThe Monza, however, sharing the same layout as the Senator A1, had very good driving abilities. It handled quite well, thanks to the newly developed [[MacPherson strut]] system for the front of the car, as used on the Rekord E1 and E2, and the new (previously Opel had always used a non-independent rear axle on the Rekord E1 and E2, Manta, Ascona etc.) independent rear suspension gave the car soft, yet firm and capable, driving characteristics and excellent stability for such a big car. The engine range, however non-economical, was also very good, and few problems with the extremely reliable engines, even today, some 30 years later. The 6-cylinder engines were all of the CIH type (camshaft in head) and were in reality a 2.0-litre straight 4 with just 2 more cylinders. Many parts on the engine, such as the water pump and drive train, are in fact the same parts as used on the 4-cylinder version. This meant that this was an engine not only tested for many years in the Commodore, Admiral and Diplomat range, but also very reliable. Although the first generation of 3.0E engines in the Monza A1 had overheating problems when standing still, this could easily be fixed by fitting an oil-cooler.\n\nWhen Opel realized that the public disliked the Rekord interior, they introduced the \"C\" package. The \"C\" cars were fitted with extra instruments (oil pressure, voltmeter etc.) and the interior was either red, dark blue, green, or brown. As all parts of the interior were coloured, it seemed more luxurious than it did previously.\n\nThe A1 also came with a sports package or \"S\" package. The cars all where marked as \"S\" models on the front wings, and came with 15-inch Ronal alloy wheels and a 45% limited slip differential.\n\nHowever, being a coupe, it was rather large, and four well-sized adults had plenty of space. Even the boot was extremely large, and if that was not enough people had the possibility to flip down the rear seats to make even more space. The A1 was not a great hit at the customers even though it was fairly cheap to buy, the class of the car taken in consideration, and the fact that it actually got some good reviews by the press.\n\nWith the 3.0-litre engine, the Monza was at that time the fastest car Opel had ever built. Being capable of speeds as high as 215&nbsp;km/h, and the 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h mark went in just 8.5 seconds.\n\n== Monza A2 (1982\u20131986) ==\n[[File:OPEL-VAUX-MONZA-A-FACELIFT.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza (1982\u20131986)]]\n[[File:Opel monza h sst.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza rear (1982\u20131986)]]\nIn 1982, the Monza, [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] and [[Opel Senator|Senator]] all got a face-lift and were named the A2 (E2 for the Rekord). The A2 looked similar to the A1 overall but with some small changes to the front end. The headlights noticeably increased in size, and the front was more streamlined than the A1. The car was much more slippery, with drag resistance down by around ten percent (from 0.40 to 0.35 <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm x\\,</math>).<ref name=\"Mon813\">{{cite journal | ref= ED1 | journal=Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 107 | title= Essai detaill\u00e9: Opel Senator 2.2i| trans-title = Detailed Test | last= Pirotte | first= Marcel | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume=36 | number=813 | date=1985-01-24 | publisher=Editions Auto-Magazine }}</ref> Also the chrome parts like bumpers etc. were changed to a matt black finish, or with plastic parts. The bumpers were now made of plastic and gave the Monza the look of a sports car in appearance, and actually did look similar to the Opel Manta, despite the ample size difference. The rear lights were the same and the orange front indicators were now clear glass, giving a much more modern look to the car. Overall the update was regarded as successful although retrospectively some of the purity of the lines of the early car were lost.\n\nAt a time of rising fuel prices, the need for fuel efficiency was becoming paramount, and Opel decided to change the engine specifications of the Monza. This meant introducing both the inline four-cylinder CIH 2.0E engine from the Rekord E2 (replaced by the torquier 2.2 in October 1984).<ref name=\"Mon813\"/> However, as the Monza weighs almost 1400&nbsp;kg, given the 115&nbsp;PS of the two engines, the cars were underpowered and thus unpopular. The 2.5E was given a new Bosch injection system so between 136 and 140&nbsp;PS was available. The 2.8S was taken out of production. The 3.0E engine stayed the top of the range. The 3.0E was given an upgraded Bosch fuel injection and fuel consumption improved somewhat.\n\nThe cars now came with more luxurious interior, electrically controlled side mirrors and even an on-board computer, recording fuel consumption, speed and range.\n\n=== Monza GSE ===\n\n[[File:Opel Monza GSE vl white TCE.jpg|thumb|left|Opel Monza ''GSE'' (1983\u20131986)]]\n[[File:Keinath C5.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza convertible:<br>Keinath C5]]\nThe last incarnation of the Monza was the GSE edition in mid-1983;<ref name=\"Mon813\"/> basically the A2 car, but a high-specification model which had [[Recaro]] sports seats, digital [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] instruments, firmer suspension, the Getrag five-speed manual transmission, and an enhanced all-black interior. It also featured a large rear spoiler on the boot. Also GSE models are equipped with a 40% limited slip differential, an addition that had to be ordered separately on earlier 3.0E cars when purchasing.\n\nBy the time the Senator was updated to the new Senator B and the Monza cancelled, 43,812 Monzas had been built. There was no direct Monza replacement, although the idea of a large [[Opel]]/[[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] sporting car was carried on in the [[Lotus Carlton]]/Lotus Omega saloon. Bitter Cars put a 4.0 engine under the hood as a prototype. Three were built; two left hand drive and one right hand drive, one left hand drive burned out on a motorway in Germany and the other is in a museum, but the right hand drive one is in [[Somerset]], UK.\n\n==Holden Monza==\nIn [[Australia]], local racing legend [[Peter Brock]] had plans to import, modify and market the Opel Monza Coup\u00e9 as the Holden Monza with the [[Holden V8 engine|Holden 5 Litre]] [[V8 engine|V8]] fitted, through his own '''HDT''' ([[Holden Dealer Team]]) business, but the plans eventually fell through.<ref>[http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/news/1506/monaro-or-monza-holden-faces-a-coupe-conundrum/ Monaro or Monza?
