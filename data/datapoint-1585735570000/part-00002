(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2005. After the series took a year off the air, [[Angela Groothuizen]] returned to host her final season. The season took place in Australia, returning to the first country the series visited, and the island of Bali in Indonesia. The season premiered on January 14, 2005. The Reunion aired on March 18, 2005 where [[Marc-Marie Huijbregts]] was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac23,000.-. Huijbregts, alongside his runner-up {{ill|Lottie Hellingman|nl}}, had successfully unmasked [[Yvon Jaspers]] as the Mole of 2005.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], this was the first season which had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Australia]] and [[Bali|Bali, Indonesia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTwo twists were implemented throughout the season, where at every Execution Ceremony, Angela would reveal the percent of questions that candidates got correct about the Mole. After from the second test onwards, if the candidates had a smaller percentage of correct answers than the previous test, two candidates would be executed from the game instead of one. The Double Execution would only happen once throughout the season, if the candidates had failed to keep their percent up.\n\nSecondly, Candidates were approached over the phone via a messager from the Mole throughout the season. At every opportunity, if the Candidates accepted the Mole's offer to sabotage assignments, they would automatically earn 5 correct answers on their next test, regardless of how they performed in the tests.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Yvon Jaspers]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 16\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{nowrap|[[Marc-Marie Huijbregts]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 16\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Lottie Hellingman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 16\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Isabelle Brinkman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Sander de Heer|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 12\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Gijs Staverman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 10\n|rowspan=2|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jim de Groot|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 10\n|-\n|[[Victoria Koblenko]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 8\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Yvonne van den Hurk|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 6\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Roeland Fernhout|fr}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|Withdrew\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!
