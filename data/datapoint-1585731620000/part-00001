After the B\u00e1thory family built a mansion in the town in 1592, the castle became deserted and today lies in ruins.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Catholic Church]] was built in 1534 by Transylvania's voivode [[B\u00e1thory Istv\u00e1n]] and his wife Telegdy Katalin with the occasion of their son's birth. [[Holy Trinity Statue, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Holy Trinity Statue]] was built in 1772. [[Reformed Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Reformed Church]] was rebuilt between 1729 and 1736. The [[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum|synagogue]] was built in 1876.\n\nThe [[\u015eimleu Silvaniei Fort|mansion]] was occupied by [[Giorgio Basta]] from [[Zsigmond B\u00e1thory]] in 1600. It was occupied by the [[Ottomans]] in 1660 and was part of [[Varat Eyalet]] until 1692. In 1703 it was occupied by [[Kurucs]].\n\nFrom 1876 to 1920, \u0218imleu Silvaniei was part of the [[Szil\u00e1gy County]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nThe [[Greek Catholic]] Vicariate of \u0218imleu Silvaniei was formed in 1910 and in 1817 the vicariate opened its own school. George Tatu (1810-1824), Georgiu Abraham (1824-1828), Isidor Alpini (1828-1835), [[Alexandru Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu]] (1836-1850), Demetriu Coroianu (1850-1873), [[Alimpiu Barboloviciu]] (1873-1914), Alexandru Ghetie (1914-1922), Emil Bran (1926-1932), Petru Cupcea (1932-1940), Cornel Darabant (1940-1945), Gheorghe \u021aurca\u0219 (2004-2009) served as vicars of \u0218imleu Silvaniei. The old Greek Catholic church was destroyed by a storm in 1866. [[Notre Dame Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Notre Dame Church]] was built between 1871 and 1873.<ref>[http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&idart=355 Scurt istoric al Vicariatului Silvaniei]</ref>\n\nIn 1919, [[Simion B\u0103rnutiu Na\u021bional College]], the first [[Romanian language]] high school in [[S\u0103laj County]] was founded here, and today the town is home to three high schools.\n\nIn 1940, \u0218imleu Silvaniei, along with the rest of [[Northern Transylvania]], was given to Hungary through the [[Second Vienna Award]] imposed by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]]; Romania regained the area in 1944.\n\nSince 1997, inside [[Bic Monastery]], there is the wooden church from [[St\u00e2na, S\u0103laj|St\u00e2na]]; built in 1778 it has a rectangular plan with nave and pronave.<ref>[http://www.welcometoromania.ro/DN1h/DN1h_Simleu_Silvaniei_e.htm \u0218imleu Silvaniei]</ref>\n\n==Holocaust==\n{{Main|Cehei ghetto}}\nThe Cehei ghetto operated within the town's administrative area. The ghetto was one of the Nazi-era ghettos for European Jews during World War II. It was active in the spring of 1944, following [[Operation Margarethe]]. The deportations from Cehei took place in three transports: May 31 (3,106), June 3 (3,161) and June 6 (1,584), with a total of 7,851 Jews sent to [[Auschwitz]]. Some 1,200 S\u0103laj Jews survived the Holocaust but later emigrated from Romania, so that by the 2000s, under fifty Jews remained in the county.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1910 |6885\n|1930 |7448\n|1948 |7931\n|1956 |8560\n|1966 |12324\n|1977 |14575\n|1992 |17642\n|2002 |17053\n|2011 |13200\n}}\n\nAccording to the last [[Demographics of Romania|census from 2011]] there were 13,200  people living within the city.\n\nOf this population, 66.77% are ethnic [[Romanians]], while 22.87% are ethnic [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], 9.82 ethnic [[Romani people|Romani]] and 0.51% others.<ref>[http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=2140&judet_id=2508&localitate_id=2512 2002 Census]</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n=== 2012 election ===\nThe \u0218imleu Silvaniei Council, elected in the [[2012 Romanian local election|2012 local government election]], is made up of 17 councilors, with the following party composition: 7-[[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]], 4-[[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], 3-[[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]], 2-[[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], and 1-[[People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu]].<ref>[http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/index.php?cmd=article&artid=33623 Alegerile locale in S\u0103laj, rezultate finale!]</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!
