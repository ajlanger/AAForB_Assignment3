The city is famous for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products.\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827\u20131828.\n\n[[File:Capt john.jpg|thumb|Capt John War memorial maintained by army at Dehradun]]\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited.

In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital.\n\n===Afghan Connection===\nDehradun's Afghan connection dated back to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], after which the Afghan Emir [[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)]] was exiled by the British to Dehra Dun.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/Tracing-Doons-Afghan-connect/articleshow/47835111.cms|title=Tracing Doon's Afghan connect - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years.

The present Mangla Devi Inter College, was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life. The extended family and servants of the King were also relocated to Dehradun<ref>''Malalai Joan of Arc of Afghanistan and the Victors of Maiwand: The Second Anglo-Afghan War 1878-1882''https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZsuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&dq=afghanistan+dehradun&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAnsnu0ufZAhWP2VMKHZDeCFgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=afghanistan%20dehradun&f=false</ref>\n\nThe Afghan royal family maintained a presence in Dehra Dun. It was the birthplace of the second to last [[King of Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]]. Two quaint palaces \u2014 the Kabul Place in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie \u2014 stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan. The Balahissar Palace has now been turned into Mussoorie's [[Wynberg Allen School]].

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats.

The city is famous for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products.\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|right|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]].
