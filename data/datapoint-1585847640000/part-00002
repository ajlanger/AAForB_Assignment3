''The Legend of the Sacred Sword''}}, is a [[high fantasy]] [[action role-playing game]] series created by [[Koichi Ishii]], with development formerly from [[Square (video game company)|Square]], and is currently owned by [[Square Enix]]. The series began as a handheld [[side story]] to Square's [[flagship]] franchise ''[[Final Fantasy]];'' however, the ''Final Fantasy'' elements were subsequently dropped starting with the second installment, ''Secret of Mana'', in order to become its own series. It has grown to include games of various genres within the [[fictional universe|fictional world]] of Mana, with recurring stories involving a [[world tree]], its associated holy sword, and the fight against forces that would steal their power. Several character designs, creatures, and musical themes reappear frequently.\n\nFour games were released in the series between 1991 and 1999: the original ''Seiken Densetsu'' (1991)\u2014''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' in North America and ''Mystic Quest'' in Europe\u2014for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' (1993) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Trials of Mana]]'' (1995) for the Super Famicom, and ''[[Legend of Mana]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. A remake of the original game, ''[[Sword of Mana]]'' (2003), was published for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. All of the original games were action role-playing games, though they included a wide variety of gameplay mechanics, and the stories of the games were connected only thematically.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, four more games were released as part of the ''World of Mana'' subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were ''[[Children of Mana]]'' (2006), an action-oriented [[dungeon crawl]]er game for the [[Nintendo DS]]; ''[[Dawn of Mana]]'' (2006), a 3D [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]; ''Friends of Mana'' (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer [[role-playing game]] for mobile phones; and ''[[Heroes of Mana]]'' (2007), a [[real-time strategy]] game for the DS. ''Children'' was developed by [[Nex Entertainment]] and ''Heroes'' by [[Brownie Brown]], founded by several developers of ''Legends'', though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the ''World of Mana'' subseries ended: ''Circle of Mana'' (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the [[GREE]] mobile platform, ''[[Rise of Mana]]'' (2014), a Japan-only [[free-to-play]] action role-playing game for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[PlayStation Vita]], and ''[[Adventures of Mana]]'' (2016), a 3D remake of ''Final Fantasy Adventure'' for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the ''Mana'' franchise.\n\nThe ''Mana'' series reception has been very uneven, with early games rated higher by critics than more recent titles. ''Secret of Mana'' have been regarded as one of the best 2D action role-playing games ever made, and their music has inspired several orchestral concerts, while the games from the ''World of Mana'' series have been rated considerably lower. As of March 2011, ''Mana'' series titles have sold over 6 million units.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== History ===\n\nSquare trademarked ''Seiken Densetsu'' in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0 |title=\u7b2c\uff12\uff11\uff13\uff12\uff18\uff14\uff14\u53f7 |date=April 28, 1989 |work=\u5546\u6a19\u51fa\u9858\u30fb\u767b\u9332\u60c5\u5831 |publisher=Industrial Property Digital Library (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s11fWfU4?url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0&121328440000000000000000000000000000000000_TM_simple.html&128192419529851902764802 |archivedate=August 16, 2010 }}</ref> intending to use it for a game project subtitled ''The Emergence of Excalibur'', and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]].

Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded.

Densetsu'''''|\u8056\u5263\u4f1d\u8aac||lit. ''The Legend of the Sacred Sword''}}, is a [[high fantasy]] [[action role-playing game]] series created by [[Koichi Ishii]], with development formerly from [[Square (video game company)|Square]], and is currently owned by [[Square Enix]]. The series began as a handheld [[side story]] to Square's [[flagship]] franchise ''[[Final Fantasy]];'' however, the ''Final Fantasy'' elements were subsequently dropped starting with the second installment, ''Secret of Mana'', in order to become its own series. It has grown to include games of various genres within the [[fictional universe|fictional world]] of Mana, with recurring stories involving a [[world tree]], its associated holy sword, and the fight against forces that would steal their power. Several character designs, creatures, and musical themes reappear frequently.\n\nFour games were released in the series between 1991 and 1999: the original ''Seiken Densetsu'' (1991)\u2014''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' in North America and ''Mystic Quest'' in Europe\u2014for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' (1993) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Trials of Mana]]'' (1995) for the Super Famicom, and ''[[Legend of Mana]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. A remake of the original game, ''[[Sword of Mana]]'' (2003), was published for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. All of the original games were action role-playing games, though they included a wide variety of gameplay mechanics, and the stories of the games were connected only thematically.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, four more games were released as part of the ''World of Mana'' subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were ''[[Children of Mana]]'' (2006), an action-oriented [[dungeon crawl]]er game for the [[Nintendo DS]]; ''[[Dawn of Mana]]'' (2006), a 3D [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]; ''Friends of Mana'' (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer [[role-playing game]] for mobile phones; and ''[[Heroes of Mana]]'' (2007), a [[real-time strategy]] game for the DS. ''Children'' was developed by [[Nex Entertainment]] and ''Heroes'' by [[Brownie Brown]], founded by several developers of ''Legends'', though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the ''World of Mana'' subseries ended: ''Circle of Mana'' (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the [[GREE]] mobile platform, ''[[Rise of Mana]]'' (2014), a Japan-only [[free-to-play]] action role-playing game for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[PlayStation Vita]], and ''[[Adventures of Mana]]'' (2016), a 3D remake of ''Final Fantasy Adventure'' for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the ''Mana'' franchise.\n\nThe ''Mana'' series reception has been very uneven, with early games rated higher by critics than more recent titles. ''Secret of Mana'' have been regarded as one of the best 2D action role-playing games ever made, and their music has inspired several orchestral concerts, while the games from the ''World of Mana'' series have been rated considerably lower. As of March 2011, ''Mana'' series titles have sold over 6 million units.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== History ===\n\nSquare trademarked ''Seiken Densetsu'' in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0 |title=\u7b2c\uff12\uff11\uff13\uff12\uff18\uff14\uff14\u53f7 |date=April 28, 1989 |work=\u5546\u6a19\u51fa\u9858\u30fb\u767b\u9332\u60c5\u5831 |publisher=Industrial Property Digital Library (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s11fWfU4?url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0&121328440000000000000000000000000000000000_TM_simple.html&128192419529851902764802 |archivedate=August 16, 2010 }}</ref> intending to use it for a game project subtitled ''The Emergence of Excalibur'', and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]].

Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded.
