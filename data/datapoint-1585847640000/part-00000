In the 1880 [[United States Census]], [[Ivan Petrof (explorer)|Ivan Petrof]] recorded 702 residents in nine villages on the island. An epidemic in 1900 decimated the population of the island. [[Emigration]] keeps the population small.  Of the noted persons who have visited Nunivak are photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]], Anne Makepeace, anthropologist Margaret Lantis, and the artist Muriel Hannah. Noted conservationist and outdoorsman [[Steven Rinella]] aired an episode of his television show Meat Eater in 2015 where he experienced a muskox hunt and explored the history and culture of the island and its people. \n[[File:Nunivak maskette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Masks among Eskimo peoples|Maskette]]{{spaced ndash}}Nunivak]]\nNearly all the permanent residents of Nunivak are [[Nunivak Cup'ig people|Cup'it Eskimo]], whose traditional language is a dialect of [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]] known as Cup'ig or [[Nunivak Cup'ig language|Nunivak Cup'ig]].  Cup'ig is the first language for many older islanders and is enjoying a dedicated revival among younger islanders as well, although nearly all ''Nuniwarmiut'' (Nunivak people) speak English. The people of Nunivak Island still depend to a large degree on subsistence hunting, and also commercial fishing and industrial work on the mainland.\n\n==Geology and natural history==\n\n[[File:Nunivak 2000 USCGS.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nunivak \u2013 detail from NOAA Bering Sea chart (2000)]]\n[[File:NunivakCliffsFWS726.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bering Sea cliffs, Nunivak]]\n[[File:DunesNunivakFWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Sand dunes and vegetation, Nunivak Island]]\n[[File:RoundupNunivak1964FWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Reindeer roundup, June 1964]]\n[[File:NashHarborNunivakCurtisLOC3c07326v.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nash Harbor, Nunivak; 1927 showing bay, houses, and the mouth of the Ellikarrmiut River.]]\nNunivak Island is volcanic in origin; most of the island is dominated by [[volcanic plateau]] 500&nbsp;ft (160 m) or more above sea level. The island is dotted with about 60 [[Volcanic cone|cinder cones]] and four [[maar]]s. Much of its surface consists of widespread, thin flows of [[lava|pahoehoe lava]] from small [[shield volcano]]es, which spread over [[sedimentary rock]] of the [[Cretaceous]] period. Volcanic eruptions took place during 5 periods of activity beginning 6.1 million years ago. Most of the volcanic field was formed during the two most recent eruptive periods during the [[Pleistocene]] ending about 300,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=314020|title=Global Volcanism Program {{!}} Nunivak Island|website=volcano.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref><ref name=\"avo\">{{cite web|title=Nunivak Island description and statistics|work=Alaska Volcano Observatory|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2007-04-13|url=http://www.avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/volcinfo.php?volcname=Nunivak+Island}}</ref> Because of the history of volcanic activity, it is considered part of the [[Bering Sea Volcanic Province]].<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18973779 The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar chronology and eruption rates of Cenozoic volcanism in the eastern Bering Sea Volcanic Province, Alaska]</ref> The [[Ibkilwit Lava Bed]] is located on Nunivak Island.\n\n[[Tundra]] is the main landscape feature; the largest trees on Nunivak are dwarf [[willow]] trees, most less than 4&nbsp;ft (1.2 m) tall. More than 40 rivers drain the tundra upland.  Brackish lagoons ring the eastern and southern shores, and steep volcanic cliffs dominate the northwest shores.\n\nAt least 89 migratory seabird and waterfowl species have seasonal homes on Nunivak Island, including several endangered and threatened species. Dense summer breeding rookeries are found on all shores of the island and in inland tundra lakes.\n\nPrehistorically, Nunivak was home to a modest herd of [[reindeer|caribou]], but these were exterminated after the introduction of firearms in the late 19th or early 20th century. United States Fish and Wildlife introduced [[reindeer]] and [[musk ox]] onto the island in the 1930s and 1940s. Large herds of these animals are maintained by the local Native Corporation of [[Mekoryuk, Alaska|Mekoryuk]].\n\nMost of the island is part of the [[Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge]], administered by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]].\n\n==Culture==\n\nThe art of Nunivak Island has its roots in the ancient past.  The oldest known sculpture is thousands of years old.\n\nIn the ancient times masks were made to sell or trade for goods needed to survive. Later masks were intended for festivities, [[Yup'ik dancing|dances]], and traditional healing.\n\nThis type of mask (there are many types of masks carved today) represents the life surrounding Nunivak Island.  The walrus is what the loon depends on for survival.  And, in turn, man depends on the loon and the walrus for survival.  These are two of the traditional animals that were hunted by the men of the village in order to provide for their families.\n\nThe walrus is what the Nunivak peoples depended on to survive.  It held much of the necessities of living in the Bering Sea.  The skin of the walrus was used for waterproofing kayaks, the soles of mukluks ([[Cup'ig boots]]), and the intestine was used as waterproof rain gear that were of great necessity in earlier times.  The bones were used as tools, the ivory for spear heads, and harpoon heads and carvings were made for trade.  Also the loon pelts were transformed into beautiful winter coats that were also waterproof.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 400\n|1910= 127 \n|1920= 189\n|1930= 191\n|1940= 225\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nNunivak Island first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated island, with 400 Yupik residents.<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf</ref> In 1890, the villages on the island reported separately.

These are two of the traditional animals that were hunted by the men of the village in order to provide for their families.\n\nThe walrus is what the Nunivak peoples depended on to survive.  It held much of the necessities of living in the Bering Sea.  The skin of the walrus was used for waterproofing kayaks, the soles of mukluks ([[Cup'ig boots]]), and the intestine was used as waterproof rain gear that were of great necessity in earlier times.  The bones were used as tools, the ivory for spear heads, and harpoon heads and carvings were made for trade.  Also the loon pelts were transformed into beautiful winter coats that were also waterproof.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 400\n|1910= 127 \n|1920= 189\n|1930= 191\n|1940= 225\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nNunivak Island first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated island, with 400 Yupik residents.<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf</ref> In 1890, the villages on the island reported separately.
