Curran was an attacking [[midfielder]], who could also play as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]], he could also play as an out and out [[Striker (association football)|striker]]. During his 13-year career Curran played for many clubs, although he is especially remembered by [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] supporters for his part in launching the clubs revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n==Football career==\nTerry Curran was born in Kinsley, near [[Hemsworth]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] on 20 March 1955, he signed for Fourth Division [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in July 1973 from non-league football. He made 68 appearances for Rovers scoring 11 goals in two seasons. [[Brian Clough]] was wanting to sign him but was put off by the asking price of \u00a3140,000 so he controversially told Curran's brother of his interest so Curran would not sign a new contract, thus reducing the transfer fee. He signed for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in August 1975 with Rovers receiving \u00a350,000 plus keeper [[Dennis Peacock]] and winger [[Ian Miller (Scottish footballer)|Ian Miller]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|title=Brain Clough: Nobody Ever Says Thank You: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QT5TaWjxPwC&pg=PR4-IA3&lpg=PR4-IA3&dq=Terry+Curran+Ian+Miller+Dennis+Peacock#v=onepage&q=Terry%20Curran%20Ian%20Miller%20Dennis%20Peacock&f=false|isbn=9781409123187|date=2011-11-10}}</ref> In two seasons, he played 48 games scoring 12 goals for Forest, helping them gain promotion to Division One in the 1976\u201377 season. Curran lost favour after a disagreement with Forest assistant manager [[Peter Thomas Taylor|Peter Taylor]], and made a written transfer request in August 1977, which was accepted.<ref>{{cite news|title=CLOUGH GETS TOUGH: CURRAN CAN GO|date=28 August 1977|newspaper=Sunday Mirror|page=39|first=Vince|last=Wilson}}</ref> He was loaned out to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] during October 1977 and eventually switched to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in a \u00a350,000 move the following month.\n\nCurran stayed less than a year at Derby, making 26 appearances in Division One scoring two goals before switching for \u00a360,000 to another First Division club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1978. Once again Curran stayed less than a year at Southampton, making 26 appearances in the 1978\u201379 season and playing in the League Cup semi-final victory over Leeds United. It was after that semi-final in January 1979 that Curran was approached by Sheffield Wednesday manager [[Jack Charlton]] with the audacious request that Curran should drop down two divisions and sign for Third Division Sheffield Wednesday. Curran agreed to Charlton's approach and signed for Wednesday for \u00a3100,000 in March 1979. Curran started the [[1979 Football League Cup Final|1979 League Cup Final]] defeat to his former club Nottingham Forest.\n\nCurran's signing proved to an inspired acquisition for Wednesday, he was the final piece of Jack Charlton's side which went on to gain promotion from Division Three in the 1979\u201380 season. He was an immensely popular and successful player during his time at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], scoring 24 goals in that promotion season. Such was his popularity that he had his own fan club and recorded a song called \"[[Singing the Blues]]\". Curran was involved in an incident the following season in a match at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham]] on 6 September 1980 when he was sent off after a fracas with [[Simon Stainrod]] causing Wednesday fans to riot, which led to the closure of Hillsborough terraces for the next four home games.\n\nCurran stayed with Wednesday till the end of the 1981\u201382 season, he never repeated the scoring exploits of that first season and the team had a new goal ace in [[Gary Bannister]], this and a deteriorating relationship with Jack Charlton led him to leave and sign for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for \u00a3100,000. He made 33 appearances for United scoring 3 goals before moving to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for three years (having spent on time on loan there the previous season) during which time he made only 24 appearances. He was at the club when they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1984\u201385 Football League|1984-85 season]], a triumph to which Curran contributed 9 appearances.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/team_performance/everton-fc/eng-premier-league-1984-1985/\n|title=Everton FC \u00bb Appearances Premier League 1984/1985\n|publisher=worldfootball.net\n|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> He then played briefly at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] before going abroad to play for Greek club [[Panionios NFC]]. He returned in October 1986 to play short spells for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] before retiring from playing in 1988.\n\n==Coaching career==\nSince retiring Curran has managed non-league [[Goole Town F.C.|Goole Town]] and [[Mossley
