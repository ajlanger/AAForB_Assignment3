A large clinical problem was women with chronic pelvic pain. Together with another physiotherapist, Tove Boe, she developed a new group treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain with focus on a psychosomatic approach. Combining qualitative actions research methods with quantitative measurements of improvements, the results showed that the patients improved significantly. This research was published in her Master's thesis and a scientific paper.<ref>'''Albert H.''' Psychosomatic group treatment helps women with chronic pelvic pain. J Psychosom Obstret Gynecol 1999;20:216-25</ref>\n\nThe large number of pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain, was a challenge at the obstetric department. Little was known about the diagnosis and treatment of this painful condition in pregnant and post-partum women. Together with another physiotherapists Mona Godskesen, she undertook the challenge of attempting to classify the different groups of Pelvic Girdle pain into subgroups which required different treatment. The study (still the largest in the world) included 2269 pregnant women. All of them were examined in their 20. week of pregnancy. The women who suffered from pelvic pain were followed at 1, 3,6,12, 24 months after delivery, or until their pelvic pain subsided. The main findings of the study were, that there are most likely four different subgroups of pelvic girdle pain.  Then different groups have different incidence, and there is different clinical characteristics and pain pattern and different prognosis. Most important is the subgroups; Pelvic Girdle Syndrome, 5% of the pregnant women suffer from Pelvic Girdle Syndrome. Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. \nThis research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | last4 = Chard | first4 = T | last5 = Gunn | first5 = L | year = 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J obstet Gynecol Reproductive biology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 19\u201322 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of clinical tests used in classification procedures in pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 161\u20136 | doi = 10.1007/s005860050228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2001 | title = Prognosis of four classification groups of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 505\u201310 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080006505.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2002 | title = Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2831\u20134 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200212150-00020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Korsholm | first3 = L | last4 = Westergaard | first4 = JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk Factors in developing Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstetrica et Gynecologica | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 539\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600578415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2002 | title = Behandling af b\u00e6kken- og l\u00e6nderygsmerter hos gravide og post partum kvinder | url = | journal = Muskuloskelatalt forum | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16\u201321 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2012 | title = B\u00e6kkensmerter i graviditeten - forekomst, prognose, risikofaktorer og diagnostisering | url = | journal = Best Practice | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23\u201325 }}</ref> For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.\n\n===Disc herniation===\nIn 2000 Dr. Hanne Albert was employed as a researcher and a Ph.D. student at The Back Centre in Ringe. The aim of her Ph.D. was, to evaluate the possibility of treating to treat patients with severe lumbar disc herniation with exercises. These were patients who would normally be considered surgical candidates. In 2000, this had not previously been shown. The study showed, that there was highly significant improvement in patients of this kind of treatment. It was also possible to specify the patient's prognoses by dividing the patients into different response to Specific exercises and positioning (McKenzie), different personally traits, and different types of herniation and these subgroups required different treatment.<ref>Albert HB.

About 50% of the patients developed Modic Changes/bone edema in the vertebrae adjacent to the previously herniated, this was visible one year after their disc herniation. These patients also developed back pain, whereas the main problem that they presented while having the lumbar disc herniation was pain radiating into one or both legs. Hanne Albert was the first to describe this connection between a previous herniation and new Modic changes in the adjacent vertebra. For this research she was awarded a price and these results were published as a scientific paper.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Manniche | first2 = C | year = 2007 | title = Modic changes following lumbar disc herniation | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 977\u201382 }}</ref> This was unknown news and led her together with radiologist, Joan Solg\u00e5rd S\u00f8rensen, to develop three theories of the pathogenesis behind Modic changes; a bacterial cause, a mechanical cause and a rheumatological cause. This theory was published in 2007.<ref>'''Albert HB''', Kjaer P, Jensen TS, Sorensen JS, Bendix T, Manniche C \"Modic changes, possible causes and relation to low back pain. Med Hypotheses. 2008;70:361-8. </ref>\n\n===Bacteria as a cause of back pain===\nThe new idea that was presented was, that through a lesion in the herniated disc the bacteria Propioni Acnes could invade the disc, and that Modic changes/bone edema was the edema surrounding the infected disc. Antibiotic treatment was a relevant treatment of an infection. The first study of antibiotic treatment of Modic changes ever, was published in 2008. Here 32 patients in a pilot study was treated with long term antibiotic and 60% of these became much better or cured for their back pain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In 2013, the first randomized clinically controlled trial (RCT) was published.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This study which has received the highest grade in methodology, showed in 162 patients a highly significant and clinically relevant improvement in the patients that received the antibiotic treatment and no change in the patients that received the placebo tablets. This naturally stirred massive international interest.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/07/antibiotics-cure-back-pain-patients \"Antibiotics could cure 40% of chronic back pain patients\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tuesday 7 May 2013.

Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. \nThis research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | last4 = Chard | first4 = T | last5 = Gunn | first5 = L | year = 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J obstet Gynecol Reproductive biology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 19\u201322 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of clinical tests used in classification procedures in pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 161\u20136 | doi = 10.1007/s005860050228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2001 | title = Prognosis of four classification groups of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 505\u201310 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080006505.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2002 | title = Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2831\u20134 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200212150-00020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Korsholm | first3 = L | last4 = Westergaard | first4 = JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk Factors in developing Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstetrica et Gynecologica | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 539\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600578415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2002 | title = Behandling af b\u00e6kken- og l\u00e6nderygsmerter hos gravide og post partum kvinder | url = | journal = Muskuloskelatalt forum | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16\u201321 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2012 | title = B\u00e6kkensmerter i graviditeten - forekomst, prognose, risikofaktorer og diagnostisering | url = | journal = Best Practice | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23\u201325 }}</ref> For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.\n\n===Disc herniation===\nIn 2000 Dr. Hanne Albert was employed as a researcher and a Ph.D. student at The Back Centre in Ringe. The aim of her Ph.D. was, to evaluate the possibility of treating to treat patients with severe lumbar disc herniation with exercises. These were patients who would normally be considered surgical candidates. In 2000, this had not previously been shown. The study showed, that there was highly significant improvement in patients of this kind of treatment. It was also possible to specify the patient's prognoses by dividing the patients into different response to Specific exercises and positioning (McKenzie), different personally traits, and different types of herniation and these subgroups required different treatment.<ref>'''Albert HB'''.

About 50% of the patients developed Modic Changes/bone edema in the vertebrae adjacent to the previously herniated, this was visible one year after their disc herniation. These patients also developed back pain, whereas the main problem that they presented while having the lumbar disc herniation was pain radiating into one or both legs. Hanne Albert was the first to describe this connection between a previous herniation and new Modic changes in the adjacent vertebra. For this research she was awarded a price and these results were published as a scientific paper.<ref>'''Albert HB''',  Manniche C. Modic changes following lumbar disc herniation. Eur Spine J. 2007;16:977-82. Epub 2007 Mar 3.</ref> This was unknown news and led her together with radiologist, Joan Solg\u00e5rd S\u00f8rensen, to develop three theories of the pathogenesis behind Modic changes; a bacterial cause, a mechanical cause and a rheumatological cause. This theory was published in 2007.<ref>'''Albert HB''', Kjaer P, Jensen TS, Sorensen JS, Bendix T, Manniche C Modic changes, possible causes and relation to low back pain. Med Hypotheses. 2008;70:361-8. Epub 2007 Jul 10.</ref>\n\n===Bacteria as a cause of back pain===\nThe new idea that was presented was, that through a lesion in the herniated disc the bacteria Propioni Acnes could invade the disc, and that Modic changes/bone edema was the edema surrounding the infected disc. Antibiotic treatment was a relevant treatment of an infection. The first study of antibiotic treatment of Modic changes ever, was published in 2008. Here 32 patients in a pilot study was treated with long term antibiotic and 60% of these became much better or cured for their back pain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In 2013, the first randomized clinically controlled trial (RCT) was published.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This study which has received the highest grade in methodology, showed in 162 patients a highly significant and clinically relevant improvement in the patients that received the antibiotic treatment and no change in the patients that received the placebo tablets. This naturally stirred massive international interest.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/07/antibiotics-cure-back-pain-patients \"Antibiotics could cure 40% of chronic back pain patients\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tuesday 7 May 2013.
