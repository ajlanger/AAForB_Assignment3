Among guitar and bass accessories, the company sells active humbucker pickups, such as the [[EMG 81]],<ref name=\"humbucker\"/> the [[EMG 85]], the [[EMG 60]], and the [[EMG 89]]. They also produce passive pickups such as the [[EMG HZ|EMG-HZ Series]], which include SRO-OC1's and SC Sets. There is also a series geared towards a more traditional and passive sound known as the X series.\n\nTheir active pickups are most popular among [[hard rock]] and [[metal (music)|metal]] artists<ref name=\"humbucker\"/> such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Zakk Wylde]], [[Sepultura]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Exodus_(American_band)|Exodus]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[Death Angel]], [[Cryptopsy]], [[Malevolent Creation]] and [[Primus (band)|Primus]] but also used by others such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Kyle Sokol]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Steve Lukather]] and [[David Gilmour]].<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded in 1976 by Rob Turner in [[Long Beach, California]]. It was originally called Dirtywork Studios, and their first pickup was the same as their current 2011 model of EMG H and EMG HA models. The active [[humbucking]] pickup EMG 58 followed soon after. The name was changed to \"Overlend\"<ref name=\"wylde\"/> (spelled \"Overland\" in some sources<ref name=\"book\"/>) in 1978. However, its products have always been called EMG pickups.\n\nIn 1981, EMG active pickups became standard equipment on [[Steinberger]] basses and guitars. According to Hap Kuffner, EMG pickups originally had widespread success in [[Europe]], after first exhibiting at the 1983 [[Musikmesse]] tradeshow in Germany. The name was changed to EMG, Inc. in 1983<ref name=\"wylde\"/> (\"EMG\" stands for \"[[Electromagnetism|Electro-Magnetic]] [[Electrical generator|Generator]]\"<ref name=\"emg-history\"/>). As Steinberger guitars became more popular among American metal and rock musicians, so did EMG pickups, and vice versa.<ref name=\"wylde\"/>\n\nEarly EMG pickup designs were made with a bar magnet inside for two reasons. The first reason is that the pole pieces had too much magnetism on the strings and could cause some lower notes to go out of pitch in a [[Doppler effect]]. The second reason is that the pole pieces can make tuning and placement of the strings much more difficult. Using the bar magnet however gave the strings a more balanced output. The design of the bar magnet gives it a smoother distortion, better sustain through the amplifier, and have less fade onto the strings than the design of pole pieces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emgpickups.com/pdfs/EMG_Catalog.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729142420/http://www.emgpickups.com/pdfs/EMG_Catalog.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Products ==\n\n===Overview===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EMG 81.png|thumb|[[EMG-81]]: one of the most popular active EMG pickups]] -->EMG [[guitar pickup|pickups]] are standard equipment on some models from guitar manufacturers such as [[BC Rich]], [[ESP Guitars|ESP]], [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]], [[Cort Guitars|Cort]], [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Dean Guitar|Dean]], [[Ibanez]], and [[Jackson Guitars]].<ref name=\"wylde\"/> In addition to pickups, EMG Inc. also has a line of guitar and bass accessories, mainly for altering [[equalization (audio)|equalization settings]] such as [[Bass (sound)|bass]]/treble and gain boosting, and designed to work with most pickups. These can be found in instruments made by companies such as [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]], who ship almost all of their [[bass guitar|basses]] with EMG equalization circuitry.\n\n=== Pickup product range ===\nEMG Inc. has four distinct product ranges; the EMG Standard Series, HZ / SRO Series, SA Series and the EMG X-Series. These pickups are all featured on the official EMG Inc. website and include [[solder]]less wiring harnesses.\n\n;Standard Series\nThe Standard Series consists of all their standard active guitar, bass, and acoustic pickups, including humbucking, single coil, and bass models for 4, 5, and 6 string basses. EMG [[Pickup (music technology)#Active and passive pickups|active]] pickups (such as the [[EMG 60]], [[EMG 81]], [[EMG 85]], and [[EMG 89]]) tend to have much higher [[Pickup (music technology)#Output|output]] than [[Pickup (music technology)#Active and passive pickups|passive]] pickups of similar design (such as the [[EMG HZ]]) because of the on-board [[preamplifier]].  The high output, noise-reduction and responsiveness of EMG active pickups has made them popular with [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] guitarists because they [[overdrive (music)|overdrive]] the input stage of [[guitar amplifiers]] more dramatically than a lower output pickup could. In 2012 EMG introduced a new 57/66 set to replace the outdated [[EMG 60]] and [[EMG 81]] configuration in which the designs were based off the [[James Hetfield]] \"JH Het Set\" to mix high output from a passive pickup with the punch of the active pickups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.licklibrary.com/news/2012/10/4241-richie_faulkner_and_andy_james__emg_57__66|title=Richie Faulkner And Andy James - EMG 57 + 66}}</ref>\n\n;HZ / SRO Series\nThe HZ / SRO Series is a variety of passive designs of humbucking and single coil pickups, as well as bass models for 4, 5, and 6 string basses. [[EMG HZ|HZ pickup]]s are commonly used in guitar and bass manufacturers as stock pickups.\n\n;SA Series\nThe SA Series is an active single coil pick up with moderate gain output levels famous among Fender Strat players for extra volume and gain while retaining that classic vintage tone.\n \n[[File:EMG-PX.jpg|thumb|EMG P-X -pickups on a bass guitar.]]\n\n;X-Series\nThe X series is an active product designed to bridge the gulf between passive and active tonalities. They are active but are voiced to sound more organic, with a more rounded signal response like the passives, while retaining the active qualities such as noise reduction and high output.\n\n;Signature Pickups and Sets\nEMG has released several signature pickups and sets for various artists, the two longest signature artists being [[Kerry King]] (\"KFK Set\") and [[Zakk Wylde]] (\"ZW Set\"), both are which are based around the EMG 81 and EMG 85 set. There are also signature sets for Judas Priest's [[Glenn Tipton]] (\"GTV Vengenace\" set custom-made for Glenn, based on the 81 / 81 set with steel magnets), [[James Hetfield]] (\"JH HET Set\", set custom-made for Hetfield based on the 81 / 60 set with pole-pieces), [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus']] [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] (\"GH Set\", based around the 81 / 89R in red covers), [[Children of Bodom]]'s [[Alexi Laiho]] (passive custom EMG pickup with a custom-voiced boost preamp), and [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Geezer Butler]] (passive P and P/J voiced for Butler).\n\n==Endorsements==\nSome artists and bands who use or endorse EMG pickups include:\n\n* [[James Hetfield]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Rob Trujillo]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Kirk Hammet]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Slayer]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Sepultura]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n*[[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]<ref name=\"wylde\"/>\n* [[Cannibal Corpse]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[David Gilmour]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Welcome to the Machines| work=Guitar World| author=Tolinski, Brad| url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t11634-phil-taylor-welcome-machines-guitar.html| date=September 1994| accessdate=2011-07-29| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724013318/http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t11634-phil-taylor-welcome-machines-guitar.html| archivedate=2011-07-24}}</ref>\n* [[El Hefe]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Jim Root]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Killswitch Engage]]<ref name=\"wylde\"/>\n* [[Les Claypool]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Kyle Sokol]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Rammstein]]<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Zakk Wylde]]\n* [[Black Veil Brides]]<ref\nname=\"artistlist\"/>\n* [[Nickelback]]\n* [[Reb Beach]]\n* [[Vito Bratta]]\n* [[Matt Heafy]]\n* [[David Ellefson]]\n* [[Ricky Phillips]]\n* [[Jason Newsted]]\n* [[Children Of Bodom]]\n* [[Geezer Butler]]\n* [[Mikey Way]]\n* [[Dan Jacobs (guitarist)|Dan Jacobs]]\n* [[Adam Darski]]\n* [[Aaron Fink (musician)|Aaron Fink]]\n* [[Adam Duce]]\n* [[Andy James]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book\n|title = Guitar Electronics For Musicians\n|first = Donald\n|last = Brosnac\n|publisher = Omnibus Press\n|year = 1983\n|isbn = 978-0-7119-0232-9\n|page = 40\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"wylde\">{{cite magazine\n|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/Magazine/Issue/2010/Sep/EMG_The_Active_Pickup_Makers_Celebrate_35_Years_of_Pioneering_Tone.aspx\n|title=EMG: The Active Pickup Makers Celebrate 35 Years of Pioneering Tone\n|last=Charupakorn\n|first=Joe\n|date=September 2010\n|magazine=[[Premier Guitar]]\n|accessdate=2011-04-13}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"emg-history\">{{cite news|url=http://www.emginc.com/pages/company |title=Company, History |url-status=dead |publisher=EMG Pickups |accessdate=2011-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122095248/https://emginc.com/pages/company |archivedate=November 22, 2010 }}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=November 2015}}\n\n<ref name=\"humbucker\">{{cite magazine\n|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/Magazine/Issue/2008/Jun/EMG_81TW_Active_Humbucker.aspx\n|title=EMG-81TW Active Humbucker\n|last=Rardin\n|first=Kenny\n|date=June 2008\n|magazine=[[Premier Guitar]]\n|accessdate=2011-04-13}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"artistlist\">{{cite news\n|url=http://www.emgpickups.com/artist/index\n|title=EMG Artists Roster\n|date=\n|publisher=EMG Pickups\n|accessdate=2015-11-27}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=November 2015}}\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.emgpickups.com/}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSZy5oWl9hw ''Premier Guitar'' Video: EMG Inc.
