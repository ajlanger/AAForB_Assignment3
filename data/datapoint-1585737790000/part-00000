The first song she ever sang on Swedish television was \"Varje g\u00e5ng jag ser dig\" ''(Each time I see you)'', a soul ballad with a strong love lyrics. Throughout the competition she continued to impress with her vocals in songs like [[Flashdance... What a Feeling]], [[I'm So Excited]], [[Young Hearts Run Free]] and [[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]. Already in this early stage of her career she cited legendary soul-singer [[Stevie Wonder]] as her inspiration.<ref name=\"ac.nu\" /> Both her self-titled debut album and her second album consisted strongly of R&B, soul, and pop songs, continuing the path she began during her time in \"Idol\".\n\nBut after leaving Sony Music and signing on to Roxy, she geared towards the dance and club genre, she was introduced to the songwriter and producer Anders Hansson. Agnes recalls when his name first came up for the album ''\u201c''They said maybe you should just meet first and see if you like each other, as opposed to just working together.\u201d They got on \u2013 so well that Hansson ended up producing an album that helped Agnes realise her vision, Dance Love and Pop together in one album<ref name=\"ac.se\" /> \u201cA lot of things changed for me when I started to work with this album. I really liked it, because I knew that I wanted to do something totally different to the two others. I wanted to do uptempo, disco-orientated songs and I really wanted to work with Anders because he felt the same way.\"<ref name=\"ac.se\" /> When released the first single \"On and On\" from her third album, it immediately showed a clear change of artistic direction for her music. This was clearly observed by the critics who all homaged her new musical style. Other remarks are ''\"The album fits the dance floor at any club. A mood trigger with bubbling enjoyment.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.se/noje/artikel.aspx?articleid=4402301|title=Dance Love Pop|accessdate=2008-11-05|author=Sandra Wall|date=2008-10-29|work=nt.se|publisher=[[Norrk\u00f6pings Tidningar]]}}</ref> and \"''Agnes Carlsson once and for all gets rid of the \"Idol\"-dust.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/noje/skivrecensioner/article1005982.ece|title= Agnes: Dance Love Pop|accessdate=2008-11-05|author=|first=Lisa|last=Appelqvist|date=2008-10-29|work=Kristianstadsbladet|language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAgnes has often cited strong female soul singers like [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Janet Jackson]] as her inspiration in music.
