Remains of settlements are still present on the wood-covered hills to the southwest of town.\n\nAround the 1st century BC, the territory became subject to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The town center was situated on the nearby hills, but it was then moved to its current location by order of [[Julius Caesar]], who had the swamp near the southern tip of the lake drained and laid the plan of the walled city in the typical Roman grid of perpendicular streets. The newly founded town was named ''Novum Comum'' and had the status of ''municipium''. In September 2018, [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Culture Minister]] [[Alberto Bonisoli]] announced the discovery of around several hundred [[gold coin]]s in the basement of the former [[Cressoni Theater]] (Teatro Cressoni) in a two-handled [[soapstone]] [[amphora]], coins struck by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Valentinian III]], [[Leo I the Thracian|Leon I]], [[Antonio]] and [[Libius Severus]] dating to 474AD.<ref name=\"2018-09-10_NPR\">[https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/646445359/hundreds-of-roman-gold-coins-found-in-theater-basement Hundreds Of Roman Gold Coins Found In Theater Basement], Shannon Van Sant, [[NPR]], 2018-09-10</ref>\n\nIn 774, the town surrendered to invading [[Carolingian Empire|Franks]] led by [[Charlemagne]], and became a center of commercial exchange.\n\nIn 1127, Como lost a decade-long war with the nearby town of [[Milan]]. A few decades later, with the help of [[Frederick Barbarossa]], the Comaschi were able to avenge their defeat when Milan was destroyed in 1162. Frederick promoted the construction of several defensive towers around the city limits, of which only one, [[Castello Baradello|the Baradello]], remains.\n\nSubsequently, the history of Como followed that of the [[Duchy of Milan]], through the French invasion and the Spanish domination, until 1714, when the territory was taken by the Austrians. [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] descended into Lombardy in 1796 and ruled it until 1815, when the Austrian rule was resumed after the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Finally in 1859, with the arrival of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the town was freed from the Austrians and it became part of the newly formed [[Italian unification|Kingdom of Italy]] under the [[House of Savoy]].\n\nAt the end of World War II, after passing through Como on his escape towards Switzerland, [[Benito Mussolini]] was taken prisoner and then shot by partisans in [[Giulino di Mezzegra]], a small town on the north shores of [[Lake Como]].\n\nIn 2010, a motion by members of the nationalist [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP) was submitted to the Swiss parliament requesting the [[territorial evolution of Switzerland|admission of adjacent territories]] to the [[Swiss Confederation]]; Como (and its province) is one of these.<ref name=\"Figaro 22 June 2010\">{{cite news|last=Maurisse|first=Marie|title=Quand un d\u00e9put\u00e9 suisse r\u00eave d'annexer la Savoie|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/06/21/01003-20100621ARTFIG00751-quand-un-depute-suisse-reve-d-annexer-la-savoie.php|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=22 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Standard 21 June 2010\">{{cite news|title=SVP-Forderung: Vorarlberg soll Kanton werden|url=http://derstandard.at/1276413676440/SVP-Forderung-Vorarlberg-soll-Kanton-werden|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[Der Standard]]|date=21 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"La Repubblica 22 June 2010\">{{cite news|last=Coen|first=Leonardo|title=L'ultima tentazione di Como: \"Vogliamo diventare svizzeri\"|url=http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/06/22/news/como_svizzera-5043821/|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=22 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Rockefeller fountain that today stands in the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City was once in the main square (Piazza [[Camillo Benso|Cavour]]) by the lakeside.

Como also hosts a prestigious clay-court tennis tournament every year, the [[Citt\u00e0 di Como Challenger]], which attracts many of the world's top players who are not involved in the concurrent [[US Open (tennis)]]. Many players have testified that they much prefer playing in the relaxed and friendly Como environs than the hustle and bustle of [[Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park]].

Remains of settlements are still present on the wood-covered hills to the southwest of town.\n\nAround the 1st century BC, the territory became subject to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The town center was situated on the nearby hills, but it was then moved to its current location by order of [[Julius Caesar]], who had the swamp near the southern tip of the lake drained and laid the plan of the walled city in the typical Roman grid of perpendicular streets. The newly founded town was named ''Novum Comum'' and had the status of ''municipium''. In September 2018, [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Culture Minister]] [[Alberto Bonisoli]] announced the discovery of around several hundred [[gold coin]]s in the basement of the former [[Cressoni Theater]] (Teatro Cressoni) in a two-handled [[soapstone]] [[amphora]], coins struck by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Valentinian III]], [[Leo I the Thracian|Leon I]], [[Antonio]] and [[Libius Severus]] dating to 474AD.<ref name=\"2018-09-10_NPR\">[https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/646445359/hundreds-of-roman-gold-coins-found-in-theater-basement Hundreds Of Roman Gold Coins Found In Theater Basement], Shannon Van Sant, [[NPR]], 2018-09-10</ref>\n\nIn 774, the town surrendered to invading [[Carolingian Empire|Franks]] led by [[Charlemagne]], and became a center of commercial exchange.\n\nIn 1127, Como lost a decade-long war with the nearby town of [[Milan]]. A few decades later, with the help of [[Frederick Barbarossa]], the Comaschi were able to avenge their defeat when Milan was destroyed in 1162. Frederick promoted the construction of several defensive towers around the city limits, of which only one, [[Castello Baradello|the Baradello]], remains.\n\nSubsequently, the history of Como followed that of the [[Duchy of Milan]], through the French invasion and the Spanish domination, until 1714, when the territory was taken by the Austrians. [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] descended into Lombardy in 1796 and ruled it until 1815, when the Austrian rule was resumed after the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Finally in 1859, with the arrival of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the town was freed from the Austrians and it became part of the newly formed [[Italian unification|Kingdom of Italy]] under the [[House of Savoy]].\n\nAt the end of World War II, after passing through Como on his escape towards Switzerland, [[Benito Mussolini]] was taken prisoner and then shot by partisans in [[Giulino di Mezzegra]], a small town on the north shores of [[Lake Como]].\n\nIn 2010, a motion by members of the nationalist [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP) was submitted to the Swiss parliament requesting the [[territorial evolution of Switzerland|admission of adjacent territories]] to the [[Swiss Confederation]]; Como (and its province) is one of these.<ref name=\"Figaro 22 June 2010\">{{cite news|last=Maurisse|first=Marie|title=Quand un d\u00e9put\u00e9 suisse r\u00eave d'annexer la Savoie|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/06/21/01003-20100621ARTFIG00751-quand-un-depute-suisse-reve-d-annexer-la-savoie.php|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=22 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Standard 21 June 2010\">{{cite news|title=SVP-Forderung: Vorarlberg soll Kanton werden|url=http://derstandard.at/1276413676440/SVP-Forderung-Vorarlberg-soll-Kanton-werden|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[Der Standard]]|date=21 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"La Repubblica 22 June 2010\">{{cite news|last=Coen|first=Leonardo|title=L'ultima tentazione di Como: \"Vogliamo diventare svizzeri\"|url=http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/06/22/news/como_svizzera-5043821/|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=22 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Rockefeller fountain that today stands in the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City was once in the main square (Piazza [[Camillo Benso|Cavour]]) by the lakeside.

As a consequence manufacturing is no longer the economic driver, and the city has been absorbed into [[Milan metropolitan area|Milan's metropolitan area]] where it mainly provides workers to the [[service industry]] sector. A significant number of residents are employed in the nearby industrial areas of the Swiss towns of [[Lugano]] and [[Mendrisio]], primarily in the [[industrial sector]], [[health care services]] and in the [[hospitality industry]]; the {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} commute is beneficial as wages in Switzerland are notably higher. For these reasons, tourism has become increasingly important for the local economy since the 1990s. The city and the lake have been [[Lake Como#Depictions in popular culture|chosen as the filming location]] for various recent popular feature films, and this, together with the increasing presence of celebrities who have bought lakeside properties, has heightened the city's international profile and given a further boost to international tourism.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe city of Como has seen its population count increase until it peaked at almost 100,000 inhabitants in the 1970s, when manufacturing, especially the silk industry, was in its boom years. As production began to decline, the population decreased by almost 20,000 people until the start of the 21st century, when the city saw its population grow again by more than six thousand, mainly because of immigration from Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa. As of 31 December 2016, the population was 84,326 people of which 12,026 were resident aliens, that is, 14.1% of the total; the population distribution by origin was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Cittadini Stranieri (Foreigners)|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/013/075/statistiche/stranieri.html|publisher=Comuni Italiani|accessdate= July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n!

Previous champions include [[Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta]], [[Viktor Troicki]] and the 2016 champion [[Kenny de Schepper]] who once again will be eschewing the US Open to defend his crown.\n\n==People==\n\n===Born in Como===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER -->\nPeople born or raised in Como include:\n*[[Pliny the Elder]] (''Gaius Plinius Secundus''; 23\u201379 CE), author, [[natural philosopher]] and naval and military commander known for the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]''\n*Caecilius (c. 59 CE), a poet, the subject of [[Catullus]]'s Carmina 35,<ref>[[:la:s:Carmina (Catullus)/35|Carmina (Catullus)/35]]</ref> who had a girlfriend more learned than the Sapphic Muse<ref name=\"Caecilius\">{{cite book|author=John Hazel|title=Who's who in the Roman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=854lczVIiCkC&pg=PA42|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22410-9|page=42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.let.ru.nl/v.hunink/documents/catullus_md.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719200529/http://www.let.ru.nl/v.hunink/documents/catullus_md.htm |archive-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*[[Pliny the Younger]] (''Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus''; 63\u2013c.113 CE), lawyer, an author and a [[natural philosopher]] of [[Ancient Rome]]\n*[[Agostina Camozzi]] (1435 -
