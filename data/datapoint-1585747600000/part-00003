The building is now owned and used by Brighton [[YMCA]], the largest supported housing provider in Brighton and Hove. Brighton YMCA houses and resettles 311 homeless people of all ages, providing the best opportunities to empower clients to reach their full potential and achieve their aspirations.\n\nDesigned in 1804 by [[William Porden]], who was the architect of many buildings on the Prince's [[Royal Pavilion]] estate and notably of the Royal Pavilion gardens, it was used by Fitzherbert until her death 33 years later. Porden's designs of Steine House were exhibited at the Royal Academy at the time, together with the designs of the Royal Pavilion. In 1870, Brighton YMCA was founded and started to provide accommodation from Steine House for single people such as servicemen and apprentices. In 1884, Brighton YMCA bought the building outright and continue to use it to this day.\n\nAn accidental fire in 2009 caused extensive damage, but Steine House was renovated and its purpose, to house formerly homeless people, maintained. Since 2012, the organisation's Registered Office is at Steine House, whilst a separate part of the building offers self-contained housing to 12 clients with support needs.\n\nAlterations to the building have reduced its architectural importance, but Steine House has been [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade II by [[English Heritage]] for its historical connections.\n\n==History==\nThe Prince Regent (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]) was one of the earliest and most important regular visitors to Brighton in its early years as a resort.  It was transformed from a small fishing village after about 1750 when [[Water cure (therapy)|sea-bathing and drinking seawater]] became fashionable and popular, on the advice of influential local doctor [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Richard Russell]].<ref name=\"NEB296\">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=296.}}</ref><ref name=\"Musgrave46\u201348\">{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|pp=46\u201348.}}</ref>  The Prince's first visit to the town, in 1783 at the age of 21, lasted 11 days and attracted thousands of people eager to see both him and the sights which had attracted him.<ref name=\"NEB137\">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=137.}}</ref>  The following year, he stayed for ten weeks of the summer to take the water cure.
