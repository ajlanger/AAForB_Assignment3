{"title_page": "Hans Steffen", "text_new": "[[image:Hans Steffen IN1916.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Picture of Dr. Hans Steffen in 1916]]\n'''Hans Steffen Hoffman''' (20 July 1865, in [[:de:F\u00fcrstenwerder|F\u00fcrstenwerder]], [[Prussia]] &ndash; 7 April 1936, in [[Davos]], Switzerland) was a [[Germans|German]] geographer and explorer of the [[Ays\u00e9n Region]] in western [[Patagonia]]. Steffen also worked as a [[teacher]], [[encyclopedist]] and historian. [[Steffen Glacier]] on the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field]] is named after him.\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1889, Hans Steffen, who had obtained his doctorate in 1886, was invited by [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]] to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], where he became a teacher of history and geography at the [[UMCE|Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico de Chile]] of the [[University of Chile]] (together with the Germans Alfred Beutell, Friedrich Hanssen, [[Federico Johow|Friedrich Johow]], Rudolf Lenz, Reinhold von Lilienthal, and J\u00fcrgen Heinrich Schneider).\n\nHe was later contracted to join the Chilean boundary commission to explore areas disputed by [[Argentina]] in what is now the [[Ays\u00e9n Region]] of Chile.\n\nThe areas to be explored were those affected by article 1 of the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]]:\n:''\"The boundary between Chile and the Argentine Republic is from north to south, as far as the [[52nd parallel south|52nd parallel]] of latitude, the Cordillera de los Andes. The boundary-line shall run in that extent over the highest summits of the said Cordilleras which divide the waters, and shall pass between the sources (of streams) flowing down to either side. \u2026\"''\nThis article led to dispute between whether the [[continental divide]] would serve as a boundary favouring Chile or the highest peaks favouring Argentina. The two interpretations coincided for most of the boundary but in the Ays\u00e9n Region there were great differences. Before the explorations of Steffen, Chile had made only limited hydrographic surveys along the intricate Pacific coast of Ays\u00e9n. The inland areas in dispute had been mainly explored by Argentines, notably [[Francisco Perito Moreno]].\n\nBetween 1893 and 1894 he explored with the [[Chilean Navy]] the basins of the [[Palena River|Palena]] and [[Puelo River]]s. He explored the [[Manso River (Argentina)|Manso]], [[Ais\u00e9n River|Ais\u00e9n]] and [[Cisnes River]]s from 1896 to 1898. He then moved on to explore the channels south of [[Taitao Peninsula]] ([[46th parallel south|46\u00b0S]]) mapping and describing the [[Gulf of Penas]], and then exploring and naming [[Baker River (Chile)|Baker]], [[Bravo River|Bravo]] and [[Pascua River]]s. He also crossed the [[Isthmus of Ofqui]]. Following the Pascua River, Steffen and his companions were the first to arrive at [[O'Higgins Lake]] from the Pacific as well the first to explore its western arms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Francisco Hudson]]\n*[[Francisco Perito Moreno]]\n*[[Juan Br\u00fcggen]]\n*[[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]]\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.icarito.cl/biografias/articulo/s/2009/12/255-3194-9-steffen-hoffman-hans.shtml Hans Steffen Hoffman]\n* Carlos Sanhueza Cerda: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170815174716/http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/estudios/4972/ El objetivo del Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico no es el de formar ge\u00f3grafos.
