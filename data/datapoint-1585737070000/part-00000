He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

Taylor--> | title=Stalin's Apologist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1990}}</ref> A story Duranty filed about the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] gained him wider notice as a journalist. He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the [[Metro-Vickers Affair|arrest of engineers]] from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces&nbsp;\u2014 the Ukraine, [[North Caucasus Krai|North Caucasus]] [i.e. Kuban Region], and the [[Volga region|Lower Volga]]&nbsp;\u2014 has, however, caused heavy loss of life.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty concluded \"it is conservative to suppose\" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had \"at least trebled.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&lr=#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false ''Assignment in Utopia'' By Eugene Lyons].</ref> The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. ''[[The Nation]]'' then described his reporting as \"the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world.\"<ref name=ConqRav>Conquest, R. ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990).

Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the arrest of engineers from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda.

''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990). [[Joseph Alsop]] and Andrew Stuttaford spoke out against Duranty during the Pulitzer Prize controversy.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Andrew|last=Stuttaford|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|title=Prize Specimen \u2013 The campaign to revoke Walter Duranty's Pulitzer|magazine=[[National Review]]|date=7 May 2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519230426/http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|archivedate=19 May 2003}}</ref> \"Lying was Duranty's stock in trade,\" commented Alsop.

In 1934 he privately reported to the British embassy in Moscow that as many as 10 million people may have died, directly or indirectly, from famine in the Soviet Union in the previous year.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/05/fellow-travellers-and-useful-idiots \"Fellow travelers and useful idiots\", ''The New Statesman'', 8 May 2017].</ref>\n\nBoth [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jQcPAQAAMAAJ ''The Foreign Office and the famine: British documents on Ukraine and the Great Famine of 1932\u20131933''] (Studies in East European nationalisms). \"Duranty&nbsp;... manipulated the official palaver so successfully that it was possible to interpret his article in several ways\", p. xxx.</ref> and American engineer Zara Witkin (1900\u20131940),<ref>{{cite web|first=Joyce |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9951419 |title=Zara Witkin |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=November 23, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> who worked in the USSR from 1932 to 1934,<ref>''An American Engineer in Stalin's Russia: The Memoirs of Zara Witkin, 1932\u20131934'', University of California Press.</ref> confirmed that Duranty knowingly misrepresented information about the nature and scale of the famine.\n\nThere are some indications that Duranty's deliberate misdirection concerning the famine may have been the result of duress. Conquest believed Duranty was being blackmailed over his sexual proclivities.<ref>P. Murphy, ''The Collective Imagination: The Creative Spirit of Free Societies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn his 1944 book, Duranty wrote in a chastened tone about his 1932\u201334 reporting, but he offered only a Stalinist defense of it.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\">{{Harvnb|Duranty|1944|pp=188\u2013199}}</ref> He admits that people starved, including not just \"class enemies\" but also loyal communists,<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> (a reprise of the [[Siberian Intervention]] of a decade earlier)\u2014in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> Although it is likely that Stalin ''did'' expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), most historians today do not accept the view that it was his ''sole'' motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, \"What a misconception!\"<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/>\n\n==Calls for revocation of Pulitzer Prize, 1990\u20132003==\nThe concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.\n\nIn response to ''Stalin's Apologist'' (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away.\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm \"N.Y. Times urged to rescind 1932 Pulitzer\"], retrieved February 2, 2008</ref> The ''Times'' sent Von Hagen's report to the Pulitzer Board and left it to the Board to take whatever action they considered appropriate.<ref>Reported in ''The Washington Times'' \"National\" section, October 22, 2003.</ref> In a letter accompanying the report, ''The New York Times'' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] called Duranty's work \"slovenly\" and said it \"should have been recognized for what it was by his editors and by his Pulitzer judges seven decades ago.\"\n\nUltimately, Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prize board, declined to revoke the award. In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award \"there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.\"<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty \"Statement on Walter Duranty's 1932 Prize\"]</ref>\n\n==Literary awards==\n(''other than Pulitzer'')\n* O.
