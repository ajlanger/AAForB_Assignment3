The cooking of [[Istanbul]], [[Bursa]], [[Izmir]], and rest of the [[Asia Minor]] region inherits many elements of [[Ottoman court]] [[cuisine]], with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over [[bulgur]], [[kofte]]s and a wider availability of vegetable stews (''t\u00fcrl\u00fc''), [[eggplant]], stuffed [[dolma]]s and fish. The cuisine of the [[Black Sea Region]] uses fish extensively, especially the [[European anchovy|Black Sea anchovy]] (''hamsi'') and includes [[maize]] dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. [[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]], and [[Adana]]) is famous for its variety of [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''[[\u015f\u00f6biyet]]'', ''[[Kanafeh|kaday\u0131f]]'', and ''[[k\u00fcnefe]]''.\n\nEspecially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref name=\"multiple\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |title=Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones |access-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429005226/http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. [[Central Anatolia]] has many famous specialties, such as ''[[ke\u015fkek]]'', ''[[mant\u0131]]'' (especially from [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[g\u00f6zleme]]''. Food names directly cognate with ''mant\u0131'' are found also in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (''[[mantou]]'' or steamed bun) and [[Korean cuisine]] (''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'').\n\nA specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between ''Urfa kebap'' and ''[[Adana kebap]]'' is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. ''Urfa kebap'' is less spicy and thicker than ''Adana kebap''. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are the mainstay in Turkish cuisine as presented in foreign countries, native Turkish meals largely center around [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[bread]].\n\n== Culinary customs ==\n\n=== Breakfast ===\n[[File:Simit-2x.JPG|thumb|right|[[Simit]], a circular bread with sesame seeds, is a common breakfast item in Turkey.]]\n\nTurks usually prefer a rich breakfast. A typical Turkish [[breakfast]] consists of cheese (''[[beyaz peynir]]'', ''[[ka\u015far]]'' etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and [[kaymak]], [[Sujuk|sucuk]] (a spicy Turkish sausage, can be eaten with eggs), ''[[past\u0131rma]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'', ''[[simit]]'', ''[[po\u011fa\u00e7a]]'' and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called [[Menemen (food)|menemen]], which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion,  olive oil and eggs. Invariably, [[Turkish tea]] is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, ''kahvalt\u0131'', means \"before coffee\" (''kahve'', 'coffee'; ''alt\u0131'', 'under').\n\n=== Homemade food ===\nHomemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out; Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or [[Mincing|minced]] meat), often with or before rice or [[bulgur]] [[pilav]] accompanied by a salad or [[cac\u0131k]] (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (''[[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131]] yemekler'') instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n[[File:Akcaabatkofte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ak\u00e7aabat meatballs]].]]\nAlthough fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey, Turkish people still rely primarily on the rich and extensive dishes of Turkish cuisine. In addition, some traditional Turkish foods, especially ''[[Kofta|k\u00f6fte]]'', ''[[Doner kebab|d\u00f6ner]]'', ''[[kokore\u00e7]]'', ''[[kumpir]]'' ''midye tava'' ''b\u00f6rek'' and ''g\u00f6zleme'', are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whiting | first=Dominic |year=2000 |title=Turkey Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Cz4zG73sHgC&pg=PA56&dq=lokanta |publisher=Footprint Handbooks |page=56 |isbn=978-1-900949-85-9 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> ''Esnaf lokantas\u0131'' (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.\n\n=== Summer cuisine ===\nIn the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as eggplant (aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] and [[\u00e7\u0131lb\u0131r]] are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer ''summer helva'', which is lighter and less sweet than the regular one.\n\n=== Key ingredients ===\nFrequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include: lamb, beef, rice, fish, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper|green peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[zucchini]]s and [[tomato]]es. Nuts, especially [[pistachio]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[walnut]]s, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. [[Semolina]] flour is used to make a cake called [[Basbousa|''revani'']] and [[Halva|''irmik helvasi'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+Commonly used spices and flavorings:\n!Name\n!Turkish\n!Used in\n!References\n|-\n|[[Allspice]]\n|''Yenibahar'' or ''Dolma bahar''\n|[[Dolma]], vegetables, rice, fish\n|<ref name=akin>{{Cite book| publisher = Abrams| isbn = 978-1-61312-871-8| last = Akin| first = Engin| title = Essential Turkish Cuisine| date = 2015-10-06}}</ref><ref name=basan>{{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-15617-6| last = Basan| first = Ghillie| title = Classic Turkish Cooking| date = 1997-04-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Anise]]\n|''Anason''\n|[[Peksimet]], [[rak\u0131]], used to season nut and dried fruit mixtures in both sweet and savory dishes\n|<ref name=akin /><ref name=basan />\n|-\n|[[Black pepper]]\n|''Kara biber''\n|egg dishes, meat dishes, [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]]\n|<ref name=akin />\n|-\n|[[Cardamom]]\n|''Kakule''\n|Rarely used, mostly in coffee.

[[Beyaz peynir]] and [[yogurt]] are part of many dishes including [[b\u00f6rek]], [[manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[kebab]] and [[Tzatziki|cacik]].\n\n=== Oils and fats ===\n[[Butter]] or [[margarine]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[canola oil]], and [[corn oil]] are widely used for cooking. [[Sesame]], [[hazelnut]], [[peanut]] and [[walnut]] oils are used as well. ''Kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131'' ([[tail fat]] of [[sheep]]) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe rich and diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. [[Plum]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s, along with many kinds of [[citrus]] are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, ''[[compote|komposto]]'' (compote) or ''[[ho\u015faf]]'' (from Persian ''khosh \u00e2b'', literally meaning \"nice water\") are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. ''[[Dolma]]'' and pilaf usually contain currants or raisins. ''Etli yaprak sarma'' (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.\n\n[[Image:\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131 with b\u00f6rek.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131]] with Borek]]\nEggplant ({{lang-tr|patl\u0131can}}) has a special place in the Turkish cuisine.\n\n=== Meats ===\n\nIn some regions, meat, which was mostly eaten only at wedding ceremonies or during the ''Kurban Bayram\u0131'' (''[[Eid ul-Adha]]'') as ''etli pilav'' ([[pilaf]] with meat), has become part of the daily diet since the introduction of industrial production. [[Veal]], formerly shunned, is now widely consumed.\n\nThe main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and [[vegetable]], with names such as ''[[k\u0131ymal\u0131]] fasulye'' (beans with ground meat) or ''k\u0131ymal\u0131 \u0131spanak'' (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with [[yogurt]]).\n\nAlternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as ''sardalya'' (sardines) or ''hamsi'' (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed [[Domestic sheep|lambs]], once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. ''Kuzu \u00e7evirme'', cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.\n\n== Dishes and foods ==\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n[[File:Fresh ayran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Fresh Ayran with a head of foam]]\n\n[[Yogurt]] is an important element in Turkish cuisine.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word ''yo\u011furt''. Yogurt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, k\u00f6fte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat etc.), ''meze'' and a specialty called ''mant\u0131'' (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yogurt is regularly eaten with rice or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, ''s\u00fczme yo\u011furt'' or \"strained yogurt\", is made by straining the yogurt curds from the [[whey]]. One of the most common Turkish drinks, ''[[ayran]]'', is made from yogurt. Also, yogurt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries.\n\n==== Cheeses ====\n[[File:Kaschkawal Kashkaval \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b Balkank\u00e4se Sofia IMG 7650.JPG|thumb|''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' cheese]]\n[[File:Otlu tulum peyniri.jpg|thumb|Varieties of ''[[Tulum cheese|tulum]]'': center \"Otlu tulum peyniri\", or Tulum with herbs, in [[Ankara]]]]\n\nTurkey produces many varieties of [[cheese]], mostly from [[domestic sheep|sheep]]'s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. There are 193 different cheeses in Turkey, but only 8 of these cheeses have geographical indication.<ref>https://www.goturkeytourism.com/things-to-do/10-awesome-turkish-cheeses-you-have-to-taste.html</ref>\n\n* ''[[Beyaz peynir]]'' is a salty [[brined cheese]] taking its name from its white color (\"white cheese\"). It is similar to ''[[feta]]'' but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region ([[Ezine, \u00c7anakkale|Ezine]] or [[Turkish Thrace|Thrace]]) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as ''[[Menemen (food)|menemen]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'' and ''[[Pita|pide]]''.\n* ''[[\u00c7erkez peyniri]]'', means \"[[Circassians|Circassian]] cheese\". It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.\n* ''[[\u00c7\u00f6kelek]]'' is dried [[cottage cheese]]. There are many regional varieties of ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek''. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun. \n* ''[[Kurut]]'' and ''ke\u015f'' are regional names for dried bricks of yogurt made from low-fat milk or from ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek'' made from buttermilk.<ref name=KCheese>{{Cite web| url=http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115070211/http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2013| title=Turkish Cheeses| accessdate=2007-12-07| date=2 June 2005}}</ref>\n* ''[[Kars gravyer cheese|Gravyer]]'' is produced in Turkey as well. Among others, [[Kars]] is famous for this type of cheese.\n* ''[[Hellim]]'' is a salty, firm-textured goat cheese, generally with some mint added, made in [[Northern Cyprus]]. In Turkey, it is common to fry ''hellim'' in a pan in some olive oil.\n* ''[[Ka\u015far]]'' is Turkey's other ubiquitous cheese, a moderately fatty sheep's cheese similar to the Greek ''[[kasseri]]'', sometimes marketed as \"Turkish cheddar\", being closer in consistency and taste to mild [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar-style cheese]] than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured ''ka\u015far'', called fresh ''ka\u015far'', is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular [[Kars]] and Thrace.\n* ''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep's cheese, similar to fresh ''ka\u015far''. The name comes from Romanian word ''ca\u0219caval'', which bears the Italian structure of ''caciocavallo''. \n* ''[[Lor (food)|Lor]]'' is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from ''ka\u015far'' or ''strained yogurt'' manufacture. ''Lor'' is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like \"ek\u015fimik\" and ''h\u00f6\u015fmerim''\n* ''[[Mihali\u00e7 Peyniri|Mihali\u00e7 peyniri]]'' or ''Kelle peyniri'' is a hard sheep's cheese that can be grated, like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihali\u00e7 during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pastorized milk and processed by salt.\n* ''[[Braided cheese|\u00d6rg\u00fc peyniri]]'', \"[[braided cheese]]\", is a specialty from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].\n* ''[[Van herbed cheese|Otlu peynir]]''[[Van herbed cheese]] (\"herbed cheese\") is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep's or goat's milk is used, but more recently cow's milk ''otlu peynir'' has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van [[Ramsons|wild garlic]] is traditional; Bitlis ''otlu peynir'' contains a damp-loving herb known as ''sof otu''. In other areas horse mint (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and ''[[Pimpinella rhodentha]]'' are used.<ref name=KCheese/>\n* ''[[Tulum (cheese)|Tulum]]'' is a mostly sheep's curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum. There are regional varieties of ''tulum peynir'' in such areas as \u0130zmir, \u00d6demi\u015f and Erzincan.<ref name=KCheese/> And each of tulum cheese have very different characteristics.\n\n=== Soups ===\nA Turkish meal usually starts with a thin [[soup]] (''\u00e7orba''). Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being; mercimek ([[lentil]]) \u00e7orbas\u0131, yogurt, or [[wheat]] (often mashed) called [[tarhana]] \u00e7orbas\u0131. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as [[\u0130\u015fkembe soup]] and [[pa\u00e7a]] \u00e7orbas\u0131, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal. Before the popularisation of the typical Turkish breakfast, soup was the default morning meal for some people.\nThe most common soups in Turkish cuisine are:\n[[File:Tuzlama.jpg|thumb|''Tuzlama'', a [[tripe soup]] from Turkey.]]\n[[File:Sulu k\u00f6fte.jpg|thumb|[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]]]\n[[File:Ezogelin soup, bread, and water.jpg|thumb|[[Ezogelin soup]]]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Anal\u0131 k\u0131zl\u0131 soup]]''\n* ''[[Yayla \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Ash reshteh|Eri\u015fte a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Bu\u011fday a\u015f\u0131]]''/''[[Ayran soup|Ayran \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' (which is served cold)\n* ''[[Chorba|Corba]]''\n* ''Domates \u00e7orbas\u0131 '' ([[tomato soup]])\n* ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn \u00e7orbas\u0131'' (wedding soup)\n* ''[[Ek\u015fi A\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Ezogelin soup|Ezogelin \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u0130\u015fkembe \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Keledo\u015f]]''\n* ''Lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[cabbage]] soup)\n* ''[[Mahluta]]''\n* ''Mercimek \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[lentil soup]])\n* ''[[Pa\u00e7a]]''\n* ''[[Paz\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u015eehriye]]''\n* [[Sheep's sorrel soup]]\n* ''[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]''\n* ''[[Sumak a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Tarhana \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''Tavuk'' ([[chicken soup]], with almond becomes \"Bademli Tavuk\")\n* [[Toyga soup]]\n* ''Trabzon [[Fish soup|Bal\u0131k]] \u00e7orbas\u0131''\n* ''[[Tutma\u00e7]]'' (lentil dish with noodles)\n* ''[[Y\u00fcks\u00fck \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Bread ===\n* [[Bazlama]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* ''M\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi'' ([[corn bread]])\n* [[Lavash|Lava\u015f]]\n* [[Poga\u010da|Po\u011fa\u00e7a]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]] (a broad, round and flat bread made of wheat flour)\n* [[Simit]] (known as \"''gevrek''\" in Izmir, another type of ring-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds.

[[Su b\u00f6re\u011fi]], made with boiled [[yufka]]/[[phyllo]] layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. [[Cheburek|\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek]] (also known as ''Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi'') is fried and stuffed with minced meat. [[Kol b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is another well-known type of b\u00f6rek that takes its name from its shape, as do [[fincan]] (coffee cup), [[muska (pastry)|muska]] (talisman), [[G\u00fcl b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (rose) or [[Sigara b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (cigarette). Other traditional Turkish b\u00f6reks include [[Tala\u015f b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (phyllo dough filled with vegetables and diced meat), [[Puf b\u00f6re\u011fi]]. [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is a sweet type of b\u00f6rek, widespread in the [[Black Sea region]].\n\n[[Po\u011fa\u00e7a]] is the label name for dough based salty pastries. Likewise [[\u00e7\u00f6rek]] is another label name used for both sweet and salty pastries.\n\n[[G\u00f6zleme]] is a food typical in rural areas, made of [[lavash]] bread or phyllo dough folded around a variety of fillings such as spinach, cheese and parsley, minced meat or potatoes and cooked on a large griddle (traditionally [[sa\u010d]]).\n\n[[Katmer]] is another traditional rolled out dough. It can be salty or sweet according to the filling. Katmer with [[pistachio]] and [[kaymak]] is a sweet food and one of the most popular breakfast items in [[Gaziantep]].\n\n[[Lahmacun]] (meaning dough with meat in Arabic) is a thin flatbread covered with a layer of spiced minced meat, tomato, pepper, onion or garlic.\n\n[[Pita|Pide]], which can be made with minced meat (together with onion, chopped tomatoes, parsley and spices), [[kasseri|kashar]] cheese, spinach, white cheese, pieces of meat, braised meat ([[kavurma]]), sucuk, past\u0131rma or/and eggs put on rolled-out dough, is one of the most common traditional stone-baked Turkish specialities.\n\n[[A\u00e7ma]] is a soft bread found in most parts of Turkey.

It is typically served hot topped with garlic yogurt and melted butter or warmed olive oil, and a range of spices such as oregano, dried [[Mentha|mint]], ground [[sumac]], and [[Capsicum|red pepper]] powder. The combination of meat-filled dough with yogurt differentiates it from other dumplings such as tortellini, ravioli, and Chinese wonton. Mant\u0131 is usually eaten as a main dish. Minced chicken and quail meats are also used to prepare mant\u0131 in some regions of Turkey.\n|-\n|colspan=2|[[Kesme|Eri\u015fte]]\n|homemade pasta is called eri\u015fte in Turkey.

A large variety of vegetables are used, such as [[spinach]], [[leek]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[cabbage]], [[celery]], [[eggplant]], green and red [[bell pepper]]s, [[Green bean|string bean]] and [[jerusalem artichoke]]. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots saut\u00e9ed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or [[tomato paste]]. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish ''sulu yemek'' (literally \"a dish with juice\"). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil ''([[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131lar]])'' are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.\n\n[[Dolma]] is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (''biber dolmas\u0131''), eggplants, tomatoes, or [[zucchini]]/courgettes (''kabak dolmas\u0131''), vine leaves (''yaprak dolmas\u0131''). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or rice mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (''[[enginar dolmas\u0131]]'') is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, rice with spices or minced meat.\n\n[[Mercimek k\u00f6fte]], although being named k\u00f6fte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.\n\n[[Imam bayildi]] is a version of [[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]] with no minced meat inside. It can be served as a meze as well.\n\nFried eggplant and pepper is a common summer dish in Turkey. It is served with yogurt or tomato sauce and garlic.\n\n[[M\u00fccver]] is prepared with grated squash/courgette or potatoes, egg, onion, dill or cheese and flour. It can be either fried or cooked in the oven.\n\n[[Pilaf]] can be served either as a side dish or main dish but ''bulgur pilav\u0131'' (pilav made of boiled and pounded wheat - ''bulgur'') is also widely eaten. The dishes made with ''kuru fasulye'' ([[Common bean#White beans|white beans]]), ''nohut'' ([[chickpea]]s), ''mercimek'' ([[lentil]]s), ''b\u00f6r\u00fclce'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s), etc., combined with onion, vegetables, minced meat, tomato paste and rice, have always been common due to being economical and nutritious.\n\n[[Tur\u015fu]] is pickle made with brine, usually with the addition of garlic. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer. It is made with a large variety of vegetables, from cucumber to courgette. In the towns on the Aegean coast, the water of [[tur\u015fu]] is consumed as a drink. It comes from the Persian \"Torshi\", which refers to pickled \"Torsh\" (sour) vegetables.\n\n=== Egg dishes ===\n[[File:MenemenIstanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] (left) as part of a Turkish breakfast]]\n* [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] consists of scrambled eggs cooked in tomato, green pepper, and can be onion and garlic.\n* [[\u00c7\u0131lb\u0131r]] is another traditional Turkish food made with poached eggs, yogurt and oil.\n* ''Ispanakl\u0131 yumurta'' consists of eggs with spinach and onion.\n* Kaygana can be described as something of a cross between the pancake and the omelet in Ottoman cuisine. It used to be served with cheese, honey, crushed nuts, or eggplant. However, it is almost forgotten in the big cities of Turkey.\n\n=== Meze and salads ===\n[[File:Turkish Meze Plate.jpg|thumb|200px|A plate of Turkish meze]]\n[[Image:Cacik.jpg|thumb|200px|A bowl of [[Cac\u0131k]], the original form of seasoned, diluted [[yogurt]] with chopped cucumber, eaten throughout the former Ottoman world, under different names, like the [[tarator]] and [[tzatziki]] of the [[Balkans]].]]\n[[Image:Piyaz 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of piyaz]]\n[[Image:Kisir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of [[k\u0131s\u0131r]] decorated with green [[olive]] and [[cucumber]] pieces]]\n[[Image:Bira ve \u00e7oban salata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[\u00c7oban salatas\u0131]]]]\n\n[[Meze]] is a selection of food served as the appetizer course with or without drinks.

Dolma and sarma has a special place in Turkish cuisine. It can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. It can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, it is usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is only vegan recipe it should only have olive oil rice or bulgur and some nuts and raisins inside especially blackcurrant.\n\n[[Zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 yaprak sarmas\u0131]] (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as ''[[sarma (food)|sarma]]'', which means \"wrapping\" in Turkish. [[Dried fruit]] such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten ''zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 dolma'' in Ottoman cuisine. [[Vine leaves]] (''yaprak'') could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, ''[[etli yaprak sarma]]'', in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word ''sarma'' is also used for some types of desserts, such as [[f\u0131st\u0131k sarma]] (wrapped pistachio).\n\n[[Melon]] dolma along with [[quince]] or [[apple]] dolma was one of the palace's specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared. Although it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of dolma recipes, [[courgette]] (\"kabak\"), [[aubergine]] (\"patl\u0131can\"), [[tomato]] (\"domates\"), [[pumpkin]] (\"balkaba\u011f\u0131\"), [[Capsicum|pepper]] (\"biber\"), [[cabbage]] (\"lahana\") (black or white cabbage), [[chard]] (\"paz\u0131\") and [[mussel]] (\"midye\") dolma constitute the most common types. Instead of dried cherries in the palace cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil. A different type of dolma is [[mumbar]] dolmas\u0131, for which the membrane of intestines of sheep is filled up with a spicy rice-nut mixture.\n\n=== Meat dishes ===\n[[Image:Karn\u0131yar\u0131k.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Karn\u0131yar\u0131k]]]]\n[[Image:Kokore\u00e7.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Kokore\u00e7]] cooking on a spit]]\n[[Image:Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in Espoo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A plate of Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in [[Tapiola]], [[Espoo]], Finland.]]\n* Consisted of chicken or lean veal, D\u00f6ner kebap is a common Turkish fast food.\n* Tantuni (similar to ''d\u00fcr\u00fcm'', meat cut in very small pieces, served with lavash, a specialty from the [[Mersin]] province of Turkey)\n* Kuzu g\u00fcve\u00e7 (lamb cooked in earthenware casserole)\n* Past\u0131rmal\u0131 [[kuru fasulye]] (white kidney bean stew with [[past\u0131rma]])\n* [[Kuzu kapama]] (spring lamb stewed)\n* Ha\u015flama (boiled lamb with vegetables and lemon juice)\n* [[Kavurma]] which means frying, roasting or parching in Turkish, is generally used for roasted lamb or a variety of fried meat dishes. \u00c7oban kavurma is a variety of it, prepared with diced lamb with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers and herbs.

Fish are grilled, fried or cooked slowly by the ''bu\u011fulama'' (poaching) method. ''Bu\u011fulama'' is fish with lemon and parsley, covered while cooking so that it will be cooked with steam. The term ''pil\u00e2ki'' is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (\u00e7iroz), canned, salted or pickled (l\u00e2kerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey. Paz\u0131da Levrek is a seafood speciality which consists of [[European seabass|sea bass]] cooked in [[chard]] leaves. In fish restaurants, it is possible to find other fancy fish varieties like ''bal\u0131k dolma'' (stuffed fish), ''bal\u0131k iskender'' (inspired by [[\u0130skender kebap]]), fishballs or fish en papillote. [[Fish soup]] prepared with vegetables, onion and flour is common in coastal towns and cities. In [[Istanbul]]'s [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and other coastal districts, grilled fish served in bread with tomatoes, herbs and onion is a popular fast food. In the inner parts of Turkey, [[trout]] ''alabal\u0131k''  is common as it is the main type of freshwater fish. Popular seafood mezes at coastlines include stuffed mussels, fried [[mussel]] and fried ''kalamar'' ([[Squid (food)|squid]]) with [[tarator]] sauce.\n\nPopular sea fish in Turkey include:<ref>English names for fish from [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Penguin, 1972. {{ISBN|0-14-046174-4}}</ref> \n[[Image:Trachurus trachurus fish 7218 Nevit.JPG|thumb|Istavrit on display at a fish market]]\n* [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]] ''hamsi''\n* [[Sardine (food)|sardine]] ''sardalya''\n* [[bonito]] ''palamut''\n* [[gilt-head bream]] ''\u00e7upra'' or ''\u00e7ipura''\n* [[red mullet]] ''barbun(ya)''\n* [[sea bass]] ''levrek''\n* [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]] or ''bakalyaro''\n* [[haddock]] ''mezgit''\n* [[swordfish]] ''k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 bal\u0131g\u0131''\n* [[turbot]] ''kalkan''\n* [[Pagellus bellottii|red pandora]] ''mercan'' \n* [[Trachurus|Jack mackerel]] 'istavrit'\n* [[Epinephelus|white grouper]] ''lagos''\n* [[bluefish]] ''l\u00fcfer''\n\n=== Desserts ===\n{{see also|List of Turkish desserts}}\n[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|right|230px|[[Baklava]] is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes.]]\n[[Image:Firinda s\u00fctla\u00e7.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''S\u00fctla\u00e7'', or Turkish [[rice pudding]].]]\n[[File:T Honey.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Turkish delight]].]]\n[[File:Kazandibi.JPG|thumb|right|230px|\n[[Kazandibi]], means the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface.]]\n[[File:Wasserweltfest 2012 - T\u00fcrkische Mehlspeise.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[\u015eekerpare]].]]\nOne of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is [[baklava]]. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include [[\u015f\u00f6biyet]], [[b\u00fclb\u00fcl yuvas\u0131]], [[saray sarmas\u0131]], [[S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye|s\u00fctl\u00fc nuriye]], and [[sar\u0131 burma]].\n\n[[Kadaif]] ('Kaday\u0131f') is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of [[kadaif]]: tel (wire) or [[Burma (dessert)|Burma]] (wring) kaday\u0131f, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.\n\nAlthough carrying the label \"kaday\u0131f\", [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] is totally different from \"tel kaday\u0131f\". [[K\u00fcnefe]] and [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with [[kaymak]] (clotted/scrambled butter). K\u00fcnefe contains wire kaday\u0131f with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.\n\nAmong milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are [[muhallebi]], [[su muhallebisi]], [[s\u00fctla\u00e7]] (rice pudding), [[ke\u015fk\u00fcl]], [[kazandibi]] (meaning the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface), and [[tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc]] (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is [[haytal\u0131]], which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.\n\n[[Halva|Helva]] (halva): [[un helvas\u0131]] (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), [[irmik helvas\u0131]] (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), [[yaz helvas\u0131]] (made from walnut or almond<ref>Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131 - Sufi cuisine</ref>), [[tahin helvas\u0131]] (crushed sesame seeds), [[kos helva]], [[pi\u015fmaniye]] (floss halva).\n\nOther popular desserts include; [[Revani]] (with semolina and starch), [[\u015fekerpare]], [[kalburabasma]], [[dilber duda\u011f\u0131]], [[vezir parma\u011f\u0131]], [[han\u0131m g\u00f6be\u011fi]], [[Kemal Pasha dessert|kemalpa\u015fa]], [[tulumba]], [[zerde]], [[h\u00f6\u015fmerim]], [[paluze]], [[irmik tatl\u0131s\u0131/peltesi]], [[lokma]].\n\n[[G\u00fclla\u00e7]] is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with \"prayers\", as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.\n\n[[Ashure|A\u015fure]] can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on [[Noah's Ark]] and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking a\u015fure especially during the month of Muharrem.\n\nSome traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: ''ayva tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[quince]]), ''incir tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[Common fig|fig]]), ''kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''elma tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[apple]]) and ''armut tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pear]]). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and [[kaymak]].\n\nHomemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called [[kurabiye]] in Turkish. The most common types are [[ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi]] (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), [[un kurabiyesi]] (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is [[ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi]].\n\n[[Tahin-pekmez]] is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is [[tahini|sesame paste]] and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.\n\n[[Lokum]] ([[Turkish delight]]), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called \"rahat hulkum\" in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.\n\n[[Cezerye]], [[cevizli (walnut) sucuk]] (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as [[Churchkhela]] in Circassian region) and [[pestil]] (fruit pestils) are among other common sweets.\n\n[[Marzipan]] ''badem ezmesi'' or ''f\u0131st\u0131k ezmesi'' (made of ground pistachios) is another common confection in Turkey.\n\nAnother jelly like Turkish sweet is [[macun]]. [[Mesir macunu]] of [[Manisa]]/[[\u0130zmir]] (which was also called \"nevruziye\" as this macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that \"mesir macunu\" is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, [[nane macunu]] (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkap\u0131 under the control of the chief doctor \"hekimba\u015f\u0131\" and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of [[macun]] and [[Sharbat|sherbet]].<ref>Marianna Yerasimos, Ottoman cuisine</ref>\n\nThere are also several types of ice creams based on [[salep]] powder or [[Cornstarch]] with [[Rose water]] such as [[Dondurma]] (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.\n\nDried fruit, used in dolma, pilav, meat dishes and other desserts is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Figs, grapes, apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.\n\n''Kaymak'' (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.\n\n[[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee]], with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.\n\n=== Street food ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Mara\u015f dondurmas\u0131 in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Dondurma]]\n[[File:Macun in Turkey.jpg|thumb|Macun]]\n* [[Dondurma]]\n* fried mussels, stuffed mussels ''midye''\n* fresh walnuts ''taze ceviz''\n* g\u00f6zleme a very thin stuffed flat bred similar to [[paratha]], fillings can include any combination of spiced potato, feta, spinach and ground meat \n* kokore\u00e7\n* kumpir a baked potato served with ''ka\u015far'' cheese and many other toppings\n* [[lokma]]\n* roasted corn ''k\u00f6zde m\u0131s\u0131r''\n* roasted chesnuts ''kestane''\n* simit\n* [[Macun]]\n\n== Beverages ==\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey}}\n[[File:Turkish wine regions map.png|thumb|300px|Wine-producing regions in Turkey.]]\nAlthough the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are as widely available as anywhere. However, some Turks abstain from drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Rak\u0131]] (pronounced [\u027ea\u02c8k\u026f]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey. It is considered as the national alcoholic beverage of Turkey. There are a few local brands of [[lager]] such as Bomonti, Marmara34 and [[Efes Beverage Group|Efes Pilsen]] and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, [[Beck's]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg Brewery|Tuborg]].\n\nThere are a variety of local [[wine]]s produced by Turkish brands such as [[Sevilen group|Sevilen]], [[Kavakl\u0131dere (wine)|Kavakl\u0131dere]], Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, [[Pinot noir]], [[Adakaras\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Semillion]], [[Kuntra]], [[Gamay]], [[Cinsault]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Carignane]], [[\u00c7alkaras\u0131]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Alicante Bouschet]]; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, [[\u00d6k\u00fczg\u00f6z\u00fc]], [[Bo\u011fazkere]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Kalecik Karas\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]; in the Mediterranean Region, [[Sergi Karas\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Semillion]], [[Beylerce]], [[Yap\u0131ncak]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] and [[semillion]]; in the Black Sea Region, [[Narince (grape)|Narince]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Emir (grape)|Emir]], [[Hasandede]] (for further info http://www.hayyam.com/uzumler/index.php{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}). In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different \"home made\" wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/[[Cappadocia]] region - [[Nev\u015fehir]]), the Aegean coast ([[Sel\u00e7uk]] and [[Bozcaada]] (an island in the Aegean Sea)).\n\n=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===\n[[Image:Rize tea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Turkish tea]]]]\n[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Turkish coffee]]]]\nAt breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink [[black tea]] (''\u00e7ay''). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. [[Turkish coffee]] (''kahve'') is usually served after meals or with dessert.\n\n[[Ayran]] (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It's a mix of yogurt and water, similar to [[lassi]]. It may be served with salt, according to taste.\n\n[[\u015ealgam suyu]] (mild or spicy fermented red carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with [[rak\u0131]].\n\n[[Boza]] is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with [[leblebi]]).\n\n[[Sahlep]] is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.\n\n''Limonata'' (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called ''\u00e7\u0131lekl\u0131 l\u0131monata''.\n\n[[Sherbet (Middle Eastern drink)|Sherbet]] (Turkish ''\u015ferbet,'' pronounced {{IPA-tr|\u0283e\u027e\u02c8bet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, [[cornelian cherry]], pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices.

The cooking of [[Istanbul]], [[Bursa]], [[Izmir]], and rest of the [[Asia Minor]] region inherits many elements of [[Ottoman court]] [[cuisine]], with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over [[bulgur]], [[kofte]]s and a wider availability of vegetable stews (''t\u00fcrl\u00fc''), [[eggplant]], stuffed [[dolma]]s and fish. The cuisine of the [[Black Sea Region]] uses fish extensively, especially the [[European anchovy|Black Sea anchovy]] (''hamsi'') and includes [[maize]] dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. [[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]], and [[Adana]]) is famous for its variety of [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''[[\u015f\u00f6biyet]]'', ''[[Kanafeh|kaday\u0131f]]'', and ''[[k\u00fcnefe]]''.\n\nEspecially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref name=\"multiple\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |title=Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones |access-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429005226/http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. [[Central Anatolia]] has many famous specialties, such as ''[[ke\u015fkek]]'', ''[[mant\u0131]]'' (especially from [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[g\u00f6zleme]]''. Food names directly cognate with ''mant\u0131'' are found also in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (''[[mantou]]'' or steamed bun) and [[Korean cuisine]] (''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'').\n\nA specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between ''Urfa kebap'' and ''[[Adana kebap]]'' is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. ''Urfa kebap'' is less spicy and thicker than ''Adana kebap''. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are the mainstay in Turkish cuisine as presented in foreign countries, native Turkish meals largely center around [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[bread]].\n\n== Culinary customs ==\n\n=== Breakfast ===\n[[File:Simit-2x.JPG|thumb|right|[[Simit]], a circular bread with sesame seeds, is a common breakfast item in Turkey.]]\n\nTurks usually prefer a rich breakfast. A typical Turkish [[breakfast]] consists of cheese (''[[beyaz peynir]]'', ''[[ka\u015far]]'' etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and [[kaymak]], [[Sujuk|sucuk]] (a spicy Turkish sausage, can be eaten with eggs), ''[[past\u0131rma]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'', ''[[simit]]'', ''[[po\u011fa\u00e7a]]'' and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called [[Menemen (food)|menemen]], which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion,  olive oil and eggs. Invariably, [[Turkish tea]] is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, ''kahvalt\u0131'', means \"before coffee\" (''kahve'', 'coffee'; ''alt\u0131'', 'under').\n\n=== Homemade food ===\nHomemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out; Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or [[Mincing|minced]] meat), often with or before rice or [[bulgur]] [[pilav]] accompanied by a salad or [[cac\u0131k]] (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (''[[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131]] yemekler'') instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n[[File:Akcaabatkofte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ak\u00e7aabat meatballs]].]]\nAlthough fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey, Turkish people still rely primarily on the rich and extensive dishes of Turkish cuisine. In addition, some traditional Turkish foods, especially ''[[Kofta|k\u00f6fte]]'', ''[[Doner kebab|d\u00f6ner]]'', ''[[kokore\u00e7]]'', ''[[kumpir]]'' ''midye tava'' ''b\u00f6rek'' and ''g\u00f6zleme'', are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whiting | first=Dominic |year=2000 |title=Turkey Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Cz4zG73sHgC&pg=PA56&dq=lokanta |publisher=Footprint Handbooks |page=56 |isbn=978-1-900949-85-9 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> ''Esnaf lokantas\u0131'' (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.\n\n=== Summer cuisine ===\nIn the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as eggplant (aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] and [[\u00e7\u0131lb\u0131r]] are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer ''summer helva'', which is lighter and less sweet than the regular one.\n\n=== Key ingredients ===\nFrequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include: lamb, beef, rice, fish, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper|green peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[zucchini]]s and [[tomato]]es. Nuts, especially [[pistachio]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[walnut]]s, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. [[Semolina]] flour is used to make a cake called [[Basbousa|''revani'']] and [[Halva|''irmik helvasi'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+Commonly used spices and flavorings:\n!Name\n!Turkish\n!Used in\n!References\n|-\n|[[Allspice]]\n|''Yenibahar'' or ''Dolma bahar''\n|[[Dolma]], vegetables, rice, fish\n|<ref name=akin>{{Cite book| publisher = Abrams| isbn = 978-1-61312-871-8| last = Akin| first = Engin| title = Essential Turkish Cuisine| date = 2015-10-06}}</ref><ref name=basan>{{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-15617-6| last = Basan| first = Ghillie| title = Classic Turkish Cooking| date = 1997-04-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Anise]]\n|''Anason''\n|[[Peksimet]], [[rak\u0131]], used to season nut and dried fruit mixtures in both sweet and savory dishes\n|<ref name=akin /><ref name=basan />\n|-\n|[[Black pepper]]\n|''Kara biber''\n|egg dishes, meat dishes, [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]]\n|<ref name=akin />\n|-\n|[[Cardamom]]\n|''Kakule''\n|Rarely used, mostly in coffee.

[[Beyaz peynir]] and [[yogurt]] are part of many dishes including [[b\u00f6rek]], [[manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[kebab]] and [[Tzatziki|cacik]].\n\n=== Oils and fats ===\n[[Butter]] or [[margarine]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[canola oil]], and [[corn oil]] are widely used for cooking. [[Sesame]], [[hazelnut]], [[peanut]] and [[walnut]] oils are used as well. ''Kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131'' ([[tail fat]] of [[sheep]]) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe rich and diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. [[Plum]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s, along with many kinds of [[citrus]] are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, ''[[compote|komposto]]'' (compote) or ''[[ho\u015faf]]'' (from Persian ''khosh \u00e2b'', literally meaning \"nice water\") are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. ''[[Dolma]]'' and pilaf usually contain currants or raisins. ''Etli yaprak sarma'' (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.\n\n[[Image:\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131 with b\u00f6rek.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131]] with Borek]]\nEggplant ({{lang-tr|patl\u0131can}}) has a special place in the Turkish cuisine.\n\n=== Meats ===\n\nIn some regions, meat, which was mostly eaten only at wedding ceremonies or during the ''Kurban Bayram\u0131'' (''[[Eid ul-Adha]]'') as ''etli pilav'' ([[pilaf]] with meat), has become part of the daily diet since the introduction of industrial production. [[Veal]], formerly shunned, is now widely consumed.\n\nThe main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and [[vegetable]], with names such as ''[[k\u0131ymal\u0131]] fasulye'' (beans with ground meat) or ''k\u0131ymal\u0131 \u0131spanak'' (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with [[yogurt]]).\n\nAlternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as ''sardalya'' (sardines) or ''hamsi'' (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed [[Domestic sheep|lambs]], once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. ''Kuzu \u00e7evirme'', cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.\n\n== Dishes and foods ==\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n[[File:Fresh ayran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Fresh Ayran with a head of foam]]\n\n[[Yogurt]] is an important element in Turkish cuisine.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word ''yo\u011furt''. Yogurt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, k\u00f6fte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat etc.), ''meze'' and a specialty called ''mant\u0131'' (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yogurt is regularly eaten with rice or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, ''s\u00fczme yo\u011furt'' or \"strained yogurt\", is made by straining the yogurt curds from the [[whey]]. One of the most common Turkish drinks, ''[[ayran]]'', is made from yogurt. Also, yogurt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries.\n\n==== Cheeses ====\n[[File:Kaschkawal Kashkaval \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b Balkank\u00e4se Sofia IMG 7650.JPG|thumb|''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' cheese]]\n[[File:Otlu tulum peyniri.jpg|thumb|Varieties of ''[[Tulum cheese|tulum]]'': center \"Otlu tulum peyniri\", or Tulum with herbs, in [[Ankara]]]]\n\nTurkey produces many varieties of [[cheese]], mostly from [[domestic sheep|sheep]]'s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. By the tent\n\n* ''[[Beyaz peynir]]'' is a salty [[brined cheese]] taking its name from its white color (\"white cheese\"). It is similar to ''[[feta]]'' but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region ([[Ezine, \u00c7anakkale|Ezine]] or [[Turkish Thrace|Thrace]]) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as ''[[Menemen (food)|menemen]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'' and ''[[Pita|pide]]''.\n* ''[[\u00c7erkez peyniri]]'', means \"[[Circassians|Circassian]] cheese\". It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.\n* ''[[\u00c7\u00f6kelek]]'' is dried [[cottage cheese]]. There are many regional varieties of ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek''. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun. \n* ''[[Kurut]]'' and ''ke\u015f'' are regional names for dried bricks of yogurt made from low-fat milk or from ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek'' made from buttermilk.<ref name=KCheese>{{Cite web| url=http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115070211/http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2013| title=Turkish Cheeses| accessdate=2007-12-07| date=2 June 2005}}</ref>\n* ''[[Kars gravyer cheese|Gravyer]]'' is produced in Turkey as well. Among others, [[Kars]] is famous for this type of cheese.\n* ''[[Hellim]]'' is a salty, firm-textured goat cheese, generally with some mint added, made in [[Northern Cyprus]]. In Turkey, it is common to fry ''hellim'' in a pan in some olive oil.\n* ''[[Ka\u015far]]'' is Turkey's other ubiquitous cheese, a moderately fatty sheep's cheese similar to the Greek ''[[kasseri]]'', sometimes marketed as \"Turkish cheddar\", being closer in consistency and taste to mild [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar-style cheese]] than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured ''ka\u015far'', called fresh ''ka\u015far'', is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular [[Kars]] and Thrace.\n* ''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep's cheese, similar to fresh ''ka\u015far''. The name comes from Romanian word ''ca\u0219caval'', which bears the Italian structure of ''caciocavallo''. \n* ''[[Lor (food)|Lor]]'' is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from ''ka\u015far'' or ''strained yogurt'' manufacture. ''Lor'' is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like \"ek\u015fimik\" and ''h\u00f6\u015fmerim''\n* ''[[Mihali\u00e7 Peyniri|Mihali\u00e7 peyniri]]'' or ''Kelle peyniri'' is a hard sheep's cheese that can be grated, like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihali\u00e7 during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pastorized milk and processed by salt.\n* ''[[Braided cheese|\u00d6rg\u00fc peyniri]]'', \"[[braided cheese]]\", is a specialty from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].\n* ''[[Van herbed cheese|Otlu peynir]]''[[Van herbed cheese]] (\"herbed cheese\") is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep's or goat's milk is used, but more recently cow's milk ''otlu peynir'' has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van [[Ramsons|wild garlic]] is traditional; Bitlis ''otlu peynir'' contains a damp-loving herb known as ''sof otu''. In other areas horse mint (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and ''[[Pimpinella rhodentha]]'' are used.<ref name=KCheese/>\n* ''[[Tulum (cheese)|Tulum]]'' is a mostly sheep's curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum.

Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being; mercimek ([[lentil]]) \u00e7orbas\u0131, yogurt, or [[wheat]] (often mashed) called [[tarhana]] \u00e7orbas\u0131. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as [[\u0130\u015fkembe soup]] and [[pa\u00e7a]] \u00e7orbas\u0131, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal.

[[Su b\u00f6re\u011fi]], made with boiled [[yufka]]/[[phyllo]] layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. [[Cheburek|\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek]] (also known as ''Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi'') is fried and stuffed with minced meat.

The combination of meat-filled dough with yogurt differentiates it from other dumplings such as tortellini, ravioli, and Chinese wonton. Mant\u0131 is usually eaten as a main dish.

A large variety of vegetables are used, such as [[spinach]], [[leek]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[cabbage]], [[celery]], [[eggplant]], green and red [[bell pepper]]s, [[Green bean|string bean]] and [[jerusalem artichoke]]. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots saut\u00e9ed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or [[tomato paste]]. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish ''sulu yemek'' (literally \"a dish with juice\"). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil ''([[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131lar]])'' are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.\n\n[[Dolma]] is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (''biber dolmas\u0131''), eggplants, tomatoes, or [[zucchini]]/courgettes (''kabak dolmas\u0131''), vine leaves (''yaprak dolmas\u0131''). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or rice mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (''[[enginar dolmas\u0131]]'') is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, rice with spices or minced meat.\n\n[[Mercimek k\u00f6fte]], although being named k\u00f6fte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.\n\n[[Imam bayildi]] is a version of [[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]] with no minced meat inside. It can be served as a meze as well.\n\nFried eggplant and pepper is a common summer dish in Turkey. It is served with yogurt or tomato sauce and garlic.\n\n[[M\u00fccver]] is prepared with grated squash/courgette or potatoes, egg, onion, dill or cheese and flour. It can be either fried or cooked in the oven.\n\n[[Pilaf]] can be served either as a side dish or main dish but ''bulgur pilav\u0131'' (pilav made of boiled and pounded wheat - ''bulgur'') is also widely eaten. The dishes made with ''kuru fasulye'' ([[Common bean#White beans|white beans]]), ''nohut'' ([[chickpea]]s), ''mercimek'' ([[lentil]]s), ''b\u00f6r\u00fclce'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s), etc., combined with onion, vegetables, minced meat, tomato paste and rice, have always been common due to being economical and nutritious.\n\n[[Tur\u015fu]] is pickle made with brine, usually with the addition of garlic. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer. It is made with a large variety of vegetables, from cucumber to courgette. In the towns on the Aegean coast, the water of [[tur\u015fu]] is consumed as a drink. It comes from the Persian \"Torshi\", which refers to pickled \"Torsh\" (sour) vegetables.\n\n=== Egg dishes ===\n[[File:MenemenIstanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] (left) as part of a Turkish breakfast]]\n* [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] consists of scrambled eggs cooked in tomato, green pepper, and can be onion and garlic.\n* [[\u00c7\u0131lb\u0131r]] is another traditional Turkish food made with poached eggs, yogurt and oil.\n* ''Ispanakl\u0131 yumurta'' consists of eggs with spinach and onion.\n* Kaygana can be described as something of a cross between the pancake and the omelet in Ottoman cuisine. It used to be served with cheese, honey, crushed nuts, or eggplant. However, it is almost forgotten in the big cities of Turkey.\n\n=== Meze and salads ===\n[[File:Turkish Meze Plate.jpg|thumb|200px|A plate of Turkish meze]]\n[[Image:Cacik.jpg|thumb|200px|A bowl of [[Cac\u0131k]], the original form of seasoned, diluted [[yogurt]] with chopped cucumber, eaten throughout the former Ottoman world, under different names, like the [[tarator]] and [[tzatziki]] of the [[Balkans]].]]\n[[Image:Piyaz 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of piyaz]]\n[[Image:Kisir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of [[k\u0131s\u0131r]] decorated with green [[olive]] and [[cucumber]] pieces]]\n[[Image:Bira ve \u00e7oban salata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[\u00c7oban salatas\u0131]]]]\n\n[[Meze]] is a selection of food served as the appetizer course with or without drinks.

Dolma and sarma has a special place in Turkish cuisine. It can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. It can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, it is usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is only vegan recipe it should only have olive oil rice or bulgur and some nuts and raisins inside especially blackcurrant.\n\n[[Zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 yaprak sarmas\u0131]] (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as ''[[sarma (food)|sarma]]'', which means \"wrapping\" in Turkish. [[Dried fruit]] such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten ''zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 dolma'' in Ottoman cuisine. [[Vine leaves]] (''yaprak'') could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, ''[[etli yaprak sarma]]'', in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word ''sarma'' is also used for some types of desserts, such as [[f\u0131st\u0131k sarma]] (wrapped pistachio).\n\n[[Melon]] dolma along with [[quince]] or [[apple]] dolma was one of the palace's specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared. Although it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of dolma recipes, [[courgette]] (\"kabak\"), [[aubergine]] (\"patl\u0131can\"), [[tomato]] (\"domates\"), [[pumpkin]] (\"balkaba\u011f\u0131\"), [[Capsicum|pepper]] (\"biber\"), [[cabbage]] (\"lahana\") (black or white cabbage), [[chard]] (\"paz\u0131\") and [[mussel]] (\"midye\") dolma constitute the most common types. Instead of dried cherries in the palace cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil. A different type of dolma is [[mumbar]] dolmas\u0131, for which the membrane of intestines of sheep is filled up with a spicy rice-nut mixture.\n\n=== Meat dishes ===\n[[Image:Karn\u0131yar\u0131k.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Karn\u0131yar\u0131k]]]]\n[[Image:Kokore\u00e7.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Kokore\u00e7]] cooking on a spit]]\n[[Image:Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in Espoo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A plate of Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in [[Tapiola]], [[Espoo]], Finland.]]\n* Consisted of chicken or lean veal, D\u00f6ner kebap is a common Turkish fast food.\n* Tantuni (similar to ''d\u00fcr\u00fcm'', meat cut in very small pieces, served with lavash, a specialty from the [[Mersin]] province of Turkey)\n* Kuzu g\u00fcve\u00e7 (lamb cooked in earthenware casserole)\n* Past\u0131rmal\u0131 [[kuru fasulye]] (white kidney bean stew with [[past\u0131rma]])\n* [[Kuzu kapama]] (spring lamb stewed)\n* Ha\u015flama (boiled lamb with vegetables and lemon juice)\n* [[Kavurma]] which means frying, roasting or parching in Turkish, is generally used for roasted lamb or a variety of fried meat dishes. \u00c7oban kavurma is a variety of it, prepared with diced lamb with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers and herbs.

[[Kad\u0131nbudu k\u00f6fte]] is another traditional speciality; minced meat is mixed with cooked rice and fried. [[I\u00e7li k\u00f6fte]] can be described as a shell of \"bulgur\" filled with onion, minced meat and nuts. [[\u00c7i\u011f k\u00f6fte]] is a meze from south-eastern Turkey meaning raw meatballs, prepared with \"bulgur\" and raw minced meat.

Instead of classical sausages (''sosis''), sucuk is the most used ingredient for snacks and fast-food style toasts and sandwiches in Turkey.\n* [[Past\u0131rma]] is another famous beef delicacy. Both past\u0131rma and sucuk can be put in [[kuru fasulye]] (dry beans) to enrich the aroma. Both can be served as a meze as well.

Fish are grilled, fried or cooked slowly by the ''bu\u011fulama'' (poaching) method. ''Bu\u011fulama'' is fish with lemon and parsley, covered while cooking so that it will be cooked with steam. The term ''pil\u00e2ki'' is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (\u00e7iroz), canned, salted or pickled (l\u00e2kerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey. Paz\u0131da Levrek is a seafood speciality which consists of [[European seabass|sea bass]] cooked in [[chard]] leaves. In fish restaurants, it is possible to find other fancy fish varieties like ''bal\u0131k dolma'' (stuffed fish), ''bal\u0131k iskender'' (inspired by [[\u0130skender kebap]]), fishballs or fish en papillote. [[Fish soup]] prepared with vegetables, onion and flour is common in coastal towns and cities. In [[Istanbul]]'s [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and other coastal districts, grilled fish served in bread with tomatoes, herbs and onion is a popular fast food. In the inner parts of Turkey, [[trout]] ''alabal\u0131k''  is common as it is the main type of freshwater fish. Popular seafood mezes at coastlines include stuffed mussels, fried [[mussel]] and fried ''kalamar'' ([[Squid (food)|squid]]) with [[tarator]] sauce.\n\nPopular sea fish in Turkey include:<ref>English names for fish from [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Penguin, 1972. {{ISBN|0-14-046174-4}}</ref> \n[[Image:Trachurus trachurus fish 7218 Nevit.JPG|thumb|Istavrit on display at a fish market]]\n* [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]] ''hamsi''\n* [[Sardine (food)|sardine]] ''sardalya''\n* [[bonito]] ''palamut''\n* [[gilt-head bream]] ''\u00e7upra'' or ''\u00e7ipura''\n* [[red mullet]] ''barbun(ya)''\n* [[sea bass]] ''levrek''\n* [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]] or ''bakalyaro''\n* [[haddock]] ''mezgit''\n* [[swordfish]] ''k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 bal\u0131g\u0131''\n* [[turbot]] ''kalkan''\n* [[Pagellus bellottii|red pandora]] ''mercan'' \n* [[Trachurus|Jack mackerel]] 'istavrit'\n* [[Epinephelus|white grouper]] ''lagos''\n* [[bluefish]] ''l\u00fcfer''\n\n=== Desserts ===\n{{see also|List of Turkish desserts}}\n[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|right|230px|[[Baklava]] is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes.]]\n[[Image:Firinda s\u00fctla\u00e7.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''S\u00fctla\u00e7'', or Turkish [[rice pudding]].]]\n[[File:T Honey.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Turkish delight]].]]\n[[File:Kazandibi.JPG|thumb|right|230px|\n[[Kazandibi]], means the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface.]]\n[[File:Wasserweltfest 2012 - T\u00fcrkische Mehlspeise.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[\u015eekerpare]].]]\nOne of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is [[baklava]]. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include [[\u015f\u00f6biyet]], [[b\u00fclb\u00fcl yuvas\u0131]], [[saray sarmas\u0131]], [[S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye|s\u00fctl\u00fc nuriye]], and [[sar\u0131 burma]].\n\n[[Kadaif]] ('Kaday\u0131f') is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of [[kadaif]]: tel (wire) or [[Burma (dessert)|Burma]] (wring) kaday\u0131f, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.\n\nAlthough carrying the label \"kaday\u0131f\", [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] is totally different from \"tel kaday\u0131f\". [[K\u00fcnefe]] and [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with [[kaymak]] (clotted/scrambled butter). K\u00fcnefe contains wire kaday\u0131f with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.\n\nAmong milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are [[muhallebi]], [[su muhallebisi]], [[s\u00fctla\u00e7]] (rice pudding), [[ke\u015fk\u00fcl]], [[kazandibi]] (meaning the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface), and [[tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc]] (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is [[haytal\u0131]], which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.\n\n[[Halva|Helva]] (halva): [[un helvas\u0131]] (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), [[irmik helvas\u0131]] (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), [[yaz helvas\u0131]] (made from walnut or almond<ref>Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131 - Sufi cuisine</ref>), [[tahin helvas\u0131]] (crushed sesame seeds), [[kos helva]], [[pi\u015fmaniye]] (floss halva).\n\nOther popular desserts include; [[Revani]] (with semolina and starch), [[\u015fekerpare]], [[kalburabasma]], [[dilber duda\u011f\u0131]], [[vezir parma\u011f\u0131]], [[han\u0131m g\u00f6be\u011fi]], [[Kemal Pasha dessert|kemalpa\u015fa]], [[tulumba]], [[zerde]], [[h\u00f6\u015fmerim]], [[paluze]], [[irmik tatl\u0131s\u0131/peltesi]], [[lokma]].\n\n[[G\u00fclla\u00e7]] is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with \"prayers\", as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.\n\n[[Ashure|A\u015fure]] can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on [[Noah's Ark]] and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking a\u015fure especially during the month of Muharrem.\n\nSome traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: ''ayva tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[quince]]), ''incir tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[Common fig|fig]]), ''kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''elma tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[apple]]) and ''armut tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pear]]). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and [[kaymak]].\n\nHomemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called [[kurabiye]] in Turkish. The most common types are [[ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi]] (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), [[un kurabiyesi]] (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is [[ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi]].\n\n[[Tahin-pekmez]] is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is [[tahini|sesame paste]] and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.\n\n[[Lokum]] ([[Turkish delight]]), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called \"rahat hulkum\" in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.\n\n[[Cezerye]], [[cevizli (walnut) sucuk]] (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as [[Churchkhela]] in Circassian region) and [[pestil]] (fruit pestils) are among other common sweets.\n\n[[Marzipan]] ''badem ezmesi'' or ''f\u0131st\u0131k ezmesi'' (made of ground pistachios) is another common confection in Turkey.\n\nAnother jelly like Turkish sweet is [[macun]]. [[Mesir macunu]] of [[Manisa]]/[[\u0130zmir]] (which was also called \"nevruziye\" as this macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that \"mesir macunu\" is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, [[nane macunu]] (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkap\u0131 under the control of the chief doctor \"hekimba\u015f\u0131\" and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of [[macun]] and [[Sharbat|sherbet]].<ref>Marianna Yerasimos, Ottoman cuisine</ref>\n\nThere are also several types of ice creams based on [[salep]] powder or [[Cornstarch]] with [[Rose water]] such as [[Dondurma]] (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.\n\nDried fruit, used in dolma, pilav, meat dishes and other desserts is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Figs, grapes, apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.\n\n''Kaymak'' (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.\n\n[[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee]], with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.\n\n=== Street food ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Mara\u015f dondurmas\u0131 in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Dondurma]]\n[[File:Macun in Turkey.jpg|thumb|Macun]]\n* [[Dondurma]]\n* fried mussels, stuffed mussels ''midye''\n* fresh walnuts ''taze ceviz''\n* g\u00f6zleme a very thin stuffed flat bred similar to [[paratha]], fillings can include any combination of spiced potato, feta, spinach and ground meat \n* kokore\u00e7\n* kumpir a baked potato served with ''ka\u015far'' cheese and many other toppings\n* [[lokma]]\n* roasted corn ''k\u00f6zde m\u0131s\u0131r''\n* roasted chesnuts ''kestane''\n* simit\n* [[Macun]]\n\n== Beverages ==\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey}}\n[[File:Turkish wine regions map.png|thumb|300px|Wine-producing regions in Turkey.]]\nAlthough the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are as widely available as anywhere. However, some Turks abstain from drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Rak\u0131]] (pronounced [\u027ea\u02c8k\u026f]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey. It is considered as the national alcoholic beverage of Turkey. There are a few local brands of [[lager]] such as Bomonti, Marmara34 and [[Efes Beverage Group|Efes Pilsen]] and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, [[Beck's]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg Brewery|Tuborg]].\n\nThere are a variety of local [[wine]]s produced by Turkish brands such as [[Sevilen group|Sevilen]], [[Kavakl\u0131dere (wine)|Kavakl\u0131dere]], Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, [[Pinot noir]], [[Adakaras\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Semillion]], [[Kuntra]], [[Gamay]], [[Cinsault]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Carignane]], [[\u00c7alkaras\u0131]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Alicante Bouschet]]; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, [[\u00d6k\u00fczg\u00f6z\u00fc]], [[Bo\u011fazkere]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Kalecik Karas\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]; in the Mediterranean Region, [[Sergi Karas\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Semillion]], [[Beylerce]], [[Yap\u0131ncak]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] and [[semillion]]; in the Black Sea Region, [[Narince (grape)|Narince]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Emir (grape)|Emir]], [[Hasandede]] (for further info http://www.hayyam.com/uzumler/index.php{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}). In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different \"home made\" wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/[[Cappadocia]] region - [[Nev\u015fehir]]), the Aegean coast ([[Sel\u00e7uk]] and [[Bozcaada]] (an island in the Aegean Sea)).\n\n=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===\n[[Image:Rize tea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Turkish tea]]]]\n[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Turkish coffee]]]]\nAt breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink [[black tea]] (''\u00e7ay''). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. [[Turkish coffee]] (''kahve'') is usually served after meals or with dessert.\n\n[[Ayran]] (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It's a mix of yogurt and water, similar to [[lassi]]. It may be served with salt, according to taste.\n\n[[\u015ealgam suyu]] (mild or spicy fermented red carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with [[rak\u0131]].\n\n[[Boza]] is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with [[leblebi]]).\n\n[[Sahlep]] is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.\n\n''Limonata'' (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called ''\u00e7\u0131lekl\u0131 l\u0131monata''.\n\n[[Sherbet (Middle Eastern drink)|Sherbet]] (Turkish ''\u015ferbet,'' pronounced {{IPA-tr|\u0283e\u027e\u02c8bet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, [[cornelian cherry]], pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices.  Sherbet is drunk diluted with cold water.\n\nIn classical Turkish cuisine, [[ho\u015faf]] (from the Persian \"Khosh-ab\", meaning \"fresh water\") alternatively accompanies meat dishes and ''pilav'' ([[pilaf]]).\n\n=== Related cuisines ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Greek cuisine]]\n* [[Albanian cuisine]]\n* [[Balkan cuisine]]\n* [[Central Asian cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]\n* [[Mongolian cuisine]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Caucasian cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food|Turkey}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baklava]]\n* [[Doner kebap]]\n* [[\u0130skender kebap]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* [[Kadaif]]\n* [[Kumpir]]\n* [[Mangal (barbecue)|Mangal]]\n* [[Manti (dumpling)|Mant\u0131]]\n* [[Meze]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]]\n* [[Turkish coffee]]\n* [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|Turkish rak\u0131]]\n* [[Turkish tea]]\n* [[List of stuffed dishes#Turkish stuffed dishes|Turkish stuffed dishes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Budak, S\u00fcheyl, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184656/http://www.nadirkitap.com/antakya-mutfagi-suheyl-budak-kitap3618320.html ''Antakya Mutfa\u011f\u0131''], Hatay 2008, {{oclc|705454123}} (1996 edition)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145106/http://blog.kitchenguerilla.com/2011/03/antakya-cuisine-with-suheyl-budak-and-75-ladies/?lang=en Antakya-cuisine with S\u00fcheyl Budak and 75 ladies]\n* G\u00fcrsoy, Deniz, ''Turkish Cuisine in Historical Perspective'', Istanbul, 2006, {{ISBN|975-329-564-2}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Konya Yemek K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc ve Konya Yemekleri'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-6021-16-0}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Sufi Cuisine'', Saqi 2005.\n* Lambraki, Mirsini & Ak\u0131n, Engin, ''Ayn\u0131 Sofrada \u0130ki \u00dclke, T\u00fcrk ve Yunan Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-458-484-2}}.\n* [[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''A New Book of Middle Eastern Food'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-046588-X}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Halk Mutfa\u011f\u0131m\u0131z Geleneksel Tatlar\u0131m\u0131zdan Se\u00e7meler'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-98180-2-7}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Turkish Cuisine'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-285-114-2}}\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & S\u00fct, Uyuyunca, ''T\u00fcrkiye Peynirleri'', Istanbul, {{ISBN|975-363-755-1}}.\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & Silivrim, Kaymak, ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin Yo\u011furtlar\u0131'', Istanbul 2007, {{ISBN|978-975-08-1276-7}}.\n* Yerasimos, Marianna, ''Osmanl\u0131 Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2002; published in English as ''500 Years of Ottoman Cuisine''.\n* Zubaida, Sami & Tapper, Richard, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London and New York, 1994 and 2000, {{ISBN|1-86064-603-4}}.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{cookbook}}\n{{Cookbook|Turkish Cooking}}\n* Turkish Cultural Foundation - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090301190825/http://www.turkish-cuisine.org/english/index.php Turkish Cuisine Portal]\n* [[Cornucopia (magazine)|Cornucopia]] recipe index - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090412033714/http://www.cornucopia.net/cookerylisting.html Cookery Listing]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131224173614/http://www.studyinturkey.org/en/discover-turkey/experience-turkey/turkish-cousine/ \"Turkish Cousine\" (Study In Turkey)]\n\n{{Turkey topics}}\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{European topic|| cuisine}}\n{{Mediterranean cuisine}}\n{{Middle Eastern cuisine}}\n{{cuisines}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turkish Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Turkish cuisine| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ail Subway", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCheeses", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine"}
