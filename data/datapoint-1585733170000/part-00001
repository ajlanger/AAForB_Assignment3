Indeed, the [[Coleman Report]] claimed this to be true in 1966, and subsequent studies have reported this research.<ref name=\"Goldhaber\" />  Excellent teaching can result in more than one year's growth of education, while poor quality teaching can result in loss of years of learning.  Given the strength of these findings, it is not surprising that NCLB chose to focus on improving teacher quality.  Indeed, the 2001 act included statues that required for 100% of core subject classes be taught by highly qualified teachers by the close of the 2005\u20132006 academic year.  It required states to create and to publish their plans for achieving this goal.  It also required for states to track their progress towards this goal, and to publish the progress every year.\n\n==State failures to meet performance criteria==\nStates did not hit the 100% highly qualified mark by the end of the 2006 academic year.  However, by end of the 2009\u20132010 academic year, the Department of Education reported that 98% of elementary core classes were taught by HQTs and 96% of secondary core classes were taught by HQTs.  41 of 50 states reported an increase in the overall percentage of HQTs from the 2003\u20132004 academic year to the 2009\u20132010 academic year.  Furthermore, 13 states reported 99% of core classes were taught by HQTs.

States are allowed the liberty to determine how teachers can prove their content knowledge.  Many states have chosen to approach this issue with standardized content exams.  However, the exams, themselves, are not standardized.  This means that \"qualification\" has a different meaning in each state.
