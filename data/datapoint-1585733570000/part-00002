The word ''''Sood'''' finds a mention in the Vedas at 23 places (15 places in the Rig Ved, 6 places in the Yajur Ved and twice in the Atharva Ved). Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Madhusudan' \u2013 (Sudan means 'sanharak' \u2013 killer of demon Madhu). The Sood community is a very ancient fraternity and some Sood/Sud gotras are merchants as well. \n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Brahmin Rishis were perturbed by the spread of Buddhism across India, because the old Vedic Hindu Dharma was getting a great set back. Hence, the Rishis performed a sacred Yajna at Mount Abu to revive old Hindu Dharma based on the Vedic traditions. The sacred flames of this Agni Kund, incarnated and baptised four Kshatriyas namely \u2013 the Parmar, the Parihar, the Solanki and the Chouhan. These four took a holy vow to re-establish the ancient glory of Hindu Dharma by fighting against the mass change of faith from Hinduism to Buddhism. These four Kshatriyas spread four new branches of Hinduism all over the country. The second son born to Parmar was named Sood and his descendents formed the Sood community. A reference of 44 descendants of Parmar is also available. These sood descendents formed the Sood Dynasty and the capital city of the Sood Dynasty for eight generations was Patten in Sind, now in Pakistan. The capital was later shifted to Alwar and finally King Jai Singh, (son of King Dahar) shifted his capital to Amar Kot, now in Pakistan. There is a reference of 101 Sood Kings or Rajas ruling in different parts of India. The Soods established themselves in the North and later got concentrated at Soodpur, now renamed Sirhind.  \n\nDue to the seven invasions of India by Ahmed Shah Abdali between 1748 and 1757 A.D., at Soodpur and gradually into Rajasthan and later of entire India, the Soods fled to different villages and towns in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.<ref name=\"originHistory\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#2|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Gotras or Sub Castes==\nBoth the Punjab section and the Hill section of the Sood community have 52 Gotras or Sub Castes each, many of which are named after the villages they settled in. <ref name=\"Gotras or Sub Castes\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#8|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Punjab section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Badhoo, Balgan, Baranwal, Behal, Beri, Bharak, Bhokaha (or Bhokhi), Bhola, Bodhi, Bourie, Brahmi, Dadan, Dauli (or Deli), Dhalli (or Dhati), Dhanda, Dhaunchak, Dhiri, Dhookhi, Dhoop, Dosaj, Gajri, Gajja (or Gajjey), Gondal (Gandel), Gopal, Goyal, Jandpal (or Janpal), Jari, Kajla (or Kajley), Lau, Mahidhar, Mahiyar (or Mayor), Makaura (or Makaurey), Mandal, Mohindra, Mohni, Mukandi, Momman, Nandoo, Nehra, Paal, Phakka, Pharwaha, Phassi, Poora, Rora, Rohnir, Rodher, Sanwal, Sulhan, Tagaley, Teji, Udhar, Ugal-Virk or Virk and Vassan.\n\nThe Hill section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Bahil, Bajwaria, Banta, Bhagley, Bhagra, Basohal, Basalia, Butail, Chakahria, Chakaseday, Chamib, Chaudhri, Chaukand, Chaujar, Chehray, Chimia, Cheemrey, Chhabb, Chonolia, Dagan, Didi, Dhophmal, Doddal, Dogan, Dorela, Dunyal, Indoria, Harail, Haraloo, Indoria, Jallundhroo, Jaiswal, Jandranglu, Jhalya, Jhangra, Jehelghat, Kalandar, Kandal, Karol, Kataway, Kaunsal, Kutharia, Kuthiala, Lahespar, Lakhanty, Lamsay, Lama, Langey, Lasaria, Laserday, Lauriya, Ling, Mahdoodia, Mangwalich, Mariya, Mand, Masoob, Mehtay, Mithoo, Naggal, Nehdal, Pabba, Panbalia, Paptopay, Patopa, Pulkaha, Phagdey, Phalkolia, Sabloria, Sah, Saraup, Sawali, Shall, Takalo and Udhwal.\n\nThe Soods are organized into city specific chapters of their organization in many countries.
