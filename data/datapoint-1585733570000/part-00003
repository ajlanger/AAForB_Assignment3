He was reunited with Warnock in 2002 after he joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] where he spent much of his career and enjoyed notable success; performing in [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[FA Cup]] semi-finals, two play-off finals, and then promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2005\u201306.\n\nKenny would later sign for Warnock once again in 2010, joining [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] after his time at Sheffield United ended on a sour note when he spent much of his final season on the sidelines having failing a drugs test the previous summer.

He was reunited with Warnock in 2002 after he joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] where he spent much of his career and enjoyed notable success; performing in [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[FA Cup]] semi-finals, two play-off finals, and then promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2005\u201306.\n\nKenny would later sign for Warnock once again in 2010, joining [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] after his time at Sheffield United ended on a sour note when he spent much of his final season on the sidelines having failing a drugs test the previous summer. During his first season at QPR he would achieve his second promotion to the Premier League and his first [[Football League Championship|Championship]] winners medal.
