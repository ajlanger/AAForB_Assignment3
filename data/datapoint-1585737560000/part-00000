It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy. Jackson received a minimum upfront payment of three million dollars for accepting the role, and an additional one million to record the movie's theme.<ref name=\"Daily\" />\n\nThe song's initial concept was based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be suitable for the film's theme. She stated \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> Following its release, Jackson felt that it was \"fun\" and \"a good summer song\".<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.girl.com.au/janetjackson.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 June 2001 |work=Girl.com.au |author=Gamboa, Glenn |access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> She initially felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success.<ref name=\"Interview\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album.

Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself.

Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy. Jackson received a minimum upfront payment of three million dollars for accepting the role, and an additional one million to record the movie's theme.<ref name=\"Daily\" />\n\nThe song's initial concept was based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be suitable for the film's theme. She stated \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> Following its release, Jackson felt that it was \"fun\" and \"a good summer song\".<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.girl.com.au/janetjackson.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 June 2001 |work=Girl.com.au |author=Gamboa, Glenn |access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> She initially felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success.<ref name=\"Interview\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album.

Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself.

Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!
