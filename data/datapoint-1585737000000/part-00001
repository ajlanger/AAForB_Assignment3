An important period in Russian history was the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from 1547 until 1721 where many Russian cultural peculiarities emerged and developed. At different periods in Russian history, the culture of Western Europe also exerted strong influences over Russian citizens. During the era of the [[Russian Empire]] which existed from 1721 to 1917, the Tsar's title was abolished and the rulers of Russia were called [[Emperor]]s. Since the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682\u20131725) in the Russian Empire, for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of [[European culture]] rather than pursuing its own unique ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-and-the-world/knowledge-transfer/martin-aust-russia-and-europe-1547-1917|title=Russia and Europe (1547\u20131917) Russia and Europe (1547\u20131917)|last=Aust|first=Martin|website=EGO(http://www.ieg-ego.eu)|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> The situation changed in the 20th century, when the distinctive [[Communism|Communist ideology]] imported from Europe became a major factor in the [[Soviet culture|culture of the Soviet Union]], where Russia, in the form of the [[Russian SFSR]], was the largest and leading part.

Epic Russian [[bylina]]s are also an important part of [[Slavic mythology]]. The oldest bylinas of [[Kiev]]an cycle were actually recorded mostly in the [[Northwestern Federal District|Russian North]], especially in [[Karelia]], where most of the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] national epic [[Kalevala]] was recorded as well. \n[[File:Ivanbilibin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Buyan]]'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]\n\nMany [[Russian fairy tale]]s and bylinas were adapted for [[Russian animation]]s, or for feature movies by famous directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Some Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.\n\nFolklorists today consider the 1920s the [[Soviet Union]]'s golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the [[Russian formalism|formalist]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics in the Soviet Union,\" Slavic Review 32 (1973): 45.</ref> The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions.

The image of the crowned double eagle and the central crown which is connected with the other two crowns is often used as a pictorial example of Russias cultural nature. One crowned head looks to Europe and reflects the Western European element in Russian culture, the other looks to Asia and symbolizes the Asian Oriental element in Russia. Both are connected to a big third crown. Russian culture is connected with European and Asian cultures and was influenced by both.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lukin20030328.pdf|title=Russia between East and West: Perceptions and Reality|last=Lukin|first=Alexander|date=2003}}</ref>]]\nOnce [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power and put his [[first five-year plan]] into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the [[Bolsheviks]] were working to surpass.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"The Political Uses and Themes of Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Journal of the Folklore Institute 12 (1975): 157.</ref> To keep folklore studies in check and prevent \"inappropriate\" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP \u2013 the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and \"bourgeois nonsense\" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science.<ref>William B. Husband, \"\u2019Correcting Nature's Mistakes\u2019: Transforming the Environment and Soviet Children's Literature, 1828\u20131941,\" Environmental History 11 (2006): 304.</ref> RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1932.\n[[File:Viktor Vasnetsov - \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0438 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]. The three [[epic hero|hero]]es of [[bylina|Russian mythology]]: (l-r) [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]]]]\n\nIn order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, [[Maksim Gorky]] gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen.<ref>Grimes Farrer, \"The Soviet Folktale as an Ideological Strategy for Survival in International Business Relations,\" Studies in Soviet Thought 13 (1973): 55.</ref> Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 47.</ref> Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nYuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat.<ref>Frank J. Miller, \"The Image of Stalin in Soviet Russian Folklore,\" Russian Review 39 (1980): 51.</ref> Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens.<ref>[[Margaret Schlauch]], \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Science and Society 8 (1944): 213.</ref> He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 215.</ref>\nConvinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 160.</ref> Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Sadko - Google Art Project levels adjustment 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sadko]] in the Underwater Tsardom'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nApart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the [[renaissance]] of the Russian epic.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 169.</ref> Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 161.</ref> As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of [[Marxist]] ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 54.</ref>  Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 164.</ref>\n\nThese new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 48.</ref> Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the \"[[New Soviet Man]].\"<ref>Farrer, \"Ideological Strategy,\" 57.</ref> The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 220.</ref> Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the \"New Soviet Man.\"<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 55.</ref> The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the [[Whites]] and their leader Idolisce, \"the most monstrous idol,\" who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the [[Tartars]] in byliny.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 166.</ref> In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.<ref>Husband, \"Transforming the Environment,\" 305.\"</ref>\n\nOnce Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 172.</ref> Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature. Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 64.</ref> Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales of the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period of restraint and falsehood.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Russian literature|List of Russian-language poets|List of Russian-language writers}}\n[[Russian literature]] is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, with some of the most famous literary works belonging to it.<ref name=\"Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007\"/> Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century; in the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]], and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time.

The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]. Previously dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]], Russian literature came under strong influence of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok|Aleksandr Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].\n\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new state, the [[Soviet Union]]. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of [[socialist realism]]. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines.

Authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Ivan Yefremov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time.

[[Russian philosophy]] blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]].\n\nIn its further developments, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in [[creativity]], society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Vladimir Lossky]] and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by [[Marxism]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]<br /><small>(1814\u20131876)</small>\n! align=center |[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]<br /><small>(1842\u20131921)</small>\n! align=center |[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]<br /><small>(1853\u20131900)</small>\n! align=center |[[Lev Shestov|Shestov]]<br /><small>(1866\u20131938)</small>\n! align=center |[[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev]]<br /><small>(1874\u20131948)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Bakunin.png|137px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|128px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:V.Solovyov.jpg|116px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Si L\u00e9on Chestov noong 1927.jpg|126px]] || align=\"left\" |[[File:Berdiayev001.jpg|center|frameless|184x184px]]\n|}\n\n===Humour===\n{{Main|Russian humour|Russian jokes|Chastushka}}\nRussia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly [[word play]] to [[political satire]].\n\n[[Russian jokes]], the most popular form of [[Russian humour]], are short fictional stories or dialogues with a [[punch line]]. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or [[mother-in-law joke|mothers-in-law]].\n\n[[Chastushka]], a type of traditional [[Russian poetry]], is a single [[quatrain]] in [[trochee|trochaic]] [[tetrameter]] with an \"abab\" or \"abcb\" [[rhyme scheme]]. Usually [[humor]]ous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. The name originates from the Russian word ''\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c'', meaning \"to speak fast.\"\n\n==Visual arts==\nRussian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like [[Ukraine]] or [[Belarus]].\n\nAs early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] and its derivative, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nKremlin Tower Clock, 1913, House of Faberge, Russia, rhodonite, silver, enamel, emeralds, sapphires - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08964.JPG|Kremlin Tower Clock; 1913; [[rhodonite]], silver, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], emeralds, sapphires; by House of [[Faberg\u00e9]]; Cleveland Museum of Art\nPeter Carl Faberg\u00e9 - Tea Set - 1966.500 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Russian tea set; by [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]]; made before 1896; silver gilt and opaque cloisonne enamel; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (USA)\nFedor I.

Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]], until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church]]es, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. [[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great reforms]] had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the splendid works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] was transformed into an outdoor museum of [[Neoclassical architecture]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and [[Russian Revival]] style (this corresponds to [[Gothic Revival]] in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Fyodor Shekhtel]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Moisei Ginzburg]] and [[Victor Vesnin]]), and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalin Empire style]] ([[Boris Iofan]]). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the \"excesses\" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the [[Soviet Union]] the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in [[World War II]]. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though [[International style (architecture)|International style]] has a great influence.\n\nSome notable Russian buildings include:\n*[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] | [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)]] | [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] | [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]] | [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] | [[Cathedral of the Archangel]] | [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] | [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] | [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Kremlin]] | [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] | [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] | [[Sukharev Tower]] | [[Menshikov Tower]] | [[Moscow Manege]] | [[Narva Triumphal Gate]] | [[Kolomenskoye]] | [[Peterhof Palace]] | [[Gatchina]] | [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] | [[Solovetsky Monastery]] | [[Kunstkamera]] | [[Russian Museum]] | [[Catherine Palace]] | [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] | [[Winter Palace]] | [[Simonov Monastery]] | [[Novodevichy Convent]] | [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] | [[Tatlin's Tower]] | [[Palace of the Soviets]] | [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)]] | [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]] | [[Ostankino Tower]] | [[Triumph-Palace]] | [[White House of Russia]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSaint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod.jpg|[[Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod|Cathedral of St. Sophia]] in [[Novgorod]]\nMoscow July 2011-7a.jpg|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] from [[Moscow]]\nDormition Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|[[Cathedral of the Dormition|Dormition Cathedral]] in Moscow\n0 4707b 6549aa91 spasskaya.jpg|[[Spasskaya Tower]] from [[Moscow Kremlin]]\nMoscou.- La Cath\u00e9drale Basile-le-Bienheureux.jpg|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow\nSaint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] from [[Saint Petersburg]]\nMari\u00e4-Entschlafens-Kathedrale und Brunnenkapelle.jpg|Assumption Cathedral in [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]]\nKizhi churches.jpg|The 22-dome Transfiguration Church from [[Kizhi Island]]\n\"\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\".jpg|[[Church of the Savior on Blood]] in Saint Petersburg\nWinter Palace Panorama 4.jpg|The [[Winter Palace]] from Saint Petersburg\n\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 - panoramio (114).jpg|[[GUM (department store)|GUM]] in Moscow\nMoscow BolshayaYakimanka43 X10.jpg|[[Igumnov House]] in Moscow\nRizhskaya.jpg|[[Moscow Rizhsky railway station|Rizhsky station]] from Moscow\n\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a. \u0414\u043e\u043c \u0428\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0445 1.JPG|Lace house in [[Irkutsk]]\n\"\u0423\u0441\u0430\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0412.\u041f. \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\", \u0444\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0434 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438.jpg|Sukachev's Cottage from Irkutsk\nKazan.

A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate. The theme is usually peasant girls in traditional dress, but can be almost anything; for instance, fairy tales or Soviet leaders.\n\nOther forms of Russian handicraft include [[khokhloma]], [[Dymkovo toy]], [[Gzhel (ceramics)|gzhel]], [[Zhostovo painting]], [[Filimonov toy]]s, [[Pysanka|pisanka]], [[Pavlovo Posad shawl]], [[Rushnyk]], and [[palekh miniature|palekh]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\n\u0410\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u04301.jpg|A [[Gzhel]] [[samovar]]\nFile:Poup\u00e9es russes.JPG|Matryoshka dolls in a market\nFile:Russian-Matroshka.jpg|[[Matryoshka doll]]\n\u0425\u043e\u0445\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0435.jpg|A Khokhloma painting on a cutting board\nFile:\u0414\u044b\u043c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0433. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c).JPG|[[Dymkovo toys]] in a store\nFile:Podnos.jpg|A [[Zhostovo painting]]\nFile:Toy of Filimonovo 02.jpg|Some [[Filimonovo toy]]s\nFile:Pyssanka1.jpg|[[Pysanka]]s\nFile:Russian lacquered box - Suzdal.png|Lacquered box with a [[Kholuy miniature]], depicting the town of [[Suzdal]]\n\u041f\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c.jpg|A Permogorsk painting on wood\nFile:\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438.jpg|[[Rushnyk]], old traditional Russian weaving style.

Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner (see [[Icon Corner]]). There is a rich history and elaborate [[religious symbolism]] associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an ''[[iconostasis]]'' (Russian ''ikonost\u00e1s'') a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].<ref name=icons>[http://www.geographia.com/russia/rusart01.htm Russian Art and Architecture]</ref>\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by [[Patriarch Nikon]] resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"[[Old Believers]]\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The [[Stroganov School|Stroganov movement]] and the icons from [[Nevyansk]] rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMeister der Schule von Nowgorod 002.jpg|Icon of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]; circa 1360; by the [[Novgorod School]]; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nFile:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|''[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Holy Trinity, Hospitality of Abraham]]''; by [[Andrei Rublev]]; c. 1411; tempera on panel; 1.1 x 1.4 m (4&nbsp;ft 8 in x 3&nbsp;ft 8{{fraction|3|4}} in); [[Tretyakov Gallery]] (Moscow)\n\u0421\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u00ab\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb, \u00ab\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u044b\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb..jpg|A three-leaved fold with the image of the \"Annunciation\", \"Trinity\" and \"Presentation\"; the end of the 17th century; temperaon wood; 13 x 7.3&nbsp;cm; [[National Art Museum of Azerbaijan]] ([[Baku]])\n\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 (\u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\". \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c XVIII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e, \u043b\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0441, \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430..jpg|Icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker (Dvorischensky); 18th century; wood, gesso & tempera; [[Ryabushinsky Museum of Icons and Paintings]] ([[Moscow]]) \n</gallery>\n\n===Lubok===\n{{main|Lubok}}\nA lubok (plural ''Lubki'', [[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043a, \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}) is a Russian [[popular print]], characterized by simple [[graphics]] and [[narrative]]s derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales.

Notable portrait painters from the Academy include [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Fyodor Rokotov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], and [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].\n\n===Realist painting===\n{{main|Peredvizhniki|Russian artists}}\n[[File:Hovhannes Aivazovsky - The Ninth Wave - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Ninth Wave]]'' by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]]]\n[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 009.jpg|thumb|''[[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and [[birch]] clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Social realism|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''wanderers'') group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] and [[Ilya Repin]].\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]]. Many works by the [[Peredvizhniki]] group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during [[Russian Art Week]] in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.\n\n===Russian avant-garde===\n{{Main|Russian avant-garde|List of Russian artists|Russian Futurism}}\nThe [[Russian avant-garde]] is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism|futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Pavel Filonov]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nIn the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Naum Gabo]] and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGlass (Larionov 1912).jpg|''The glass''; by [[Mikhail Larionov]]; 1912; oil on canvas; 104 \u00d7 97&nbsp;cm (40.9 \u00d7 38.1 in.); [[Solomon R.

The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for \"Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii\" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Initially, [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. ''De facto'' restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with [[socialist realism]] including [[Ernst Neizvestny]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Mikhail Shemyakin]], [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]], [[Erik Bulatov]], and [[Vera Mukhina]]. They employed techniques as varied as [[primitivism]], [[hyperrealism]], [[grotesque]], and [[abstraction]]. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] in the 1940s. After the [[Great Patriotic War]] Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.\n\n==Performance arts==\n\n=== Russian folk music ===\n{{main|Russian traditional music}}\n[[File:Balalaika.JPG|thumb|A [[balalaika]]]]\nRussians have distinctive traditions of [[Music of Russia#Folk music|folk music]].

Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, most prominent being [[Golden Ring (band)|Golden Ring]], [[Ural's Nation Choir]], [[Lyudmila Zykina]]. [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic songs of the [[Music of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular Russian ensembles.\n\n=== Russian folk dance ===\n{{main|Russian folk dances}}\nRussian folk dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances [[Khorovod]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430 or \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic.

Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. Rozhdestvo (Orthodox Christmas) falls on 7 January, because [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar|Julian (old style) calendar]] and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are [[Easter|Paskha]] (Easter) and [[Trinity Sunday|Troitsa]] ([[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]]), but there is no need to recognize them as public holidays since they are always celebrated on Sunday.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[International Workers' Day]] (1 May), now renamed ''Spring and Labor Day''; [[Victory Day (9 May)]]; [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania]]n occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the old Soviet holiday celebrating [[October Revolution]] of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars).

Similar parades are organized in all major Russian cities and the cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nOther popular holidays, which are not public, include [[Old New Year]] (New Year according to [[Julian Calendar]] on 1 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (day of Russian students on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (an old pagan holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (a day of [[Yury Gagarin]]'s first ever human trip into space on 12 April), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pagan [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] holiday on 7 July) and [[The Tale of Peter and Fevronia|Peter and Fevronia Day]] (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of [[Valentine's Day]], which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity).

The early Cossack communities emerged in the 14th century, the first, among others, were the [[Don Cossacks]]. Other Cossack communities that have played an important role in Russia's history and culture are the [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Volga Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Cossacks defended the Russian borders and expanded Russia's territory. The regions of the large Cossack communities enjoyed many freedoms in [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist Russia]].

The handcraft [[Khokhloma|Hohloma]] which originated in the [[Volga region]] is made out of wood and depicts numerous plants of the forest, like the berry [[Viburnum opulus]] (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430, Kalina), [[flower]]s and leaves.

Undefeated lightweight [[UFC]] champion [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]] is from [[Makhachkala]] and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over [[Conor McGregor]].\n\n==National symbols==\n{{main|Cultural icons of Russia|Flag of Russia|Coat of arms of Russia|National anthem of Russia|Russian Bear|Mother Russia}}\n\n===State symbols===\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[Coat of arms of Moscow|St. George]] of Moscow in the [[Russian coat of arms]]; these symbols date from the time of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. The [[Russian flag]] appeared in the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and became widely used during the era of the [[Russian Empire]]. The current [[Russian national anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The [[Hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on [[military equipment]] and [[war memorial]]s. The Soviet [[Red Banner]] is still honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n[[File:Russian-Matroshka2.jpg|thumb|Dissected [[Matryoshka doll]]]]\n\n===Unofficial symbols===\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian national Olympic team]]. [[Saint Mary|Mary]], [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Saint Andrew]], [[Saint George]], [[Saint Alexander Nevsky]], [[Saint Sergius of Radonezh]], [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's patron saints. [[Chamomile]] is a flower that Russians often associate with their [[Motherland]], while [[birch]] is a [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is \"\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\" [[Mother Motherland]] (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill \"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called [[Mother Russia]] at the West.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the [[World Tourism rankings|most popular tourist destinations]] in the world. The country [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|contains 29 UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=ru Tentative Lists]</ref> Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian [[banya (sauna)|banya]], Tatar [[Sabantuy]], or Siberian [[shamanist]] rituals.\n\n===Cultural tourism===\n[[File:Grand Cascade in Peterhof 01.jpg|thumb|Grand Cascade in [[Peterhof Palace]], nicknamed ''Russian Versailles'', a popular tourist destination in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]\nMost popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as [[World Cities]]. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares like [[Red Square]] and [[Palace Square]], and streets like [[Tverskaya Street|Tverskaya]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former [[Template:Imperial palaces in Russia|imperial residences]] in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and Saint Petersburg ([[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a unique mix of Christian [[Russians|Russian]] and Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar]] cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]], all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Pskov]] and the cities of Golden Ring ([[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]] and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval [[Rus (name)|Rus']], and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many [[List of castles in Russia|old fortifications]] (typically [[Kremlin]]s), [[List of Russian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|churches]] are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.\n\n===Resorts and nature tourism===\n[[File:Dombai 3760 Gornolyzhnie Trassy.jpg|thumb|The [[ski resort]] at [[Dombay]], [[Western Caucasus]].]]\nThe warm subtropical [[Black Sea]] coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea [[resort]]s, like [[Sochi]], known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major [[ski resort]]s, like [[Krasnaya Polyana]]; the city is the host of [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain many other popular [[ski resort]]s, like [[Dombay, Karachay\u2013Cherkess Republic|Dombay]] in [[Karachay\u2013Cherkessia]].\n\nThe most famous natural tourist destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], named ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains.\n\nOther popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its [[volcano]]es and [[geyser]]s, [[Karelia]] with its many lakes and [[granite]] rocks, [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] with its snowy mountains and [[Tyva]] with its wild steppes.\n\n{{World Heritage Sites in Russia|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n==Timeline==\n* 1801\u20131914: Upper classes in Russia spoke French, some even as their first language, which became a problem during Napoleon's invasion; the Golden Age of [[Russian poetry]] and [[Russian literature]]; Pushkin & Lermontov.\n* early 20th century: Silver Age of Russian literature\n* 1917\u20131932: Constructivism.

An important period in Russian history was the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from 1547 until 1721 where many Russian cultural peculiarities emerged and developed. At different periods in Russian history, the culture of Western Europe also exerted strong influences over Russian citizens. During the era of the [[Russian Empire]] which existed from 1721 to 1917, the Tsar's title was abolished and the rulers of Russia were called [[Emperor]]s. Since the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682-1725) in the Russian Empire, for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of [[European culture]] rather than pursuing its own unique ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-and-the-world/knowledge-transfer/martin-aust-russia-and-europe-1547-1917|title=Russia and Europe (1547\u20131917) Russia and Europe (1547\u20131917)|last=Aust|first=Martin|website=EGO(http://www.ieg-ego.eu)|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> The situation changed in the 20th century, when the distinctive [[Communism|Communist ideology]] imported from Europe became a major factor in the [[Soviet culture|culture of the Soviet Union]], where Russia, in the form of the [[Russian SFSR]], was the largest and leading part.

Epic Russian [[bylina]]s are also an important part of [[Slavic mythology]]. The oldest bylinas of [[Kiev]]an cycle were actually recorded mostly in the [[Northwestern Federal District|Russian North]], especially in [[Karelia]], where most of the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] national epic [[Kalevala]] was recorded as well. \n[[File:Ivanbilibin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Buyan]]'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]\n\nMany [[Russian fairy tale]]s and bylinas were adapted for [[Russian animation]]s, or for feature movies by famous directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Some Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.\n\nFolklorists today consider the 1920s the [[Soviet Union]]'s golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the [[Russian formalism|formalist]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics in the Soviet Union,\" Slavic Review 32 (1973): 45.</ref> The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions.

The image of the crowned double eagle and the central crown which is connected with the other two crowns is often used as a pictorial example of Russias cultural nature. One crowned head looks to Europe and reflects the Western European element in Russian culture, the other looks to Asia and symbolizes the Asian Oriental element in Russia. Both are connected to a big third crown. Russian culture is connected with European and Asian cultures and was influenced by both.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lukin20030328.pdf|title=Russia between East and West: Perceptions and Reality|last=Lukin|first=Alexander|date=2003}}</ref>]]\nOnce [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power and put his [[first five-year plan]] into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the [[Bolsheviks]] were working to surpass.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"The Political Uses and Themes of Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Journal of the Folklore Institute 12 (1975): 157.</ref> To keep folklore studies in check and prevent \"inappropriate\" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP \u2013 the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and \"bourgeois nonsense\" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science.<ref>William B. Husband, \"\u2019Correcting Nature's Mistakes\u2019: Transforming the Environment and Soviet Children's Literature, 1828\u20131941,\" Environmental History 11 (2006): 304.</ref> RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1932.\n[[File:Viktor Vasnetsov - \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0438 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]. The three [[epic hero|hero]]es of [[bylina|Russian mythology]]: (l-r) [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]]]]\n\nIn order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, [[Maksim Gorky]] gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen.<ref>Grimes Farrer, \"The Soviet Folktale as an Ideological Strategy for Survival in International Business Relations,\" Studies in Soviet Thought 13 (1973): 55.</ref> Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 47.</ref> Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nYuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat.<ref>Frank J. Miller, \"The Image of Stalin in Soviet Russian Folklore,\" Russian Review 39 (1980): 51.</ref> Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens.<ref>[[Margaret Schlauch]], \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Science and Society 8 (1944): 213.</ref> He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 215.</ref>\nConvinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 160.</ref> Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Sadko - Google Art Project levels adjustment 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sadko]] in the Underwater Tsardom'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nApart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the [[renaissance]] of the Russian epic.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 169.</ref> Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 161.</ref> As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of [[Marxist]] ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 54.</ref>  Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 164.</ref>\n\nThese new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 48.</ref> Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the \"[[New Soviet Man]].\"<ref>Farrer, \"Ideological Strategy,\" 57.</ref> The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 220.</ref> Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the \"New Soviet Man.\"<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 55.</ref> The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the [[Whites]] and their leader Idolisce, \"the most monstrous idol,\" who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the [[Tartars]] in byliny.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 166.</ref> In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.<ref>Husband, \"Transforming the Environment,\" 305.\"</ref>\n\nOnce Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 172.</ref> Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature. Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 64.</ref> Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales of the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period of restraint and falsehood.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Russian literature|List of Russian-language poets|List of Russian-language writers}}\n[[Russian literature]] is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, with some of the most famous literary works belonging to it.<ref name=\"Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007\"/> Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century; in the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]], and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]] began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the ''\"Russian Shakespeare\" or the \"Russian Goethe\"''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=0-19-280144-9|year=2001|url=https://archive.org/details/russianliteratur00kell_0}}</ref> It continued in the 19th century with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]], [[Ivan Goncharov]], [[Aleksey Pisemsky]] and [[Nikolai Leskov]]. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures, to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=11 April 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=10 April 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich | date=6 September 1971}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1880s Russian literature had begun to change. The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]. Previously dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]], Russian literature came under strong influence of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok|Aleksandr Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].\n\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new state, the [[Soviet Union]]. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of [[socialist realism]]. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era included [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Yevgeny Zamiatin]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Yury Olesha]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].\n\nThe Soviet era was also the golden age of Russian [[science fiction]], that was initially inspired by western authors and enthusiastically developed with the success of [[Soviet space program]]. Authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Ivan Yefremov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time. An important theme of Russian literature has always been the [[Russian soul]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]<br /><small>(1799\u20131837)</small>\n! align=center |[[Gogol]]<br /><small>(1809\u20131852)</small>\n! align=center |[[Turgenev]]<br /><small>(1818\u20131883)</small>\n! align=center |[[Dostoevsky]]<br /><small>(1821\u20131881)</small>\n! align=center |[[Tolstoy]]<br /><small>(1828\u20131910)</small>\n! align=center |[[Chekhov]]<br /><small>(1860\u20131904)</small>\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov]]<br /><small>(1891\u20131940)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|136px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0413\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f.jpg|129px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Turgenev Perov scanned.JPG|126px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Dostoevskij 1872.jpg|127px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Ilya Efimovich Repin (1844-1930) - Portrait of Leo Tolstoy (1887).jpg|111px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:ChekhovGl 1.jpg|123px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Bu\u0142hakow.jpg|118px]]\n|}\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main|List of Russian philosophers}}\nSome Russian writers, like [[Tolstoy]] and [[Dostoyevsky]], are known also as philosophers, while many more authors are known primarily for their philosophical works. [[Russian philosophy]] blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]].\n\nIn its further developments, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in [[creativity]], society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Vladimir Lossky]] and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by [[Marxism]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]<br /><small>(1814\u20131876)</small>\n! align=center |[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]<br /><small>(1842\u20131921)</small>\n! align=center |[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]<br /><small>(1853\u20131900)</small>\n! align=center |[[Lev Shestov|Shestov]]<br /><small>(1866\u20131938)</small>\n! align=center |[[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev]]<br /><small>(1874\u20131948)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Bakunin.png|137px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|128px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:V.Solovyov.jpg|116px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Si L\u00e9on Chestov noong 1927.jpg|126px]] || align=\"left\" |[[File:Berdiayev001.jpg|center|frameless|184x184px]]\n|}\n\n===Humour===\n{{Main|Russian humour|Russian jokes|Chastushka}}\nRussia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly [[word play]] to [[political satire]].\n\n[[Russian jokes]], the most popular form of [[Russian humour]], are short fictional stories or dialogues with a [[punch line]]. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or [[mother-in-law joke|mothers-in-law]].\n\n[[Chastushka]], a type of traditional [[Russian poetry]], is a single [[quatrain]] in [[trochee|trochaic]] [[tetrameter]] with an \"abab\" or \"abcb\" [[rhyme scheme]]. Usually [[humor]]ous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. The name originates from the Russian word ''\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c'', meaning \"to speak fast.\"\n\n==Visual arts==\nRussian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like [[Ukraine]] or [[Belarus]].\n\nAs early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] and its derivative, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nKremlin Tower Clock, 1913, House of Faberge, Russia, rhodonite, silver, enamel, emeralds, sapphires - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08964.JPG|Kremlin Tower Clock; 1913; [[rhodonite]], silver, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], emeralds, sapphires; by House of [[Faberg\u00e9]]; Cleveland Museum of Art\nPeter Carl Faberg\u00e9 - Tea Set - 1966.500 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Russian tea set; by [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]]; made before 1896; silver gilt and opaque cloisonne enamel; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (USA)\nFedor I.

Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]], until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church]]es, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. [[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great reforms]] had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the splendid works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] was transformed into an outdoor museum of [[Neoclassical architecture]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and [[Russian Revival]] style (this corresponds to [[Gothic Revival]] in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Fyodor Shekhtel]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Moisei Ginzburg]] and [[Victor Vesnin]]), and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalin Empire style]] ([[Boris Iofan]]). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the \"excesses\" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the [[Soviet Union]] the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in [[World War II]]. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though [[International style (architecture)|International style]] has a great influence.\n\nSome notable Russian buildings include:\n*[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] | [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)]] | [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] | [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]] | [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] | [[Cathedral of the Archangel]] | [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] | [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] | [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Kremlin]] | [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] | [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] | [[Sukharev Tower]] | [[Menshikov Tower]] | [[Moscow Manege]] | [[Narva Triumphal Gate]] | [[Kolomenskoye]] | [[Peterhof Palace]] | [[Gatchina]] | [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] | [[Solovetsky Monastery]] | [[Kunstkamera]] | [[Russian Museum]] | [[Catherine Palace]] | [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] | [[Winter Palace]] | [[Simonov Monastery]] | [[Novodevichy Convent]] | [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] | [[Tatlin's Tower]] | [[Palace of the Soviets]] | [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)]] | [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]] | [[Ostankino Tower]] | [[Triumph-Palace]] | [[White House of Russia]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSaint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod.jpg|[[Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod|Cathedral of St. Sophia]] in [[Novgorod]]\nMoscow July 2011-7a.jpg|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] from [[Moscow]]\nDormition Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|[[Cathedral of the Dormition|Dormition Cathedral]] in Moscow\n0 4707b 6549aa91 spasskaya.jpg|[[Spasskaya Tower]] from [[Moscow Kremlin]]\nMoscou.- La Cath\u00e9drale Basile-le-Bienheureux.jpg|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow\nSaint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] from [[Saint Petersburg]]\nMari\u00e4-Entschlafens-Kathedrale und Brunnenkapelle.jpg|Assumption Cathedral in [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]]\nKizhi churches.jpg|The 22-dome Transfiguration Church from [[Kizhi Island]]\n\"\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\".jpg|[[Church of the Savior on Blood]] in Saint Petersburg\nWinter Palace Panorama 4.jpg|The [[Winter Palace]] from Saint Petersburg\n\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 - panoramio (114).jpg|[[GUM (department store)|GUM]] in Moscow\nMoscow BolshayaYakimanka43 X10.jpg|[[Igumnov House]] in Moscow\nRizhskaya.jpg|[[Moscow Rizhsky railway station|Rizhsky station]] from Moscow\n\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a. \u0414\u043e\u043c \u0428\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0445 1.JPG|Lace house in [[Irkutsk]]\n\"\u0423\u0441\u0430\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0412.\u041f. \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\", \u0444\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0434 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438.jpg|Sukachev's Cottage from Irkutsk\nKazan.

A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate.

Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner (see [[Icon Corner]]). There is a rich history and elaborate [[religious symbolism]] associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an ''[[iconostasis]]'' (Russian ''ikonost\u00e1s'') a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].<ref name=icons>[http://www.geographia.com/russia/rusart01.htm Russian Art and Architecture]</ref>\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by [[Patriarch Nikon]] resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"[[Old Believers]]\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The [[Stroganov School|Stroganov movement]] and the icons from [[Nevyansk]] rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMeister der Schule von Nowgorod 002.jpg|Icon of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]; circa 1360; by the [[Novgorod School]]; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nFile:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|''[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Holy Trinity, Hospitality of Abraham]]''; by [[Andrei Rublev]]; c. 1411; tempera on panel; 1.1 x 1.4 m (4&nbsp;ft 8 in x 3&nbsp;ft 8{{fraction|3|4}} in); [[Tretyakov Gallery]] (Moscow)\n\u0421\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u00ab\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb, \u00ab\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u044b\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb..jpg|A three-leaved fold with the image of the \"Annunciation\", \"Trinity\" and \"Presentation\"; the end of the 17th century; temperaon wood; 13 x 7.3&nbsp;cm; [[National Art Museum of Azerbaijan]] ([[Baku]])\n\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 (\u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\". \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c XVIII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e, \u043b\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0441, \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430..jpg|Icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker (Dvorischensky); 18th century; wood, gesso & tempera; [[Ryabushinsky Museum of Icons and Paintings]] ([[Moscow]]) \n</gallery>\n\n===Lubok===\n{{main|Lubok}}\nA lubok (plural ''Lubki'', [[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043a, \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}) is a Russian [[popular print]], characterized by simple [[graphics]] and [[narrative]]s derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were [[woodcut]]s, then [[engraving]]s or [[etching]]s were typical, and from the mid-19th century [[lithography]]. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern [[comic strip]]. Cheap and simple books, similar to [[chapbook]]s,<ref>Lyons, Martyn. \"Books: A Living History\".

Notable portrait painters from the Academy include [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Fyodor Rokotov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], and [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].\n\n===Realist painting===\n{{main|Peredvizhniki|Russian artists}}\n[[File:Hovhannes Aivazovsky - The Ninth Wave - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Ninth Wave]]'' by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]]]\n[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 009.jpg|thumb|''[[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and [[birch]] clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Social realism|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''wanderers'') group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] and [[Ilya Repin]].\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]]. Many works by the [[Peredvizhniki]] group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during [[Russian Art Week]] in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.\n\n===Russian avant-garde===\n{{Main|Russian avant-garde|List of Russian artists|Russian Futurism}}\nThe [[Russian avant-garde]] is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism|futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Pavel Filonov]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nIn the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Naum Gabo]] and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGlass (Larionov, 1912).jpg|''The glass''; by [[Mikhail Larionov]]; 1912; oil on canvas; 104 \u00d7 97&nbsp;cm (40.9 \u00d7 38.1 in.); [[Solomon R.

The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for \"Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii\" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Initially, [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. ''De facto'' restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with [[socialist realism]] including [[Ernst Neizvestny]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Mikhail Shemyakin]], [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]], [[Erik Bulatov]], and [[Vera Mukhina]]. They employed techniques as varied as [[primitivism]], [[hyperrealism]], [[grotesque]], and [[abstraction]]. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] in the 1940s. After the [[Great Patriotic War]] Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.\n\n==Performance arts==\n\n=== Russian folk music ===\n{{main|Russian traditional music}}\n[[File:Balalaika.JPG|thumb|A [[balalaika]]]]\nRussians have distinctive traditions of [[Music of Russia#Folk music|folk music]].

Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, most prominent being [[Golden Ring (band)|Golden Ring]], [[Ural's Nation Choir]], [[Lyudmila Zykina]]. [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic songs of the [[Music of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular Russian ensembles.\n\n=== Russian folk dance ===\n{{main|Russian folk dances}}\nRussian folk dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances [[Khorovod]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430 or \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic.

This was followed by several operas such as ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' in 1842. Russian opera was originally a combination of Russian folk music and [[Italian opera]]. After the [[October revolution]] many opera composers left Russia. Russia's most popular operas include ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'', ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'', ''[[Prince Igor]]'', and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''.\n\n===Modern music===\n{{main|Russian rock|Russian pop}}\n[[File:Berkut flies.jpg|thumb|left|[[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] band [[Aria (band)|Aria]] is one of the leading [[Russian rock]] performers.]]\nSince the late Soviet times Russia has experienced another wave of [[Western culture|Western cultural]] influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the [[Russian rock]] music, which takes its roots both in the Western [[rock and roll]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and in traditions of the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|Russian bards]] of Soviet era, like [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]]. [[Saint-Petersburg]] (former [[Leningrad]]), [[Yekaterinburg]] (former Sverdlovsk) and [[Omsk]] became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[Slot (band)|Slot]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]] and [[Korol i Shut]]. At the same time [[Russian pop]] music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as ''estrada'' into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like [[t.A.T.u.]] in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or [[Vitas]] in China.

[[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' (\"film-eye\") theory\u2014that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life\u2014had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism.

Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for a plethora of breads, [[pancake]]s, cereals, [[kvass]], beer, and [[vodka]]. Black bread is relatively more popular in Russia compared to the rest of the world. Soups, stews and filled dumplings are very characteristic for Russian cuisine. The most popular soups include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. Most popular dumplings are [[pirozhki]], [[pelmeni]], varenyky and Turkic [[Manti (food)|manti]]. One of the most popular are foods are [[blini]], which are like [[syrniki]] native types of Russian pancakes. Furthermore, [[Cutlet]]s (like [[Chicken Kiev]]) and [[shashlyk]] are popular meat dishes, the last one being of [[Tatar]] and [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} origin respectively. Popular salads include [[Russian Salad]], [[vinaigrette]] and [[Dressed Herring]].

The New Year is the first in calendar and in popularity. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. Rozhdestvo (Orthodox Christmas) falls on 7 January, because [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar|Julian (old style) calendar]] and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are [[Easter|Paskha]] (Easter) and [[Trinity Sunday|Troitsa]] ([[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]]), but there is no need to recognize them as public holidays since they are always celebrated on Sunday.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[International Workers' Day]] (1 May), now renamed ''Spring and Labor Day''; [[Victory Day (9 May)]]; [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania]]n occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the old Soviet holiday celebrating [[October Revolution]] of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian public holidays.\n\n[[File:Victory Day Parade 2008-14.jpg|thumb|left|2008 [[Victory Day (9 May)]] parade on Moscow's [[Red Square]].]]\n[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] is the second popular holiday in Russia, it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]] and is widely celebrated throughout Russia. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of the Russian Federation]], is annually organized in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades are organized in all major Russian cities and the cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nOther popular holidays, which are not public, include [[Old New Year]] (New Year according to [[Julian Calendar]] on 1 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (day of Russian students on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (an old pagan holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (a day of [[Yury Gagarin]]'s first ever human trip into space on 12 April), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pagan [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] holiday on 7 July) and [[The Tale of Peter and Fevronia|Peter and Fevronia Day]] (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of [[Valentine's Day]], which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity). On different days in June there are major celebrations of the end of the school year, when graduates from schools and universities traditionally swim in the city fountains; the local varieties of these public events include [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] tradition in [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Russia}}\n[[File:Moscow - Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.jpg|thumb|254x254px|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].|alt=]]\n[[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and Judaism are Russia's traditional religions, deemed part of Russia's \"historical heritage\" in a law passed in 1997.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bell, I|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&pg=PA47|accessdate=27 December 2007|isbn=9781857431377}}</ref>\nEstimates of believers widely fluctuate among sources, and some reports put the number of non-believers in Russia as high as 16\u201348% of the population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zuckerman, P|title=Atheism: Contemporary Rates and Patterns, chapter in The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, ed. by Michael Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=}}</ref> [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] is the dominant religion in Russia.<ref name=relig>{{cite web|title=Religion In Russia|publisher=Embassy of the Russian Federation|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/religion.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219055545/http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/religion.htm|archivedate=19 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] while there are a number of [[Religion in Russia#Registered religious organizations|smaller Orthodox Churches]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445, \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041f\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u044b|date=December 2006|url=http://www.religare.ru/article36302.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007|language=ru}}</ref> However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis.

The early Cossack communities emerged in the 14th century, the first, among others, were the [[Don Cossacks]]. Other Cossack communities that have played an important role in Russia's history and culture are the [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Volga Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Cossacks defended the Russian borders and expanded Russia's territory. The regions of the large Cossack communities enjoyed many freedoms in [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist Russia]].

Russian players [[Valeri Kharlamov]], [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]], [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and [[Vladislav Tretiak]] hold four of the six positions on the [[IIHF]] Team of the Century.<ref>[http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/news/news-singleview-world-championship/article/iihf-centennial-all-star-team.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=552&cHash=3a26b76f60 IIHF Centennial All-Star Team]</ref> As with some other sports, the Russian ice hockey programme suffered after the breakup of the Soviet Union, with Russia enduring a 15-year gold medal drought. At that time many prominent Russian players made their careers in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). In recent years Russia has reemerged as a hockey power, winning back to back gold medals in the [[2008 IIHF World Championships|2008]] and [[2009 IIHF World Championship|2009]] World Championships, and overtaking [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] as the [[2009 IIHF World Ranking|top ranked]] ice hockey team in the world, but then lost to Canada in the quarter-finals of the 2010 Olympics and 2010 World Junior Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship-oc09/home/news/news-singleview-world-championship-2009/article/pure-gold-russia-repeats.html?tx_ttnewsbackPid=2717&cHash=f61f91921e|accessdate=11 May 2009|title=Pure gold: Russia repeats!|publisher=[[IIHF]]}}</ref> The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) was founded in 2008 as a rival of the NHL.\n\n===Bandy===\n[[Bandy]], known in Russian as \"hockey with a ball\" and sometimes informally as \"Russian hockey\" (as opposed to \"Canadian hockey\", an informal name for ice hockey), is another traditionally popular ice sport, with national league games averaging around 3,500 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/content.html?PageID=325|title=XV \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u044e \u0441 \u043c\u044f\u0447\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d 2006/07 \u0433.\u0433.

[[Russia national bandy team|The Russian team]] is the reigning world champion since [[2014 Bandy World Championship|the 2014 tournament]], having defended the title in [[2015 Bandy World Championship|2015]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:RussianBear.JPG|left|thumb|Russian football fans with a gigantic ''Go Russia!'' banner, featuring [[Russian Bear]] on the background of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]].]]\nDuring the Soviet period, Russia was also a competitive [[Association football|footballing]] nation. Despite having legendary players such as goalkeeper of the century [[Lev Yashin]], the USSR never really managed to assert itself as one of the major forces of international football, although its teams won various championships (such as [[Euro 1960]]) and reached numerous finals (such as [[Euro 1988]]). Along with ice hockey and basketball, football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs (such as [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[Zenit St Petersburg]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow]], and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]) are becoming increasingly successful on the European stage (CSKA and Zenit winning the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008 respectively). The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. The nation also hosted the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as well as the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] at which the national team lost in the Quarterfinals 4-2 on penalty kicks to [[Croatia]], their best ever finish as an independent nation.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Martial arts===\n{{Main|Russian martial arts}}\nRussia has an extensive history of martial arts. Some of its best-known forms include the [[Russian fist fighting|fistfight]], [[Sambo(martial art)|Sambo]], and [[Systema]] with its derivatives [[Ryabko's Systema]] and [[Retuinskih's System ROSS]]. Undefeated lightweight [[UFC]] champion [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]] is from [[Makhachkala]] and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over [[Conor McGregor]].\n\n==National symbols==\n{{main|Cultural icons of Russia|Flag of Russia|Coat of arms of Russia|National anthem of Russia|Russian Bear|Mother Russia}}\n\n===State symbols===\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[Coat of arms of Moscow|St. George]] of Moscow in the [[Russian coat of arms]]; these symbols date from the time of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. The [[Russian flag]] appeared in the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and became widely used during the era of the [[Russian Empire]]. The current [[Russian national anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The [[Hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on [[military equipment]] and [[war memorial]]s. The Soviet [[Red Banner]] is still honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n[[File:Russian-Matroshka2.jpg|thumb|Dissected [[Matryoshka doll]]]]\n\n===Unofficial symbols===\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian national Olympic team]]. [[Saint Mary|Mary]], [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Saint Andrew]], [[Saint George]], [[Saint Alexander Nevsky]], [[Saint Sergius of Radonezh]], [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's patron saints. [[Chamomile]] is a flower that Russians often associate with their [[Motherland]], while [[birch]] is a [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is \"\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\" [[Mother Motherland]] (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill \"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called [[Mother Russia]] at the West.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the [[World Tourism rankings|most popular tourist destinations]] in the world. The country [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|contains 29 UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=ru Tentative Lists]</ref> Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian [[banya (sauna)|banya]], Tatar [[Sabantuy]], or Siberian [[shamanist]] rituals.\n\n===Cultural tourism===\n[[File:Grand Cascade in Peterhof 01.jpg|thumb|Grand Cascade in [[Peterhof Palace]], nicknamed ''Russian Versailles'', a popular tourist destination in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]\nMost popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as [[World Cities]]. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares like [[Red Square]] and [[Palace Square]], and streets like [[Tverskaya Street|Tverskaya]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former [[Template:Imperial palaces in Russia|imperial residences]] in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and Saint Petersburg ([[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a unique mix of Christian [[Russians|Russian]] and Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar]] cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]], all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Pskov]] and the cities of Golden Ring ([[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]] and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval [[Rus (name)|Rus']], and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many [[List of castles in Russia|old fortifications]] (typically [[Kremlin]]s), [[List of Russian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|churches]] are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.\n\n===Resorts and nature tourism===\n[[File:Dombai 3760 Gornolyzhnie Trassy.jpg|thumb|The [[ski resort]] at [[Dombay]], [[Western Caucasus]].]]\nThe warm subtropical [[Black Sea]] coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea [[resort]]s, like [[Sochi]], known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major [[ski resort]]s, like [[Krasnaya Polyana]]; the city is the host of [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain many other popular [[ski resort]]s, like [[Dombay, Karachay\u2013Cherkess Republic|Dombay]] in [[Karachay\u2013Cherkessia]].\n\nThe most famous natural tourist destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], named ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains.\n\nOther popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its [[volcano]]es and [[geyser]]s, [[Karelia]] with its many lakes and [[granite]] rocks, [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] with its snowy mountains and [[Tyva]] with its wild steppes.\n\n{{World Heritage Sites in Russia|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n==Timeline==\n* 1801\u20131914: Upper classes in Russia spoke French, some even as their first language, which became a problem during Napoleon's invasion; the Golden Age of [[Russian poetry]] and [[Russian literature]]; Pushkin & Lermontov.\n* early 20th century: Silver Age of Russian literature\n* 1917\u20131932: Constructivism.
