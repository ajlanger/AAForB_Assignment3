With the emergence of a new settlement to support the activities of the harbour, the name of Syltholm was changed to \"R\u00f8dbyhavn\". 1916 saw the construction of a first shipyard, but by the 1920s, the shipbuilding business at R\u00f8dbyhavn ran into bankruptcy, and activity in the harbour stagnated.
