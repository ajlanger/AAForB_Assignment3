It is found in [[Puna grassland|puna]] and [[p\u00e1ramo]] in the [[Andes]], ranging from southern [[Ecuador]], through [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], to northern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. It is generally uncommon to fairly common. It resembles the closely related [[Carunculated Caracara]] and [[White-throated Caracara]], but unlike those species, its chest is uniform black. [[Juvenile (organism)|Juveniles]] are far less distinctive than the red-faced [[piebald|pied]] adults, being overall brown with dull pinkish-grey facial skin.\n\n==Description==\nA medium-sized caracara with a faintly blue beak tip turning to bright orange, strongly contrasted by the jet-black feathers of its head, back and chest. Its rump, belly and upper tail and undertail coverts are pure white, changing sharply from black to white between the belly and chest. Its black wings have small white shoulder patches and it has white spots on some of its outer primaries.<ref>Poulsen, B. (1993) A contact zone between Mountain and Carunculated Caracaras in Ecuador.
