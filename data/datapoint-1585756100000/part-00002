[[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] said:\n\n:Everybody liked Louis Caput, who became known to the crowds as ''P'tit Louis''. And not only was Caput a likeable rider, he was a clever one who knew his job perfectly and I don't think I have ever seen him make a serious mistake on the road. Whenever he got into a break, he was the boss, the ruler of it.
