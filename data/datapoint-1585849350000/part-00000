An [[epeiric sea|epeiric]] (or \"shelf\") sea on the [[Europe]]an [[continental shelf]], it connects to the ocean through the [[English Channel]] in the south and the [[Norwegian Sea]] in the north. It is more than {{convert|970|km|mi}} long and {{convert|580|km|mi}} wide, with an area of {{convert|570000|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nThe North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major [[fishery]]. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries, and more recently the sea has developed into a rich source of energy resources, including [[fossil fuel]]s, [[wind energy|wind]], and early efforts in [[wave power]].\n\nHistorically, the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the [[Viking Age|Vikings' rise]]. Subsequently, the [[Hanseatic League]], the [[Dutch Golden Age|Netherlands]], and the [[British Empire|British]] each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus access to the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars.\n\nThe coast of the North Sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features. In the north, deep [[fjord]]s and sheer cliffs mark the [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] coastlines, whereas in the south, the coast consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide [[mudflat]]s. Due to the dense population, heavy industrialization, and intense use of the sea and area surrounding it, there have been various environmental issues affecting the sea's ecosystems. Adverse environmental issues \u2013 commonly including [[overfishing]], industrial and agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]], [[dredging]], and dumping, among others \u2013 have led to a number of efforts to prevent degradation of the sea while still making use of its economic potential.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of the North Sea}}\n{{See also|List of rivers discharging into the North Sea}}\n{{Annotated image | float=right| caption=Sk{{=}}[[Skagerrak]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ka=[[Kattegat]]<br />Eng Ch=[[English Channel]] | image=Nseamap.gif | width=240 | height=313\n|image-width=250\n|annotations=\n{{Annotation|106|142|'''North<br />Sea'''}}\n{{Annotation|81|10|'''[[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian<br />Sea]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|163|152|'''[[Skagerrak|Sk]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|188|166|'''[[Kattegat|Ka]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|24|280|'''[[English Channel|Eng Ch]]'''}}\n}}\nThe North Sea is bounded by the [[Orkney Islands]] and east coast of [[Great Britain]] to the west<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n|last = L.M.A.\n|editor = University of Chicago\n|encyclopedia =Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Macrop\u00e6dia\n|title = Europe\n|edition = Fifteenth\n|year = 1985\n|publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\n|volume =18\n|location = U.S.A.\n|isbn =978-0-85229-423-9\n|pages = 832\u2013835\n}}\n</ref> and the northern and [[central Europe]]an mainland to the east and south, including [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[France]].<ref name=\"American\">{{cite book\n|last=Ripley\n|first=George |author2=Charles Anderson Dana\n|title=The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEpMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA499\n|year=1883\n|publisher= D.

An [[epeiric sea|epeiric]] (or \"shelf\") sea on the [[Europe]]an [[continental shelf]], it connects to the ocean through the [[English Channel]] in the south and the [[Norwegian Sea]] in the north. It is more than {{convert|970|km|mi}} long and {{convert|580|km|mi}} wide, with an area of {{convert|570000|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nThe North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major [[fishery]]. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries, and more recently the sea has developed into a rich source of energy resources, including [[fossil fuel]]s, [[wind energy|wind]], and early efforts in [[wave power]].\n\nHistorically, the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the [[Viking Age|Vikings' rise]]. Subsequently, the [[Hanseatic League]], the [[Dutch Golden Age|Netherlands]], and the [[British Empire|British]] each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus access to the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars.\n\nThe coast of the North Sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features. In the north, deep [[fjord]]s and sheer cliffs mark the [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] coastlines, whereas in the south, the coast consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide [[mudflat]]s. Due to the dense population, heavy industrialization, and intense use of the sea and area surrounding it, there have been various environmental issues affecting the sea's ecosystems. Adverse environmental issues \u2013 commonly including [[overfishing]], industrial and agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]], [[dredging]], and dumping, among others \u2013 have led to a number of efforts to prevent degradation of the sea while still making use of its economic potential.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of the North Sea}}\n{{See also|List of rivers discharging into the North Sea}}\n{{Annotated image | float=right| caption=Sk{{=}}[[Skagerrak]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ka=[[Kattegat]]<br />Eng Ch=[[English Channel]] | image=Nseamap.gif | width=240 | height=313\n|image-width=250\n|annotations=\n{{Annotation|106|142|'''North<br />Sea'''}}\n{{Annotation|81|10|'''[[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian<br />Sea]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|163|152|'''[[Skagerrak|Sk]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|188|166|'''[[Kattegat|Ka]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|24|280|'''[[English Channel|Eng Ch]]'''}}\n}}\nThe North Sea is bounded by the [[Orkney Islands]] and east coast of [[Great Britain]] to the west<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n|last = L.M.A.\n|editor = University of Chicago\n|encyclopedia =Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Macrop\u00e6dia\n|title = Europe\n|edition = Fifteenth\n|year = 1985\n|publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\n|volume =18\n|location = U.S.A.\n|isbn =978-0-85229-423-9\n|pages = 832\u2013835\n}}\n</ref> and the northern and [[central Europe]]an mainland to the east and south, including [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[France]].<ref name=\"American\">{{cite book\n|last=Ripley\n|first=George |author2=Charles Anderson Dana\n|title=The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEpMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA499\n|year=1883\n|publisher= D.
