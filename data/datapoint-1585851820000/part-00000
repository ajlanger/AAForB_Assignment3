His literary output includes the semi-autobiographical, baroque novel ''[[Paradiso (1966 novel)|Paradiso]]'' (1966), the story of a young man and his struggles with his mysterious illness, the death of his father, and his developing sensuality and poetic sensibilities. Lezama Lima also edited several anthologies of Cuban poetry and the magazines ''Verbum'' and ''Or\u00edgenes'', presiding as the patriarch of Cuban letters for most of his later years.\n\nLezama Lima spent little time outside of his home country, making a trip to Mexico in 1949 and Jamaica in 1950<ref>[http://www.cubaliteraria.cu/autor/lezama_lima/cronologia.html Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima Cronolog\u00eda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811054158/http://www.cubaliteraria.cu/autor/lezama_lima/cronologia.html |date=2018-08-11 }}</ref>). Nevertheless, Lezama's poetry, essays and two novels draw images and ideas from a vast array of world cultures and historical time periods.  The Baroque style that he forged relied equally upon his [[G\u00f3ngora]]-influenced syntax and his stunning constellations of unlikely images, which often drew from Ancient Chinese and Egyptian philosophical texts and mythological narratives. Lezama Lima's first published work, the long poem \"Muerte de Narciso,\" brought him national acclaim at the age of twenty-seven and established his well-wrought style and classical subject matter.\n\nIn addition to his poems and novels, Lezama wrote many essays on figures of world literature such as [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], [[Paul Val\u00e9ry|Val\u00e9ry]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora|G\u00f3ngora]] and [[Rimbaud]] as well as on Latin American baroque aesthetics. Most notably the essays published as ''La Expresi\u00f3n Americana'' lay out his vision of the European baroque, its relation to the classical, and the American baroque.\n\nLezama Lima died in 1976 at age 65 and was buried in the [[Colon Cemetery, Havana]]. He was influential for Cuban and Puerto Rican writers of his generation and the next, such as [[Virgilio Pi\u00f1era]], [[Reinaldo Arenas]], Fernando Vel\u00e1zquez Medina, [[Ren\u00e9 Marqu\u00e9s]], and [[Giannina Braschi]], who depict his life and works in their writing.\n\n==Works==\n\n=== Poetry ===\n* ''Muerte de Narciso'' (1937) \n* ''Enemigo rumor'' (1941)\n* ''Aventuras sigilosas'' (1945)\n* ''La fijeza'' (1949)\n* ''Dador'' (1960)\n* ''Fragmentos a su im\u00e1n'' (1978)\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[Paradiso (novel)|Paradiso]]'' (1966)\n* ''Oppiano Licario'' (1977)\n\n=== Essays ===\n* ''Analecta del reloj'' (1953)\n* ''La expresi\u00f3n americana'' (1957)\n* ''Tratados en La Habana'' (1958)\n* ''La cantidad hechizada'' (1970)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Baroque New Worlds: Representation, Transculturation, Counterconquest'', ed.
