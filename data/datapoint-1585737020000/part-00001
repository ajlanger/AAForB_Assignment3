Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]].

Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]].

When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate).

Without albumins, the consistency of blood would be closer to that of water. The increased viscosity of blood prevents fluid from enterin the bloodstream from outside the capillaries.\n\nThe second most common type of protein in the blood plasma are globulins. Important globulins include immunoglobins which are important for the immune system and are transporting hormones and other compounds around the body. \n\nFibrinogen proteins makes up most of the remaining proteins in the blood.

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]].

This technique is still in practice today, almost 80 years later. In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world's first plasma donation center.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thirteen years after the center's opening, Dr. Grifols unexpectedly passed away at the young age of 41 due to leukemia. \n\n===Blood for Britain===  <!-- subject of redirect -->\nThe \"Blood for Britain\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the [[Race (human classification)|race]] of the [[blood donation|donor]].

When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate). However, plasma from UK donors is still not used for the commercial manufacture of fractionated plasma medicines.\n\n==Synthetic blood plasma==\n[[Simulated body fluid]] (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma.
