In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum.

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS).

On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum.

Smaller carriers will now be able to access T-Mobile's LTE network for roaming and T-Mobile will be able to expand roaming partnerships and extend its footprint with members whose network technologies had previously been incompatible.<ref>{{cite web|title=T-Mobile joins CCA's data roaming hub to expand reciprocal roaming deals with smaller carriers|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-joins-cca-s-data-roaming-hub-to-expand-reciprocal-roaming-deals-smaller-carriers}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, T-Mobile announced that starting November 12, 2017, LTE-speeds will be limited at 5 GB (with speeds going at speeds at 128 kbit/s or 256 kbit/s on some plans) while data roaming in Canada and Mexico still remains unlimited.

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

year of high school. But at that time, since he lacked the height, no one took notice of him. However, he had a growth spurt by the time he was in third year so he was taken into the high school basketball team of [[Don Bosco Technical College-Cebu]].\n\nHis first year with the varsity team was spent mostly on the bench. By the time he became a high school senior, he was already part of the team's rotation. At this point, he was already as tall as the team's center. His jump to college basketball suffered a minor setback when he ended his senior high school year with an injury. To keep himself competitive, he played in the intramural games at [[University of San Jose\u2013Recoletos]].\n\nHe eventually played college ball at the [[University of Cebu]] for three years.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Metropolitan Basketball Association===\nHontiveros joined the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]] in its maiden season in 1998 playing for the [[Cebu Gems]].  However, despite being a fan favorite among the Cebuano fans, his stint with the Gems was marred with chaos, as he requested to be released by the team because he wanted to finish his studies and the constant travelling to different provinces with the team prompted him to drop some of his subjects.<ref>{{ cite web |last1=Henson |first1=Joaquin |title=Dondon case to be resolved soon - Gems |url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/97839/dondon-case-be-resolved-soon-gems |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=January 29, 2000 |accessdate=November 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Philippine Basketball Association===\nThe Cebu Gems management tried to trade Hontiveros to different MBA teams. But Hontiveros' desire to play for the PBA eventually materialized as the Gems strike an agreement with [[Tanduay Rhum Masters]], who acquired Hontiveros in exchange for cash. But after Tanduay franchise was sold to the Lina Group in 2002, [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] (his favorite team) acquired him through a trade. Soon, he found himself a vital cog in the team's offensive rotation as he was quickly promoted as a starter for the team. He was a member of the two championships won by San Miguel in 2004-2005 Fiesta Conference and the 2009 Fiesta Conference.\n\nIn March 2011, he, along with Danny Seigle, Dorian Pena and Paul Artadi were shipped to Air21 for younger players [[Rabeh Al-Hussaini]], [[Nonoy Baclao]] and [[Rey Guevarra]].
