Local deposits of metal-bearing ores were difficult to process because they were low grade. The nation's large and varied forest resources, which covered 70 percent of the country in the late 1980s, were not utilized extensively. Because of political decisions on local, prefectural, and national levels, Japan decided not to exploit its forest resources for economic gain. Domestic sources only supplied between 25 and 30 percent of the nation's timber needs. Agriculture and fishing were the best developed resources, but only through years of painstaking investment and toil. The nation, therefore, built up the manufacturing and processing industries to convert raw materials imported from abroad. This strategy of economic development necessitated the establishment of a strong economic infrastructure to provide the needed energy, transportation, communications, and technological know-how.\n\nDeposits of [[gold]], [[magnesium]], and [[silver]] meet current industrial demands, but Japan is dependent on foreign sources for many of the minerals essential to modern industry. [[Iron ore]], [[copper]], [[bauxite]], and [[alumina]] must be imported, as well as many forest products.\n\nCompared to other industrialized economies, Japan is characterized by its low levels of exports relative to the size of its GDP. From the period 1970-2018, Japan was either the least or second least export-dependent economy in the [[Group of Seven|G7]], and one of the least export-dependent economies in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=US-JP-DE-GB-FR-IT-CA|title=Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) - United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> It has also been one of the least trade-dependent economies in the 1970-2018 period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?locations=US-JP-DE-GB-FR-IT-CA|title=Trade (% of GDP) - United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapan receives exceptionally low levels of foreign investment.

It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese ''\"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\"'' ([[Alessandro Valignano]], 1584, \"Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).\n\nEarly European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather rich in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron.\n\nThe cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about 4 smaller-sized ships every year) arriving in Japan almost entirely consisted of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the [[Emperor of China]], as a punishment for [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called ''Nanban'', lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.\n\n===Edo period (1603\u20131868)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n[[File:\u9d8f\u6587\u9aed\u76bf \u80a5\u524d\u713c\u30fb\u53e4\u4f0a\u4e07\u91cc\u69d8\u5f0f-Barber's Bowl with Cockerel MET DP281043 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Japanese export porcelain]] in the European shape of a barber's shaving basin bowl, with copulating cock, around 1700.]]\nThe beginning of the [[Edo period]] coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]], during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 350 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], were active throughout Asia.\n\nIn order to eradicate the influence of [[Christianization]], Japan entered in a period of isolation called [[sakoku]], during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-bakuhan-system#ref319463|title=The Bakuhan System|last=|first=|date=15 February 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century, most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was for export, mostly in [[Kyushu]]. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>     \n\nEconomic development during the Edo period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign [[commerce]], and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The [[construction]] trades flourished, along with banking facilities and [[merchant]] associations. Increasingly, [[Han (country subdivision)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and the spread of rural handicrafts.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\nRice was the base of the economy, as the daimy\u014d collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in [[Edo]]. To raise money, the daimy\u014d used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nDuring the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', literally \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired from Western techniques.\n\n===Pre-war period (1868\u20131945)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n\nSince the mid-19th century, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and Japan has gone through two periods of economic development. The first began in earnest in 1868 and extended through to World War II; the second began in 1945 and continued into the mid-1980s.\n\nEconomic developments of the [[Empire of Japan|prewar period]] began with the \"[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei|Rich State and Strong Army Policy]]\" by the [[Meiji government]]. During the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Oyatoi gaikokujin]]). The government also built railroads, improved road, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.\n\nTo promote [[industrialization]], the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the public sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Government emerged as chief promoter of [[private enterprise]], enacting a series of pro-business policies.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were \"10 times less\" than the one of the U.S (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% the one of the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fukao |first=Kyoji |title=Real GDP in Pre-War East Asia: A 1934\u201336 Benchmark Purchasing Power Parity Comparison with the US |year=2007 |url=http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/files/Fukao_Ma_Yuan.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period (1945\u2013present)===\n[[File:2005Japanese exports.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Japanese exports in 2005]]\n{{See also|Japanese post-war economic miracle|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, overall real economic growth was extremely large: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html | title = Japan: Patterns of Development | publisher = country-data.com |date=January 1994 | accessdate=28 December 2006}}</ref> By the end of said period, Japan had moved into being a high-wage economy.<ref>Business in context: an introduction to business and its environment by David Needle</ref>\n\nGrowth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]] after the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to finance large [[public works]] programs.\n\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used [[quantitative easing]] to expand the country's money supply in order to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and [[Economy of the European Union|European Union]] during the same period.<ref>Masake, Hisane.

It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful ''nemawashi'' enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.\n\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"[[The Toyota Way]]\". [[Kaizen]] ([[wikt:\u6539\u5584|\u6539\u5584]], Japanese for \"improvement\") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Imai\n | first = Masaaki\n | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success\n | location = New York, NY\n | publisher = Random House\n | year = 1986\n}}</ref> By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see [[Lean manufacturing]]). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world.<ref>Europe Japan Centre, Kaizen Strategies for Improving Team Performance, Ed. Michael Colenso, London: Pearson Education Limited, 2000</ref> Within certain value systems, it is ironic that Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life. According to the OECD, annual hours worked per employee is below the OECD average and in the middle among G7 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chart/5Stk|title=Interactive charts by the OECD|website=OECD Data|language=en|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shunt\u014d]]''.  The [[Nenko System]] or Nenko Joretsu, as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of promoting an employee based on his or her proximity to [[retirement]]. The advantage of the system is that it allows older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement and it usually brings more experience to the executive ranks. The disadvantage of the system is that it does not allow new talent to be combined with experience and those with specialized skills cannot be promoted to the already crowded executive ranks. It also does not guarantee or even attempt to bring the \"right person for the right job\".\n\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. {{Nihongo|[[Amakudari]]|\u5929\u4e0b\u308a|amakudari|\"descent from heaven\"}} is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms.  [[Lifetime employment]] (''sh\u016bshin koy\u014d'') and seniority-based career advancement have been common in the [[Japanese work environment]].<ref name=\"oecd2008\">[http://www.oecd.org/document/17/0,3343,en_2649_34111_40353553_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD: Economic survey of Japan 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109122744/http://www.oecd.org/document/17/0,3343,en_2649_34111_40353553_1_1_1_1,00.html |date=9 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=7193984 |title=Japan's Economy: Free at last |newspaper=The Economist |date=20 July 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2007}}</ref>  Japan has begun to gradually move away from some of these norms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10169956|title=Going hybrid|work=The Economist|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Salaryman]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3|''Sarar\u012bman''|salaried man}} refers to someone whose income is salary based; particularly those working for corporations. Its frequent use by Japanese corporations, and its prevalence in Japanese [[manga]] and anime has gradually led to its acceptance in English-speaking countries as a noun for a Japanese [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] businessman. The word can be found in many books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, [[wage slavery]], and [[kar\u014dshi]]. The term salaryman refers almost exclusively to males.\n\nAn [[office lady]], often abbreviated OL (Japanese: \u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb ''\u014ceru''), is a female [[office worker]] in Japan who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving tea and [[secretary|secretarial]] or [[clerk (position)|clerical]] work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often [[parasite single|live with their parents]] well into [[early adulthood]]. Office ladies are usually [[Full-time job|full-time]] permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], and there is usually the [[wikt:tacit|tacit]] expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Freeter]]|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|fur\u012bt\u0101}} is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as ''[[underemployment|underemployed]]'' or [[freelance]] workers. These people do not start a [[career]] after [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] or [[List of universities in Japan|university]] but instead usually live as [[parasite single]]s with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. The low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and the lack of qualifications makes it difficult to start a career at a later point in life.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Kar\u014dshi]]|\u904e\u52b4\u6b7b|''kar\u014dshi''}}, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as \"[[death from overwork]]\", is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of kar\u014dshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[S\u014dkaiya]]|\u7dcf\u4f1a\u5c4b|s\u014dkaiya}}, (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are a form of specialized [[racketeer]] unique to Japan, and often associated with the [[yakuza]] that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{Nihongo|annual meeting|\u7dcf\u4f1a|s\u014dkai}}.  {{Nihongo|[[Sarakin]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u91d1}} is a Japanese term for moneylender, or [[loan shark]]. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for [[salaryman]] and cash. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a ''sarakin''. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals $100 billion. The biggest ''sarakin'' are publicly traded and often allied with [[List of banks in Japan|big banks]].<ref name=\"economist\">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11413090 Lenders of first resort], ''The Economist'', 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nThe first \"Western-style\" [[department stores in Japan|department store in Japan]] was [[Mitsukoshi]], founded in 1904, which has its root as a [[kimono]] store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, [[Matsuzakaya]] has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in [[Ginza]] allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsuzakaya.co.jp/corporate/history/honshi/index.shtml |title=\u677e\u5742\u5c4b\u300c\u3072\u3068\u30fb\u3053\u3068\u30fb\u3082\u306e\u300d\u8a9e\u308a |publisher=Matsuzakaya.co.jp |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed for their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of Japanese department store is that from railway company. There have been many [[private railway]] operators in the nation, and from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' [[Terminal train station|termini]]. [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu]] and [[Hankyu Department Stores|Hankyu]] are the typical examples of this type.  From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores face fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presences. Still, ''dep\u0101to'' are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for prestigious department stores are frequently given as formal presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\n===Keiretsu===\n{{Main|Keiretsu}}\nA {{Nihongo|[[keiretsu]]|\u7cfb\u5217|extra=\"system\" or \"series\"}} is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of [[business group]]. The prototypical ''keiretsu'' appeared in Japan during the \"[[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic miracle]]\" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled [[vertical monopoly|vertical monopolies]] called ''[[zaibatsu]]''. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dismantled the ''zaibatsu'' in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the ''zaibatsu'' were reintegrated.  The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, ''keiretsu'' companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well.  In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/17/archives/japan-again-plans-huge-corporations.html?sq=ogasawara&scp=46&st=p  \"Japan Again Plans Huge Corporations,\"] ''New York Times.'' 17 July 1954.</ref>\n\nThe major ''keiretsu'' were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the ''keiretsu's'' member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the ''keiretsu'' and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of [[hostile takeover]]s in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\n\nThere are two types of ''keiretsu'': vertical and horizontal. Vertical ''keiretsu'' illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal ''keiretsu'' shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.\n\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the keiretsu: [[Sumitomo Bank]] and [[Mitsui]] Bank, for instance, became [[Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation]] in 2001, while [[Sanwa Bank]] (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]]. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as [[Sony]], began outperforming their counterparts within the system.\n\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old keiretsu system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of keiretsu alliances. While the keiretsu still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing [[corporate acquisition]] industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising [[derivative litigation]] by more independent shareholders.\n\n== Mergers and Acquisitions ==\nJapanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018. This cumulates to a total value of 2,636 bil. USD which translates to 281,469.9 bil.

Local deposits of metal-bearing ores were difficult to process because they were low grade. The nation's large and varied forest resources, which covered 70 percent of the country in the late 1980s, were not utilized extensively. Because of political decisions on local, prefectural, and national levels, Japan decided not to exploit its forest resources for economic gain. Domestic sources only supplied between 25 and 30 percent of the nation's timber needs. Agriculture and fishing were the best developed resources, but only through years of painstaking investment and toil. The nation, therefore, built up the manufacturing and processing industries to convert raw materials imported from abroad. This strategy of economic development necessitated the establishment of a strong economic infrastructure to provide the needed energy, transportation, communications, and technological know-how.\n\nDeposits of [[gold]], [[magnesium]], and [[silver]] meet current industrial demands, but Japan is dependent on foreign sources for many of the minerals essential to modern industry. [[Iron ore]], [[copper]], [[bauxite]], and [[alumina]] must be imported, as well as many forest products.\n\nCompared to other industrialized economies, Japan is characterized by its low levels of exports relative to the size of its GDP. From the period 1970-2018, Japan was either the least or second least export-dependent economy in the [[Group of Seven|G7]], and one of the least export-dependent economies in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=US-JP-DE-GB-FR-IT-CA|title=Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) - United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> It has also been one of the least trade-dependent economies in the 1970-2018 period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?locations=US-JP-DE-GB-FR-IT-CA|title=Trade (% of GDP) - United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapan receives exceptionally low levels of foreign investment.

It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese ''\"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\"'' ([[Alessandro Valignano]], 1584, \"Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).\n\nEarly European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather rich in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron.\n\nThe cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about 4 smaller-sized ships every year) arriving in Japan almost entirely consisted of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the [[Emperor of China]], as a punishment for [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called ''Nanban'', lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.\n\n===Edo period (1603\u20131868)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n[[File:\u9d8f\u6587\u9aed\u76bf \u80a5\u524d\u713c\u30fb\u53e4\u4f0a\u4e07\u91cc\u69d8\u5f0f-Barber's Bowl with Cockerel MET DP281043 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Japanese export porcelain]] in the European shape of a barber's shaving basin bowl, with copulating cock, around 1700.]]\nThe beginning of the [[Edo period]] coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]], during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 350 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], were active throughout Asia.\n\nIn order to eradicate the influence of [[Christianization]], Japan entered in a period of isolation called [[sakoku]], during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-bakuhan-system#ref319463|title=The Bakuhan System|last=|first=|date=15 February 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century, most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was for export, mostly in [[Kyushu]]. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>     \n\nEconomic development during the Edo period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign [[commerce]], and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The [[construction]] trades flourished, along with banking facilities and [[merchant]] associations. Increasingly, [[Han (country subdivision)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and the spread of rural handicrafts.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\nRice was the base of the economy, as the daimy\u014d collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in [[Edo]]. To raise money, the daimy\u014d used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nDuring the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', literally \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired from Western techniques.\n\n===Pre-war period (1868\u20131945)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n\nSince the mid-19th century, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and Japan has gone through two periods of economic development. The first began in earnest in 1868 and extended through to World War II; the second began in 1945 and continued into the mid-1980s.\n\nEconomic developments of the [[Empire of Japan|prewar period]] began with the \"[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei|Rich State and Strong Army Policy]]\" by the [[Meiji government]]. During the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Oyatoi gaikokujin]]). The government also built railroads, improved road, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.\n\nTo promote [[industrialization]], the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the public sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Government emerged as chief promoter of [[private enterprise]], enacting a series of pro-business policies.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were \"10 times less\" than the one of the U.S (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% the one of the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fukao |first=Kyoji |title=Real GDP in Pre-War East Asia: A 1934\u201336 Benchmark Purchasing Power Parity Comparison with the US |year=2007 |url=http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/files/Fukao_Ma_Yuan.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period (1945\u2013present)===\n[[File:2005Japanese exports.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Japanese exports in 2005]]\n{{See also|Japanese post-war economic miracle|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, overall real economic growth was extremely large: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html | title = Japan: Patterns of Development | publisher = country-data.com |date=January 1994 | accessdate=28 December 2006}}</ref> By the end of said period, Japan had moved into being a high-wage economy.<ref>Business in context: an introduction to business and its environment by David Needle</ref>\n\nGrowth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]] after the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to finance large [[public works]] programs.\n\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used [[quantitative easing]] to expand the country's money supply in order to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and [[Economy of the European Union|European Union]] during the same period.<ref>Masake, Hisane.

It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful ''nemawashi'' enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.\n\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"[[The Toyota Way]]\". [[Kaizen]] ([[wikt:\u6539\u5584|\u6539\u5584]], Japanese for \"improvement\") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Imai\n | first = Masaaki\n | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success\n | location = New York, NY\n | publisher = Random House\n | year = 1986\n}}</ref> By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see [[Lean manufacturing]]). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world.<ref>Europe Japan Centre, Kaizen Strategies for Improving Team Performance, Ed. Michael Colenso, London: Pearson Education Limited, 2000</ref> Within certain value systems, it is ironic that Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life. According to the OECD, annual hours worked per employee is below the OECD average and in the middle among G7 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chart/5Stk|title=Interactive charts by the OECD|website=OECD Data|language=en|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shunt\u014d]]''.  The [[Nenko System]] or Nenko Joretsu, as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of promoting an employee based on his or her proximity to [[retirement]]. The advantage of the system is that it allows older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement and it usually brings more experience to the executive ranks. The disadvantage of the system is that it does not allow new talent to be combined with experience and those with specialized skills cannot be promoted to the already crowded executive ranks. It also does not guarantee or even attempt to bring the \"right person for the right job\".\n\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. {{Nihongo|[[Amakudari]]|\u5929\u4e0b\u308a|amakudari|\"descent from heaven\"}} is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms.  [[Lifetime employment]] (''sh\u016bshin koy\u014d'') and seniority-based career advancement have been common in the [[Japanese work environment]].<ref name=\"oecd2008\">[http://www.oecd.org/document/17/0,3343,en_2649_34111_40353553_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD: Economic survey of Japan 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109122744/http://www.oecd.org/document/17/0,3343,en_2649_34111_40353553_1_1_1_1,00.html |date=9 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=7193984 |title=Japan's Economy: Free at last |newspaper=The Economist |date=20 July 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2007}}</ref>  Japan has begun to gradually move away from some of these norms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10169956|title=Going hybrid|work=The Economist|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Salaryman]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3|''Sarar\u012bman''|salaried man}} refers to someone whose income is salary based; particularly those working for corporations. Its frequent use by Japanese corporations, and its prevalence in Japanese [[manga]] and anime has gradually led to its acceptance in English-speaking countries as a noun for a Japanese [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] businessman. The word can be found in many books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, [[wage slavery]], and [[kar\u014dshi]]. The term salaryman refers almost exclusively to males.\n\nAn [[office lady]], often abbreviated OL (Japanese: \u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb ''\u014ceru''), is a female [[office worker]] in Japan who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving tea and [[secretary|secretarial]] or [[clerk (position)|clerical]] work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often [[parasite single|live with their parents]] well into [[early adulthood]]. Office ladies are usually [[Full-time job|full-time]] permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], and there is usually the [[wikt:tacit|tacit]] expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Freeter]]|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|fur\u012bt\u0101}} is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as ''[[underemployment|underemployed]]'' or [[freelance]] workers. These people do not start a [[career]] after [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] or [[List of universities in Japan|university]] but instead usually live as [[parasite single]]s with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. The low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and the lack of qualifications makes it difficult to start a career at a later point in life.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Kar\u014dshi]]|\u904e\u52b4\u6b7b|''kar\u014dshi''}}, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as \"[[death from overwork]]\", is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of kar\u014dshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[S\u014dkaiya]]|\u7dcf\u4f1a\u5c4b|s\u014dkaiya}}, (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are a form of specialized [[racketeer]] unique to Japan, and often associated with the [[yakuza]] that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{Nihongo|annual meeting|\u7dcf\u4f1a|s\u014dkai}}.  {{Nihongo|[[Sarakin]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u91d1}} is a Japanese term for moneylender, or [[loan shark]]. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for [[salaryman]] and cash. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a ''sarakin''. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals $100 billion. The biggest ''sarakin'' are publicly traded and often allied with [[List of banks in Japan|big banks]].<ref name=\"economist\">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11413090 Lenders of first resort], ''The Economist'', 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nThe first \"Western-style\" [[department stores in Japan|department store in Japan]] was [[Mitsukoshi]], founded in 1904, which has its root as a [[kimono]] store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, [[Matsuzakaya]] has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in [[Ginza]] allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsuzakaya.co.jp/corporate/history/honshi/index.shtml |title=\u677e\u5742\u5c4b\u300c\u3072\u3068\u30fb\u3053\u3068\u30fb\u3082\u306e\u300d\u8a9e\u308a |publisher=Matsuzakaya.co.jp |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed for their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of Japanese department store is that from railway company. There have been many [[private railway]] operators in the nation, and from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' [[Terminal train station|termini]]. [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu]] and [[Hankyu Department Stores|Hankyu]] are the typical examples of this type.  From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores face fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presences. Still, ''dep\u0101to'' are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for prestigious department stores are frequently given as formal presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\n===Keiretsu===\n{{Main|Keiretsu}}\nA {{Nihongo|[[keiretsu]]|\u7cfb\u5217|extra=\"system\" or \"series\"}} is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of [[business group]]. The prototypical ''keiretsu'' appeared in Japan during the \"[[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic miracle]]\" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled [[vertical monopoly|vertical monopolies]] called ''[[zaibatsu]]''. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dismantled the ''zaibatsu'' in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the ''zaibatsu'' were reintegrated.  The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, ''keiretsu'' companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well.  In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/17/archives/japan-again-plans-huge-corporations.html?sq=ogasawara&scp=46&st=p  \"Japan Again Plans Huge Corporations,\"] ''New York Times.'' 17 July 1954.</ref>\n\nThe major ''keiretsu'' were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the ''keiretsu's'' member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the ''keiretsu'' and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of [[hostile takeover]]s in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\n\nThere are two types of ''keiretsu'': vertical and horizontal. Vertical ''keiretsu'' illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal ''keiretsu'' shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.\n\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the keiretsu: [[Sumitomo Bank]] and [[Mitsui]] Bank, for instance, became [[Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation]] in 2001, while [[Sanwa Bank]] (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]]. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as [[Sony]], began outperforming their counterparts within the system.\n\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old keiretsu system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of keiretsu alliances. While the keiretsu still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing [[corporate acquisition]] industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising [[derivative litigation]] by more independent shareholders.\n\n== Mergers and Acquisitions ==\nJapanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018. This cumulates to a total value of 2,636 bil. USD which translates to 281,469.9 bil.
