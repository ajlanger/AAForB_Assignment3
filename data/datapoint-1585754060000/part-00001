The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] is assigned to the [[920th Rescue Wing]] at [[Patrick Air Force Base]], Florida.\n\n==Mission==\nThe peacetime mission of the 308th is to train and maintain rescue capability for [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] personnel, humanitarian and disaster relief activities.  The 308th's wartime mission is to provide combat rescue capabilities to recover downed aircrew members and isolated personnel. They can provide this capability under the harshest of circumstances to include, day/night, inclement weather and all terrain rescue conditions.<ref name=308RSfacts/>\n\nThe squadron consists of [[United States Air Force Combat Rescue Officer|Combat Rescue Officers]] and enlisted [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]], the latter known as PJs.  While many CROs and PJs enter the 920th from the active duty Air Force, others are accessed directly into the Air Force Reserve.  CRO and PJ Candidates must pass a physical assessment test which has about 15% success rate. An average of eighty people Air Force-wide enter the 2-year CRO / PJ training program each year.<ref>{{Cite news | first=R.

For that mission, the squadron will have 3 teams ready.\n\nDuring ascent for Starliner, Dragon, and Orion, the 304th Rescue Squadron will have two teams stationed along the east coast of the United States, one at Patrick Air Force Base (just South of the Cape) and the other in Charleston, South Carolina. The Patrick team, Rescue 1, will be responsible for on-pad aborts that place a capsule in the water or for aborts in the first couple minutes of flight that place the capsule within a 200 nautical mile zone from the Cape. After that distance is exceeded, the Charleston crew (Rescue 2) would be responsible for rescue of a launch-aborting crew vehicle anywhere else across the Atlantic.The third team, stationed in Hawai\u2019i, (also part of Rescue 2) would be responsible for any after-launch immediate landing need or off-nominal Station return contingency that places a Starliner or Dragon in the Pacific. If an off-nominal from orbit return occurred with splashdown in the Atlantic, an emergency ocean return within 200 nautical miles of Cape Canaveral would fall to Rescue 1. Any other Atlantic splashdown would fall to Rescue 2 from Charleston because they have more powerful aircraft that could reach Starliner or Dragon or Orion quicker than the Patrick support craft.\n\nRescue 1 carries a requirement to have a crew en route back to land within 6 hours of splashdown. Rescue 2 carries a requirement to have the hatch on a capsule opened within 24 hours of splashdown and a crew evacuated (via helicopter or ship) from the sea landing area within 72 hours of hatch open.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/04/dod-starliner-sea-recovery-first-time/|title=DoD practices Starliner at sea recovery for first time \u2013 NASASpaceFlight.com|language=en-US|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref> The role ended in July 2011 when NASA's human spaceflight transportation system ended.<ref name=308RSfacts/>\n[[File:...Set...
