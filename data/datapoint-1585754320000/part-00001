Bell, president of sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007.  He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was \"a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor.\"  He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip&nbsp;\u2014 an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time&nbsp;\u2014another indication that \"something (was) going on.\"  However, Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertstatsdonaghy | title = Numbers indicate unlikely outcomes in games Donaghy officiated | publisher = ESPN.com | author = Wayne Drehs | date = July 24, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHandicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a \"rogue official\". According to Lang, an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future.  Lang also believed a [[bookie]] connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertexplainsNBAbets | title = Expert explains the many ways a crooked referee could fix bets | publisher = ESPN.com | author = Wayne Drehs | date = July 23, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the betting scandal, Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with [[sportsbook]]s. In addition, almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that \"[the] ban on gambling is absolute, and in my view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years\". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting\u2014though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling  on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.<ref name=\"ESPN_refrulechanges\">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3079309|title=NBA to revamp ref gambling rules; Jackson, Nunn see roles reduced|last=Sheridan|first=Chris|date=October 26, 2007|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*\"[[Burn Card]]\"\n*[[Inside Game|''Inside Game'' (2019 film)]]\n*[[National Basketball Association controversies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714013750/http://conversations.psu.edu/episodes/sean_patrick_griffin Author Sean Patrick Griffin discusses book, ''Gaming the Game: The Story Behind the NBA Betting Scandal and the Gambler Who Made It Happen'' on ''Conversations from Penn State''].\n\n{{Sports Corruption Scandals}}\n{{NBA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:betting scandal}}\n[[Category:National Basketball Association controversies]]\n[[Category:2005\u201306 NBA season]]\n[[Category:2006\u201307 NBA season]]\n[[Category:Sports betting scandals|NBA]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n[[File:TimDonaghyMugshot.81.jpg|thumb|200px|Tim Donaghy]]\nThe '''2007 NBA betting scandal''' was a scandal involving the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and accusations that an NBA referee used his knowledge of relationships between referees, coaches, players and owners to bet on professional basketball games.

Bell, president of sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007.  He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was \"a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor.\"  He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip&nbsp;\u2014 an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time&nbsp;\u2014another indication that \"something (was) going on.\"  However, Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertstatsdonaghy | title = Numbers indicate unlikely outcomes in games Donaghy officiated | publisher = ESPN.com | author = Wayne Drehs | date = July 24, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHandicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a \"rogue official\". According to Lang, an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future.  Lang also believed a [[bookie]] connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertexplainsNBAbets | title = Expert explains the many ways a crooked referee could fix bets | publisher = ESPN.com | author = Wayne Drehs | date = July 23, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the betting scandal, Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with [[sportsbook]]s. In addition, almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that \"[the] ban on gambling is absolute, and in my view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years\". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting\u2014though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling  on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.<ref name=\"ESPN_refrulechanges\">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3079309|title=NBA to revamp ref gambling rules; Jackson, Nunn see roles reduced|last=Sheridan|first=Chris|date=October 26, 2007|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*\"[[Burn Card]]\"\n*[[Inside Game|''Inside Game'' (2019 film)]]\n*[[National Basketball Association controversies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714013750/http://conversations.psu.edu/episodes/sean_patrick_griffin Author Sean Patrick Griffin discusses book, ''Gaming the Game: The Story Behind the NBA Betting Scandal and the Gambler Who Made It Happen'' on ''Conversations from Penn State''].\n\n{{Sports Corruption Scandals}}\n{{NBA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:betting scandal}}\n[[Category:National Basketball Association controversies]]\n[[Category:2005\u201306 NBA season]]\n[[Category:2006\u201307 NBA season]]\n[[Category:Sports betting scandals|NBA]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:5a24:1a00:a181:15fa:8dd8:de0a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSentencing)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal"}
