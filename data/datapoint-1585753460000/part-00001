The band took their name from the famous [[Beatles]] record ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' released in 1965. Their first album, ''[[The Rubber Soul Project (album)|The Rubber Soul Project]]'', released in 1996, was conceived as an imaginary [[Beatles]] album, with the band writing music and lyrics to songs for which they had heard only the titles. Their second album, ''The Rubber Soul Project 2'', also inspired by the music and the titles of never-before-heard Beatles songs, was released in 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project''===\nThe band history begins in 1993 in [[Belgrade]], when visual artist [[Rastko \u0106iri\u0107]], professor of Illustration and Animation at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade Faculty of Applied Arts]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] writer Goran Skrobonja bonded over their mutual love for the Beatles.<ref name=\"vreme1270\">[http://www.vreme.rs/cms/view.php?id=1295363 \"INTERVJU \u2013 RASTKO \u0106IRI\u0106, PROFESOR, MUZI\u010cAR I AUTOR RUBBER SOUL PROJECTA: Izma\u0161tavanje Bitlsa\", vreme.rs]</ref> Inspired by the titles of songs the Beatles never released (some of which were available on [[bootleg recording]]s in [[Western Europe]], but not in Serbia) they found in Jeff Russel's book ''The Beatles \u2013 Album files and Complete Discography'', the two set out to write lyrics and music in the manner in which the Beatles would have done it.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The lyrics were written by Skrobonja, and the music was written by \u0106iri\u0107.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The two then decided to record the album with their songs.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> In 1995, the band, named The Rubber Soul Project (in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Beatles ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album), was formed. It consisted of \u0106iri\u0107, Neboj\u0161a Ignjatovi\u0107, musician and professor of [[double bass]] at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade Music Academy]], Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107, bass guitarist of the popular Serbian band [[Bajaga i Instruktori]], and \u010cedomir Macura, the drummer of Bajaga i Instruktori.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nThe album ''[[The Rubber Soul Project (album)|The Rubber Soul Project]]'' was recorded from December 1994 to March 1995. On the album recording \u0106iri\u0107 sang and played [[acoustic guitar]], [[piano]], [[soprano recorder]], [[tambourine]], [[maracas]], [[kazoo]]s, [[jingle bell]]s and [[xylophone]], Ignjatovi\u0107 sang and played [[electric guitar]], [[twelve-string guitar]], acoustic guitar, piano, tambourine, [[cabassa]], [[synthesizer]] and [[flute]], Cvetkovi\u0107 played [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner 500/1 violin bass]], tambourine, electric guitar, [[keyboard bass]], maracas, [[slide guitar]] and sang backing vocals, and Macura played [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and did lead vocals on the track \"When I Come To Town\", the \"[[Ringo Starr]] song\" of the album. The album was produced by Ignjatovi\u0107 and Cvetkovi\u0107, the latter also being the recording engineer. The goal of the band members was to produce the authentic Beatles sound and atmosphere. Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107 played the H\u00f6fner 500/1 violin bass, the same type [[Paul McCartney]] used, and Macura played on the [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig]] drum set, the type Ringo Starr played on all Beatles records. The album included a [[sitar]] [[George Harrison]]-style track called \"Indian Rope Trick\", [[rock and roll]] songs \"Home\", \"When I Come To Town\", and \"Bound By Love\", [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] \"Colliding Circles\", \"Watching Rainbows\", and \"Rubber Soul\".<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, record label [[PGP-RTS]] released the album on vinyl (circulation of less than 200 copies, exclusively for radio stations) and [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]]. The album was met by positive reactions from both the audience and the critics. In April 1996, an article about the project was published in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. Several videos were recorded for the songs from the album. The video for the song \"Colliding Circles\", directed by Sr\u0111an Markovi\u0107 and Jelena Obradovi\u0107, was awarded the Golden Plaque and the video for the song \"Rubber Soul\", directed by Aleksandar Devi\u0107, was awarded the Best Debut Award at the 1998 Belgrade Festival of Short and Documentary film.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nAs the authors of the album were unhappy with the fact that they never received any information from PGP-RTS about the number of sold copies, let alone an agreed percentage of the sales, the project was offered to other local publishers in attempt to publish the album on [[compact disc]], but none of them showed interest. Finally, after the three-year contract expired in 1998, the authors agreed to print the CD as their private issue in limited circulation, which appeared in sales at the beginning of 1999.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The CD edition package featured a [[novella]] entitled ''Rubber Soul'', originally written by Skrobonja in 1993. The novella was written as a combination of fiction and facts, with the projection of some twenty years in the future. It was illustrated with \"documents\" created by Rastko \u0106iri\u0107. In 1994, the novella was proclaimed the best science fiction story in [[FR Yugoslavia]].\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project'' documentary===\nThe idea to create some kind of film about the Rubber Soul Project was present from the very beginnings of the project in 1993. In 1999, the authors discussed the first version of the script for a documentary movie about Rubber Soul Project with movie director Dinko Tucakovi\u0107 and screenwriter Sr\u0111an Koljevi\u0107. From 2000 until 2004 they actively worked on the film. The documentary, entitled simply ''The Rubber Soul Project'', was released in 2004. The film described the circumstances among which the whole idea of recording the album came, the recording process, interviews with the band members and some of the associates of the band members. It premiered at the [[Montpellier]] Film Festival, and was later screened on festivals in Belgrade, [[Rotterdam]], [[Reykjav\u00edk]], and other cities.\n\nThe documentary stated that a copy of the album was sent to Paul McCartney, who said he enjoyed listening to it.\n\n===Live performances===\nThe band who joined Rastko \u0106iri\u0107 to perform the Rubber Soul Project songs live did not feature the musicians which recorded the album. At concerts were the musicians from the band Fathers & Sons: Boi\u017edar Skipi\u0107 (lead guitar, vocal), Branimir Kosar (keyboards), Nedeljko Kusi\u0107 (bass guitar) and Nikola \u0110oki\u0107 (drums), as well as Maja Klisinski (percussion). In 1999, they started a series of concerts, which was stopped by the [[NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia]]. Before the beginning of the bombing, the band held concerts at the British Council Cultural Centre (16 March), the Center for Cultural Decontamination (on 19 March), Hemingway Club (on 21 March) and the Museum of Yugoslav Kinotheque (on 23 March).\n\nOn 21 April 2001, in [[Museum of Applied Arts, Belgrade|Belgrade Museum of Applied Arts]], the original Rubber Soul Project lineup, with the addition of Branko Kosar and Maja Klisinski, performed songs from the album.\n\nIn December 2005, \u0106iri\u0107 and Skrobonja were invited to by Liverpool Beatles Fan Club to unveil a plaque to [[John Lennon]] on the wall of Lennon Studios, formerly [[Liverpool]] Maternity Hospital (in which Lennon was born).<ref name=\"vreme780\">[http://www.vreme.rs/cms/view.php?id=436968 \"INTERVJU -

song)|Julia]]\", and the Rubber Soul Project in the original lineup performed their song \"This Is Not Here\".<ref name=\"vreme780\"/> On the evening of the same day, the band performed the songs from the album in Liverpool's [[The Cavern Club]], in which the Beatles performed in their early days.<ref name=\"vreme780\"/>\n\nBesides performances in Serbia and Great Britain, the band also performed in [[Italy]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project 2''===\nAfter the success of the debut album, \u0106iri\u0107 and Skrobonja began working on new tracks, writing more than 20 new songs.<ref name=\"vreme1270\" /> However, the idea was put on hiatus, before, in 2015, comic book artist [[Igor Kordej]] persuaded the two to record the follow-up to the 1996 album, even deciding to finance the recording sessions himself.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> Besides \u0106iri\u0107, Ignjatovi\u0107, Cvetkovi\u0107 and Macura, the album recording featured Damjan Da\u0161i\u0107 and Marko \u0106ali\u0107, members of the Beatles tribute band The Bestbeat.<ref

featured numerous guests, including Bajaga i Instruktori keyboardist Sa\u0161a Lokner and keyboardist and producer \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107.<ref name=\"blic\"/> Serbian director and author of British origin [[Timothy John Byford]] directed \u0106iri\u0107 in pronunciation.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The new album was released by Paladin as a box set, featuring a disc with 17 new songs, a disc with the songs from the previous album, a DVD with Dinko Tucakovi\u0107's documentary, and a book by Skrobonja entitled ''Putovanje'' (''Journey''), which describes the history of the project.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The box set cover was designed by Igor Kordej.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nAs it was the case with the previous release, the songs on the album ''The Rubber Soul Project 2'' were stylistically diverse: the song \"Zero Is Just Another Even Number\" was [[blues]]-oriented, Harrison-style \"India\" featured sitar, the song \"In the Old Hillbilly Way\" was [[rockabilly]]-oriented, and the song \"Hitch Hike\" was the \"Ringo Starr song\" sung by Macura.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The song \"India\" featured a [[parrot]] trained to pronounce the line \"Let's take a trip to India\" specially for the album recording.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The album featured two bonus songs, \"Belgrade 2020\", dedicated to Belgrade's attempt to become the 2020 [[European Capital of Culture]], and the song \"Knight of Hearts\", dedicated to Igor Kordej.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nIn 2015, \u0106iri\u0107 announced that the two albums would be released as a double [[vinyl record|vinyl]] album.<ref>[http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/326849/Nasi-muzicari-kompletiraju-Bitlse \"\u041d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0438
