The county board is also responsible for the Armagh inter-county teams.\n\n==Kits, colours and crest==\nArmagh's county colours are Orange and White. Originally they wore black and amber striped shirts until 1926 when [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nuns from [[Omeath]], in [[County Louth]] knitted the team a pair of Orange and White kits ahead of a Junior clash with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] which they have kept since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/gaa/6-counties-who-have-changed-their-gaa-kit-colours-and-the-reasons-why/333654|title=6 Counties Who Have Changed Their GAA Kit Colours And The Reasons Why|first=Conor|last=Neville|date=|website=balls.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Gaelic football==\n[[File:Liam Bradley & Peter McDonnell.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Previous Armagh senior football manager Peter McDonnell (right) with [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] manager [[Liam Bradley]] (left) at the launch of the [[2009 Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\n\n===History===\nArmagh has a long tradition of football. Several clubs were already in existence before the formation of the County Board in 1889.<ref>[http://www.newrymemoirs.com/stories_pages/relandpolsplitgaa_1.html Newry Memoirs] feature on GAA</ref> \n\nArmagh became only the second team to win the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] in 1890. In the early years of the GAA, a club that won its county championship went on to represent the county and would also wear the county colours. [[Armagh Harps GFC|Armagh Harps]] represented Armagh in the Ulster final, beating Tyrone (Cookstown's [[Cookstown Fr. Rock's GAC|Owen Roes]]), but losing to All-Ireland Champions Cork ([[Midleton GAA|Midleton]]) in the All-Ireland Semi-Final.\n\nDespite early success at provincial level, national success at junior and minor level and All-Ireland final appearances in 1953 and 1977, it took until 2002 for Armagh to win their first and only [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] under manager [[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]]. The county won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, in 1949 and again in 2009, but lost the 1957 All-Ireland Minor final to Meath.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2009 campaign which resulted in Armagh being defeated by Tyrone, Peter McDonnell stepped down as Armagh manager. He was replaced by [[Paddy O'Rourke (Down footballer)|Paddy O'Rourke]], who is from the neighbouring county of [[Down GAA|Down]]. Paddy O'Rourke was replaced by Paul Grimley who managed Armagh for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. In 2015 [[Kieran McGeeney]] took over as manager in a five year contract that was extended by a year in 2019 to 2020.\n\n===The Two Brian's Era (1995 - 2001)===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !!! style=\"background:orange\"| Total\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Played''' || 38 || 13 || 5 || 56\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Won''' || 18 || 7 || 2 || 27\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Percentage Won''' || 47.37% || 53.85% || 40.00% || 48.22%\n|}\n\n===Joe Kernan's Golden Era (2002 - 2006) ===\n\n[[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]] is widely regarded as Armagh's most successful manager having won one League title, four Ulster Championships and one All Ireland Championship.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !! style=\"background:orange\"|Total\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Played''' || 38 || 18 || 14 || 70\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Won''' || 23 || 14 || 10 || 47\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Percentage Won''' || 60.53% || 77.77% || 71.43% || 67.14%\n|}\n\n===Peter McDonnell Era (2007 - 2009)===\nPeter McDonnell was appointed Armagh managed for the 2007-2009 seasons.

In his first season as Armagh manager, McGeeney secured promotion to division 2 of the National Football League and beating [[Fermanagh]] in the final - this would be his first of two division 3 NFL titles. In his first Ulster championship as manager, Armagh were defeated by [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] on a scoreline of 0-8 to 2-11. Armagh's championship continued through the qualifiers where they managed a single win over [[Wicklow]] before being defeated by [[Galway]] in round 2. \n\nThe 2016 NFL campaign ended with four teams finishing on the same points but by virtue of having a poor scoring difference Armagh were relegated to division 3. In the 2016 Ulster championship, Armagh were suffered a defeat at the hands of [[Cavan]] forcing Armagh to continue their championship through the backdoor which resulted in a  defeat to [[Laois]] in round 1. \n\nArmagh's 2017 NFL campaign ended with [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] beating Armagh in the last league game, this defeat resulted in Armagh missing out on promotion back to division 2. In the Ulster championship Armagh went out at the hands of [[Down GAA|Down]]. However, Armagh recovered with wins over [[Fermanagh]], [[Westmeath]], [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] and [[Kildare]] to book a place in the All Ireland quarter finals where they were defeated by rivals [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]]. \n\nArmagh started the 2018 season with promotion to division 2 but their Ulster championship ended with a loss to [[Fermanagh]] in the quarter final. Armagh continued their championship in round 1 of the qualifiers where they beat [[Westmeath]], [[Sligo]] and [[Clare GAA]] but were unable to overcome Connacht finalists [[Roscommon]]. \n\nThe 2019 campaign started off with Armagh securing their division 2 status with two wins and two draws. Armagh's 2019 Ulster championships started of with a quarter final win against rivals [[Down GAA|Down]] which would be Kieran McGeeney's first win in Ulster as manager of Armagh. [[Cavan]] and Armagh were inseparable in the first game but [[Cavan]] took the victory in the replay. In the qualifiers Armagh were pitted against [[Monaghan]] winning the game 2-17 to 1-12. In round 3 of the qualifiers Armagh were drawn against [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] who would eventually defeat the Orchard county by a single point. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !! style=\"background:orange\"|Total\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Played''' || 40 || 6 || 14 || 61\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Won''' || 23 || 1 || 9 || 34\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|'''Percentage won''' || 57.5% || 16.66% || 64.29% || 55.74%\n|}[As of 8th March 2020]\n\n===Armagh GAA Football Clubs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, in recent years the county hurlers have shown a marked improvement under the guidance of manager Mattie Lennon and his assistant Ger Rogan.\n\nIn 2006 Armagh won the NHL Division 3 championship, winning all their games in the group stages before beating Louth 3-10 to 1-11 in the final at Breffni Park in Cavan. The step up to Division 2 proved to be a difficult one for the men from the Orchard County. While the team failed to win any of their group games they were unfortunate to lose to Meath and also managed to come within a point of the 2006 [[Christy Ring Cup]] finalists Carlow. Heavier defeats were suffered at the hands of more established counties such as Derry and Laois.\n\nArmagh returned to the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] in May 2007 for the first time in almost 60 years with a match against Derry. Despite putting in a strong performance the team lost out on the chance of a semi-final encounter with neighbours Down to an injury-time score.\n\nThe advances made in the county over the past two years placed them as favourites in the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] encounter on August 12 against Roscommon; however they lost this game by two points.\n\nIn 2010, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup, beating London on a scoreline of 3-15 to 3-14 on 3 July in Croke Park. The Minor team won the Ulster Minor Hurling League Division One title and reached the Ulster Minor Hurling Championship Final. The Under 21 team also reached the Ulster U21 Championship Final.\n\nIn 2011 the senior side reached the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] final for the first time since 1946 and made it to the [[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]] final for the second year in a row for the first time in their history.\nArmagh then won Division 2B in 2016 earning promotion to Division 2A. They were then subsequently relegated.\nThey then beat Down in the Ulster Hurling championship semi final giving them a place in the final where they were beaten. They beat Down in the 2017 ulster hurling semi final and are in the final.\nThey were beaten in the 2016 Nicky Rackard cup by Mayo on a score line of 2-16 to 1-15.\n\nIn 2012, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup for the second time, beating Louth 3-20 to 1-15 on 9 June in Croke Park.\n\n===Honours===\n*'''[[Nicky Rackard Cup]]s:''' ''2''\n**2010, 2012\n*'''[[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''3''\n**1978, 1979, 2000\n*'''[[National Hurling League]]s:''' 1\n**Division 3 Champions 2006\n** Division 2B Champions 2016\n*'''[[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[Ulster Minor Hurling Championship]]s:''' 1\n**1975\nUlster Minor Hurling League Division One Winners: 2010\n*'''[[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]]s:''' 6\n**1949, 1965, 1973, 1990, 1991, 2000\n\n==Camogie==\n\n===History===\nThe high point in Armagh's [[camogie]] history was an appearance in the [[National Camogie League]] final of [[National Camogie League 1995|1995]] against Cork, beating Galway and Wexford's first teams en route to the final.

The bulk of that team had emerged from an under-16 squad who reached the [[All-Ireland Minor Camogie Championship|All Ireland final]] of 1988.\n\nArmagh won Division 2 of the National Camogie League four times, [[National Camogie League 1980|1980]], [[National Camogie League 1988|1988]], [[National Camogie League 1993|1993]] and [[National Camogie League 1994|1994]], and the [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship#Nancy Murray Cup|Nancy Murray Cup]] in 2006.<ref name=\"auto\">2006 Jun A Armagh 0-7 Laois 0-1 in Drogheda scorers in [http://www.independent.ie/sport/for-the-record-135362.html Irish Independent]</ref> Armagh qualified for the [[All-Ireland Minor Camogie Championship#All Ireland Minor B Finals|All Ireland Minor B final]] of 2003<ref>2003 minor b Waterford 6-11 Armagh 1-4 report in [https://archive.is/20120801232455/http://www.independent.ie/sport/camogie-cork-minors-make-it-three-on-trot-207561.html Irish Independent]</ref> and won the Minor C championship in 2011.<ref name=\"camogie.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/1781/Murphy-goal-snatches-title-for-Armagh/Default.aspx|title=Minor C final Armagh 3-5 Meath 1-10 report on camogie.ie|author=|date=|website=camogie.ie}}</ref>\n\n[[Crossmaglen Rangers GAC|Crossmaglen]] won the 2005 [[All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship#All Ireland Junior Club Camogie Finals|All Ireland junior club title]].<ref>2003 Junior Crossmaglen 2-5 Drumcullen 0-6 report in [https://archive.is/20120909145710/http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/camogie-nash-goal-helps-granagh-to-glory-194657.html Irish Independent]</ref> Keady L\u00e1mh Dhearg qualified for the finals in 2006 and 2007.<ref>2006 junior club final Harps 1-7 Keady 0-5 report in [http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/kittens-claim-allireland-club-hattrick-69481.html Irish Independent] and [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2006/1120/1163947707012.html Irish Times]</ref><ref>2007 Junior club final Harps 2-8 Keady 2-7 report in [https://archive.is/20120804150607/http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/cashel-and-harps-take-top-club-honours-1222876.html Irish Independent], [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2007/1119/1195251431520.html Irish Times] and on [http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/29/Cashel-and-Harps-are-champions/Default.aspx camogie.ie]</ref> Keady L\u00e1mh Dhearg and [[Ballymacnab Round Towers GAC#Camogie|St Brenda's Ballymacnab]] have won divisional honours at [[F\u00e9ile na nGael]].

The county board is also responsible for the Armagh inter-county teams.\n\n==Kits, colours and crest==\nArmagh's county colours are Orange and White.

Several clubs were already in existence before the formation of the County Board in 1889.<ref>[http://www.newrymemoirs.com/stories_pages/relandpolsplitgaa_1.html Newry Memoirs] feature on GAA</ref> \n\nArmagh became only the second team to win the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] in 1890. In the early years of the GAA, a club that won its county championship went on to represent the county and would also wear the county colours. [[Armagh Harps GFC|Armagh Harps]] represented Armagh in the Ulster final, beating Tyrone (Cookstown's [[Cookstown Fr. Rock's GAC|Owen Roes]]), but losing to All-Ireland Champions Cork ([[Midleton GAA|Midleton]]) in the All-Ireland Semi-Final.\n\nDespite early success at provincial level, national success at junior and minor level and All-Ireland final appearances in 1953 and 1977, it took until 2002 for Armagh to win their first and only [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] under manager [[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]]. The county won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, in 1949 and again in 2009, but lost the 1957 All-Ireland Minor final to Meath.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2009 campaign which resulted in Armagh being defeated by Tyrone, Peter McDonnell stepped down as Armagh manager. He was replaced by [[Paddy O'Rourke (Down footballer)|Paddy O'Rourke]], who is from the neighbouring county of [[Down GAA|Down]]. Paddy O'Rourke was replaced by Paul Grimley who managed Armagh for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. In 2015 [[Kieran McGeeney]] took over as manager in a five year contract that was extended by a year in 2019 to 2020.\n\n===The Two Brian's Era (1995 - 2001)===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !!! style=\"background:orange\"| Total\n|-\n| '''! style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Played''' || 38 || 13 || 5 || 56\n|-\n| '''! style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Won''' || 18 || 7 || 2 || 27\n|-\n| '''! style=\"background:orange\"|'''Percentage Won''' || 47.37% || 53.85% || 40.00% || 48.22%\n|}\n\n===Joe Kernan's Golden Era (2002 - 2006) ===\n\n[[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]] is widely regarded as Armagh's most successful manager having won one League title, four Ulster Championships and one All Ireland Championship.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

In his first season as Armagh manager, McGeeney secured promotion to division 2 of the National Football League and beating [[Fermanagh]] in the final - this would be his first of two division 3 NFL titles. In his first Ulster championship as manager, Armagh were defeated by [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] on a scoreline of 0-8 to 2-11. Armagh's championship continued through the qualifiers where they managed a single win over [[Wicklow]] before being defeated by [[Galway]] in round 2. \n\nThe 2016 NFL campaign ended with four teams finishing on the same points but by virtue of having a poor scoring difference Armagh were relegated to division 3.

Armagh continued their championship in round 1 of the qualifiers where they beat [[Westmeath]], [[Sligo]] and [[Clare GAA]] but were unable to overcome Connacht finalists [[Roscommon]]. \n\nThe 2019 campaign started off with Armagh securing their division 2 status with two wins and two draws.

However, in recent years the county hurlers have shown a marked improvement under the guidance of manager Mattie Lennon and his assistant Ger Rogan.\n\nIn 2006 Armagh won the NHL Division 3 championship, winning all their games in the group stages before beating Louth 3-10 to 1-11 in the final at Breffni Park in Cavan. The step up to Division 2 proved to be a difficult one for the men from the Orchard County. While the team failed to win any of their group games they were unfortunate to lose to Meath and also managed to come within a point of the 2006 [[Christy Ring Cup]] finalists Carlow. Heavier defeats were suffered at the hands of more established counties such as Derry and Laois.\n\nArmagh returned to the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] in May 2007 for the first time in almost 60 years with a match against Derry. Despite putting in a strong performance the team lost out on the chance of a semi-final encounter with neighbours Down to an injury-time score.\n\nThe advances made in the county over the past two years placed them as favourites in the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] encounter on August 12 against Roscommon; however they lost this game by two points.\n\nIn 2010, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup, beating London on a scoreline of 3-15 to 3-14 on 3 July in Croke Park. The Minor team won the Ulster Minor Hurling League Division One title and reached the Ulster Minor Hurling Championship Final. The Under 21 team also reached the Ulster U21 Championship Final.\n\nIn 2011 the senior side reached the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] final for the first time since 1946 and made it to the [[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]] final for the second year in a row for the first time in their history.\nArmagh then won Division 2B in 2016 earning promotion to Division 2A. They were then subsequently relegated.\nThey then beat Down in the Ulster Hurling championship semi final giving them a place in the final where they were beaten.
