Accessed May 30, 2012.</ref> The rolling hills and rich soils which produce bountiful agricultural crops drew Native American tribes and then Europeans to the area.\n\n==Geology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America and rode over the top of the North American plate. The rock from the islands created the highlands of Hunterdon County as there was a shallow sea where Hunterdon County is now located.  Then around four hundred million B.C., a small continent that was long and thin, collided with proto North America. This collision created compression, which caused heat. The Paleozoic sediment of shale and sandstone folded and faulted. The heat allowed the igneous rock to bend, thus Hunterdon County was born.\n\nThe African plate which later collided with North America created more folding and faulting, especially in the southern Appalachians.  Then the African and North America plates tore and drifted away from each other.\n\nThe Wisconsin glacier that entered into New Jersey around 21,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] and then melted around 13,000 BCE did not reach Hunterdon County. However, there are glacial outwash deposits from streams and rivers that flowed from the glacier southward depositing rock and sediment.\n\nHunterdon County has two geophysical provinces.  The first is the Highlands which is the western section of the county.  The other is the Piedmont which is the eastern and southern section of the county.  The Highlands account for one-third of the area and Piedmont accounts for two-thirds of the county.\n\nThe Highlands are part of the Reading Prong.  Limestone and shale over igneous rock comprise the Highlands.\n\nPiedmont includes the Hunterdon Plateau and the Raritan Valley Lowlands which are {{convert|150|to|300|ft}} above sea level.  Piedmont is made up of shale and sandstone.\n\n[[File: Califon Bridge.JPG|thumb|The bridge over the South Branch of the Raritan River in Califon.]]\n[[File: Oldwick General Store.JPG|thumb|Oldwick General Store]]\n\n==Paleo Indians and Native Americans==\nPaleo Indians moved into Hunterdon County between 12,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE. The area was warming due to climate change.  The Wisconsin Glacier in Warren and Sussex County was retreating northward.  The area was that of Taiga/Boreal forests. Paleo Indians traveled in small groups in search of game and edible plants.  They used spears made of bone, jasper or black chert.  Their camp sites are difficult to find as they are many feet below the present surface.\n\nNative Americans moved into the area but the time they arrived is unknown. Most have come from the Mississippi River area.  Many tribes of the Delaware Nation lived in Hunterdon County especially along the Delaware River and in the Flemington area.  These tribes were agricultural in nature, growing corn, beans and squash.  Those that lived along the South Branch of the Raritan River fished and farmed.  There was a Native American trail that went along the South Branch of the Raritan River (Philhower 1924).\n\n==European settlement==\nLand purchases from Native Americans occurred from 1688 to 1758.  Large land purchases from Native Americans occurred in 1703, 1709 and 1710.  Over {{convert|150000|acre|km2}} were bought with metal knives and pots, clothing, blankets, barrels of rum or hard cider, guns, powder and shot.  This allowed for European settlers to enter into Hunterdon County in the early 18th century.  After 1760, nearly all Native Americans left New Jersey and relocated to eastern Canada or the Mississippi River area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe first European settlers were Col.

Accessed May 30, 2012.</ref> The rolling hills and rich soils which produce bountiful agricultural crops drew Native American tribes and then Europeans to the area.\n\n==Geology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America and rode over the top of the North American plate. The rock from the islands created the highlands of Hunterdon County as there was a shallow sea where Hunterdon County is now located.  Then around four hundred million B.C., a small continent that was long and thin, collided with proto North America. This collision created compression, which caused heat. The Paleozoic sediment of shale and sandstone folded and faulted. The heat allowed the igneous rock to bend, thus Hunterdon County was born.\n\nThe African plate which later collided with North America created more folding and faulting, especially in the southern Appalachians.  Then the African and North America plates tore and drifted away from each other.\n\nThe Wisconsin glacier that entered into New Jersey around 21,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] and then melted around 13,000 BCE did not reach Hunterdon County. However, there are glacial outwash deposits from streams and rivers that flowed from the glacier southward depositing rock and sediment.\n\nHunterdon County has two geophysical provinces.  The first is the Highlands which is the western section of the county.  The other is the Piedmont which is the eastern and southern section of the county.  The Highlands account for one-third of the area and Piedmont accounts for two-thirds of the county.\n\nThe Highlands are part of the Reading Prong.  Limestone and shale over igneous rock comprise the Highlands.\n\nPiedmont includes the Hunterdon Plateau and the Raritan Valley Lowlands which are {{convert|150|to|300|ft}} above sea level.  Piedmont is made up of shale and sandstone.\n\n[[File: Califon Bridge.JPG|thumb|The bridge over the South Branch of the Raritan River in Califon.]]\n[[File: Oldwick General Store.JPG|thumb|Oldwick General Store]]\n\n==Paleo Indians and Native Americans==\nPaleo Indians moved into Hunterdon County between 12,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE. The area was warming due to climate change.  The Wisconsin Glacier in Warren and Sussex County was retreating northward.  The area was that of Taiga/Boreal forests. Paleo Indians traveled in small groups in search of game and edible plants.  They used spears made of bone, jasper or black chert.  Their camp sites are difficult to find as they are many feet below the present surface.\n\nNative Americans moved into the area but the time they arrived is unknown. Most have come from the Mississippi River area.  Many tribes of the Delaware Nation lived in Hunterdon County especially along the Delaware River and in the Flemington area.  These tribes were agricultural in nature, growing corn, beans and squash.  Those that lived along the South Branch of the Raritan River fished and farmed.  There was a Native American trail that went along the South Branch of the Raritan River (Philhower 1924).\n\n==European settlement==\nLand purchases from Native Americans occurred from 1688 to 1758.  Large land purchases from Native Americans occurred in 1703, 1709 and 1710.  Over {{convert|150000|acre|km2}} were bought with metal knives and pots, clothing, blankets, barrels of rum or hard cider, guns, powder and shot.  This allowed for European settlers to enter into Hunterdon County in the early 18th century.  After 1760, nearly all Native Americans left New Jersey and relocated to eastern Canada or the Mississippi River area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe first European settlers were Col.
