To string a kendama together, you need a bead (or mini bearing) and a piece of string. The steps to string a kendama together are:\n# Take one end of the string and put it through the little hole in the ''tama'' until the string is coming through the big hole (''ana'').\n# Put the bead on the end of the string coming out of the ''ana'' and tie a knot to lock the bead in.\n# Put the untied end of the string through one of the two holes in the ''sarado''. ('''Note:''' If you want a '''right handed kendama''', hold the ''sarado'' up so that the big cup is on the right side and put the string through the whole that is facing you. If you want a '''left handed kendama,''' make sure the big cup is on the left side and put the string through the hole facing you).\n#Lead the string through the hole in the ''ken''.\n# Tie a knot at that end of the string so the string doesn't slip through the ''ken'' piece.\n# Put the ''sarado'' down on top of the ''ken''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU&t=349s|title=How to Change a Kendama String|last=|publisher=YoTricks|date=October 29, 2015|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA video of this process can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU here][[File:Grips of a kendama.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Ken Grip (top left), Sara Grip (top right), Candle Grip (bottom left), Tama Grip (bottom right)]]\n\n=== Grips ===\nA kendama can be held in numerous types of grips. The grip that a person decides to holds a kendama in depends on what trick that person wants to try and perform. Some of these grips include:\n\n*'''Ken grip:''' Hold the ken with all five fingers with the spike pointing upwards and the big cup (or small cup) facing towards your body\n*'''Sara grip:''' hold the ken by placing your thumb and index finger below the intersection of the ''sarado'' and ''ken''.\n**'''Sara grip (stabilized):''' In addition to the thumb and index finger placement, put your middle and ring finger underneath the small cup or big cup (this depends on which way the ken is facing).\n*'''Tama grip:''' With your fingertips, hold the ball (''tama'') with the hole (''ana'') facing upwards.\n*'''Candle grip:''' Face the ken with the spike pointed downward. Hold the ken with three fingers: index, middle, and the thumb.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== How to Play ==\nThe general concept of kendama is pulling the ''ken'' up and balancing the ''tama'' somewhere on the ''ken'', or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama.

Later on, some people replaced the deer horn with a piece of bamboo due to deer horn costing too may resources, making the '''bamboo and ball'''. The next model started to resemble what the kendama looks like today: the '''ken and ball'''. This model was a ''ken'' piece strung to the ball.\n\nThe '''jisugetsu ball''' kendama model was the first model made by Ekusa (1919), and later went on to be produced as many as 300,000 times in one year by Hongo woodworking factory in Hatsukaichi (1921). The ''jisugetsu'' has a similar design as lined folk craft kendamas, which were made by factories that also produced [[Kokeshi|Kokeshi dolls]] from [[Lathe|spinning lathe machines]].<ref name=\":3\" /> The strings of both the jisugetsu ball and folk craft kendamas were placed on the ''ken'' using a loose metal fitting, making the string prone to detaching or breaking.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe '''S (Shinma)-Type kendama''' was the first competition style kendama invented in 1975 by Hideo Shinma, the president of the Tokyo Kendama Club.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://kendama.or.jp/english/history/jka-history/|title=JKA History|last=|first=|date=|website=Japan Kendama Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=February 1, 2020|access-date=}}</ref> The first S-type prototype emerged in 1976, and the ''Japan Kendama Association'' (JKA) asked Shinma to make them a competition style model based on the S-Type design in 1977.\n\nThe '''F (Fujiwara)-Type''' '''(F16)''' kendama emerged in 1978, invented by Issei Fujiwara. The F-Type incorporated new modifications unknown to kendamas at the time. The F-Type had two small holes drilled in the middle of each side of the ''sarado'', and also used a sturdier string that was unlikely to break. The two string holes in the ''sarado'' offer more fluidity of play as well as the option to switch the kendama between left handed or right handed.\n\nThe '''Tortoise''' kendama by Tortoise, Inc. was a take on the S-type kendama after the S-type discontinued in '''1990'''. Tortoise kendamas came in different models: the T-8,   T-14, T-16, and T-17. The numbers indicating each different Tortoise model corresponds with the height of each model in centimeters. Tortoise kendamas stopped production in 2012 due to not having enough resources.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe '''F16-2''', the second version of the F16, was released in 2001. The main change in the F16-2 from the F16 is that the position of the string hole was moved slightly off from the cup body's center, enabling the kendama to turn and rotate in a new fluid way. This string hole adjustment is still used in various shapes of kendamas to this day.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Contemporary Culture==\nKendama has increased in popularity since its initial evolution in Japan. During the 2000s, kendama surged in popularity outside Japan, which influenced the creation of the first kendama companies in foreign countries.\n\nThe first kendama company in the United States was Kendama USA in 2006.<ref name=\"KendamaUSA - About2\">{{cite web|url=http://kendamausa.com/about/|title=What is a Kendama?|publisher=Kendama USA}}</ref> They began to promote kendama in North America and were able to reach the [[winter sports]], [[BMX|bmx]], and [[rollerblading]] communities.

However, all forms of kendama competition are regulated by rules. 4 styles of kendama competition are: speed ladder, open division, freestyle, and Kendama World Cup (KWC). It is rare that the KWC style of competing is used an event other than KWC itself.\n\n=== Speed Ladder ===\nThe '''speed ladder''' is a style of competition is a race of who can finish a set of tricks the fastest. Players will race through an order of tricks that they are given at the event or prior to the event via the internet. The players who finish the trick ladder the fastest wins. There are divisions that sign up to compete in based on their skill level (ex: '''beginner, intermediate,''' and '''advanced/pro''').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sweetskendamas.com/blogs/blog/mko-2016-trick-lists|title=MKO 2016 Trick List|last=Jorgenson|first=Matthew|date=September 9, 2016|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Open Division ===\n'''Open Division''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 competition style format. Each round, 2 players compete against each other and take turns drawing a trick at random. Each trick drawn warrants a maximum of 3 exchanges - the number of times the players can go back and forth attempting the trick. '''The first player to 3 points wins'''.\n\n*If a player completes the trick and the other player misses, the successful player earns 1 point and the other player draws another trick.\n* If both players complete or miss the trick, then the 1st exchange comes to an end and the first player gets another attempt to complete the trick in the 2nd bout, restarting the process. \n** If both players complete or miss the trick in all 3 bouts, then the trick is discarded and the second player draws a new trick\n\n'''Note:''' In the final round, the first player to '''5 points''' wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/amateur-open-division-1|title=Amateur Open Division|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Note:''' The labeled champion of each event is usually referring to the Open Division winner.\n\n=== Freestyle ===\n'''Freestyle''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 style of competition.  Each match is judged by a panel of 3 or 5 judges. The 2 players competing against each other in each round will take turns performing tricks in 45 second time periods twice each. During the time periods, both players may perform any trick that they choose.\n\nEach judge individually decides which player wins based on who did the best in the following 3 categories: ''Creativity, Consistency,'' and ''Difficulty''. The player with the most votes wins the round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/freestyle-registration|title=Freestyle + Open|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== KWC ===\n120 tricks are released online prior to the KWC and are split up into groups of 10 tricks each 12 times, forming a level 1- level 12 trick list. The higher level a trick is, the more difficult it is and the more points it is worth. KWC is split into 2 days of competition: Day 1: Qualifying & Day 2: Finals. Each day has its own set of rules.\n\nDuring '''Day 1''', all players choose 12 tricks from the levels 1-10 in the trick list. Players split the 12 tricks into two rounds of 6 tricks each, and each player will get 3 minutes for each round to complete as many tricks as possible. The 25 players with the highest point scores will advance to Day 2.\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the face value of the level of the trick. (ex. level 6 trick is worth 6 points).\n\nDuring '''Day 2''', the players compete one by one from the lowest scoring qualifying player to the highest scoring qualifying player. Each player has 3 minutes to do an unlimited number of tricks from levels 3-12, and each trick can only be done once. The player who gets the highest number of points in their time period wins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the level of that trick squared (ex. level 6 trick is worth 36 points), with the exception of level 11 tricks (worth 151 points) and level 12 tricks (worth 194 points).\n\n==Competitions==\nKendama competitions have been occurring since 1979, with the first competition being the All Japan Kendama-Do Championships held by the Japan Kendama Association.<ref name=\"Japanese Kendama Association - History\">{{cite web|url=http://kendama.or.jp/information/jka_history/|title=\u3051\u3093\u7389\u5354\u4f1a\u306e\u6cbf\u9769|publisher=}}</ref> The British Kendama Association was the first group to hold a formal kendama contest outside Japan in 2008 at the British Juggling Convention in [[Doncaster]].

The event is currently hosted by Kentucky-based kendama company Sol Kendamas. The event occurs on the first weekend of each January in Tennessee, USA.\n\nJune 2011, the first public Kendama competition (battle) was held in the state of Tennessee. The event occurred in the city of Nashville hosted by a kendama blog called the \"Kensession Stand\". The event was called the \"Nashville Kendama Battle\", and was held at 12th South Taproom. \nIn subsequent years, a group of kendama players called The Kendama Squad (Chad Covington, Nicholas Bellamy, and John Ross Rudolph) -- alongside the Kensession Stand (Tyler Marshall) -- hosted annual kendama battles in Clarksville, Tennessee. While the competition continued to occur annually, the name \"Battle at the Border\" was not implemented until the 2014 competition. In 2015, Sol Kendamas began officially coordinating the event. In 2015, the competition reached its largest attendance (approximately 150 people). Battle at the Border (2015-2016) was held in Nashville, Tennessee on the first weekend of January at Rocketown. Battle at the Border (2017-2018) was held on the first weekend of January at The Foundry in Nashville, TN.

It consists of a handle (''ken''), a pair of cups (''sarado''), and a ball (''tama'') that are all connected together by a string. On one end of the ''ken'' is a cup, while the other end of ''ken'' is narrowed down, forming a spike (''kensaki'') that fits into the hole (''ana'') of the ''tama''. The ''kendama'' is the Japanese version of the classic [[cup-and-ball]] game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kendama.or.jp/english/about/kendama/|title=Kendama|last=|first=|date=|website=Japan Kendama Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> and is also a variant of the French cup-and-ball game ''bilboquet''. Kendama can be held in different grips, and the tricks and combinations that can be done are limitless.          The principle of these toys are the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string.\n\nThe origins of kendama are disputed, but it is generally believed to have originated during the 17th or 18th century. Kendama started to evolutionize when it came to Japan during the [[Edo period]], and since then the use of the toy has spread throughout the world. The size and materials used to create kendamas now vary as they are offered in jumbo and mini sizes, and have been created out plastic, metal, and nylon. There are now kendama competitions held in countries all over the world, the biggest competition being the annual Kendama World Cup in Japan.\n\n==Structure and Terminology==\n[[File:Kendama Parts Numbered.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Anatomy of kendama]]\nThe ''kendama'' is traditionally made out of wood and comprises the following parts:\n# Main body {{nihongo||\u5263|ken}}.\n# Spike {{nihongo||\u5263\u5148|kensaki}}.\n# Big cup {{nihongo||\u5927\u76bf|\u014dzara}}.\n# Base cup {{nihongo||\u4e2d\u76bf|ch\u016bzara}}.\n# Small cup {{nihongo||\u5c0f\u76bf|kozara}}.\n# Tama  {{nihongo||\u7389|tama}}.\n# Hole {{nihongo||\u7a74|ana}}.\n# String  {{nihongo||\u7cf8|ito}}.\n# Cup body {{nihongo||\u76bf\u80f4|sarad\u014d}}.\n# Small cup edge {{nihongo||\u5c0f\u76bf\u306e\u3075\u3061|kozara no fuchi}}.\n# Big cup for lunars {{nihongo||\u5927\u76bf\u306e\u3075\u3061|\u014dzara no fuchi}}.\n# Slip-stop or slip grip {{nihongo||\u3059\u3079\u308a\u6b62\u3081|suberidome}}.\n# Back end {{nihongo||\u3051\u3093\u3058\u308a|kenjiri}}.\n# String attachment hole {{nihongo||\u7cf8\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u7a74|ito toritsuke ana}}.\n# Bead (not pictured)\n\n=== Stringing a Kendama ===\n\"Stringing\" a kendama is the action of connecting all 3 pieces of the kendama (''ken, sarado,'' and ''tama'') together. To string a kendama together, you need a bead (or mini bearing) and a piece of string. The steps to string a kendama together are:\n# Take one end of the string and put it through the little hole in the ''tama'' until the string is coming through the big hole (''ana'').\n# Put the bead on the end of the string coming out of the ''ana'' and tie a knot to lock the bead in.\n# Put the untied end of the string through one of the two holes in the ''sarado''. ('''Note:''' If you want a '''right handed kendama''', hold the ''sarado'' up so that the big cup is on the right side and put the string through the whole that is facing you. If you want a '''left handed kendama,''' make sure the big cup is on the left side and put the string through the hole facing you).\n#Lead the string through the hole in the ''ken''.\n# Tie a knot at that end of the string so the string doesn't slip through the ''ken'' piece.\n# Put the ''sarado'' down on top of the ''ken''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU&t=349s|title=How to Change a Kendama String|last=|publisher=YoTricks|date=October 29, 2015|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA video of this process can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU here][[File:Grips of a kendama.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Ken Grip (top left), Sara Grip (top right), Candle Grip (bottom left), Tama Grip (bottom right)]]\n\n=== Grips ===\nA kendama can be held in numerous types of grips. The grip that a person decides to holds a kendama in depends on what trick that person wants to try and perform. Some of these grips include:\n\n*'''Ken grip:''' Hold the ken with all five fingers with the spike pointing upwards and the big cup (or small cup) facing towards your body\n*'''Sara grip:''' hold the ken by placing your thumb and index finger below the intersection of the ''sarado'' and ''ken''.\n**'''Sara grip (stabilized):''' In addition to the thumb and index finger placement, put your middle and ring finger underneath the small cup or big cup (this depends on which way the ken is facing).\n*'''Tama grip:''' With your fingertips, hold the ball (''tama'') with the hole (''ana'') facing upwards.\n*'''Candle grip:''' Face the ken with the spike pointed downward. Hold the ken with three fingers: index, middle, and the thumb.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== How to Play ==\nThe general concept of kendama is pulling the ''ken'' up and balancing the ''tama'' somewhere on the ''ken'', or vice versa.

Later on, some people replaced the deer horn with a piece of bamboo due to deer horn costing too may resources, making the '''bamboo and ball'''. The next model started to resemble what the kendama looks like today: the '''ken and ball'''. This model was a ''ken'' piece strung to the ball.\n\nThe '''jisugetsu ball''' kendama model was the first model made by Ekusa (1919), and later went on to be produced as many as 300,000 times in one year by Hongo woodworking factory in Hatsukaichi (1921). The ''jisugetsu'' has a similar design as lined folk craft kendamas, which were made by factories that also produced [[Kokeshi|Kokeshi dolls]] from [[Lathe|spinning lathe machines]].<ref name=\":3\" /> The strings of both the jisugetsu ball and folk craft kendamas were placed on the ''ken'' using a loose metal fitting, making the string prone to detaching or breaking.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe '''S (Shinma)-Type kendama''' was the first competition style kendama invented in 1975 by Hideo Shinma, the president of the Tokyo Kendama Club.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://kendama.or.jp/english/history/jka-history/|title=JKA History|last=|first=|date=|website=Japan Kendama Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=February 1, 2020|access-date=}}</ref> The first S-type prototype emerged in 1976, and the ''Japan Kendama Association'' (JKA) asked Shinma to make them a competition style model based on the S-Type design in 1977.\n\nThe '''F (Fujiwara)-Type''' '''(F16)''' kendama emerged in 1978, invented by Issei Fujiwara. The F-Type incorporated new modifications unknown to kendamas at the time. The F-Type had two small holes drilled in the middle of each side of the ''sarado'', and also used a sturdier string that was unlikely to break. The two string holes in the ''sarado'' offer more fluidity of play as well as the option to switch the kendama between left handed or right handed.\n\nThe '''Tortoise''' kendama by Tortoise, Inc. was a take on the S-type kendama after the S-type discontinued in '''1990'''. Tortoise kendamas came in different models: the T-8,   T-14, T-16, and T-17. The numbers indicating each different Tortoise model corresponds with the height of each model in centimeters. Tortoise kendamas stopped production in 2012 due to not having enough resources.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe '''F16-2''', the second version of the F16, was released in 2001. The main change in the F16-2 from the F16 is that the position of the string hole was moved slightly off from the cup body's center, enabling the kendama to turn and rotate in a new fluid way. This string hole adjustment is still used in various shapes of kendamas to this day.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Contemporary Culture==\nKendama has increased in popularity since its initial evolution in Japan. During the 2000s, kendama surged in popularity outside Japan, which influenced the creation of the first kendama companies in foreign countries.\n\nThe first kendama company in the United States was Kendama USA in 2006.<ref name=\"KendamaUSA - About2\">{{cite web|url=http://kendamausa.com/about/|title=What is a Kendama?|publisher=Kendama USA}}</ref> They began to promote kendama in North America and were able to reach the [[winter sports]], [[BMX|bmx]], and [[rollerblading]] communities.

However, all forms of kendama competition are regulated by rules. 4 styles of kendama competition are: speed ladder, open division, freestyle, and Kendama World Cup (KWC). It is rare that the KWC style of competing is used an event other than KWC itself.\n\n=== Speed Ladder ===\nThe '''speed ladder''' is a style of competition is a race of who can finish a set of tricks the fastest. Players will race through an order of tricks that they are given at the event or prior to the event via the internet. The players who finish the trick ladder the fastest wins. There are divisions that sign up to compete in based on their skill level (ex: '''beginner, intermediate,''' and '''advanced/pro''').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sweetskendamas.com/blogs/blog/mko-2016-trick-lists|title=MKO 2016 Trick List|last=Jorgenson|first=Matthew|date=September 9, 2016|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Open Division ===\n'''Open Division''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 competition style format. Each round, 2 players compete against each other and take turns drawing a trick at random. Each trick drawn warrants a maximum of 3 exchanges - the number of times the players can go back and forth attempting the trick. '''The first player to 3 points wins'''.\n\n*If a player completes the trick and the other player misses, the successful player earns 1 point and the other player draws another trick.\n* If both players complete or miss the trick, then the 1st exchange comes to an end and the first player gets another attempt to complete the trick in the 2nd bout, restarting the process. \n** If both players complete or miss the trick in all 3 bouts, then the trick is discarded and the second player draws a new trick\n\n'''Note:''' In the final round, the first player to '''5 points''' wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/amateur-open-division-1|title=Amateur Open Division|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Note:''' The labeled champion of each event is usually referring to the Open Division winner.\n\n=== Freestyle ===\n'''Freestyle''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 style of competition.  Each match is judged by a panel of 3 or 5 judges. The 2 players competing against each other in each round will take turns performing tricks in 45 second time periods twice each. During the time periods, both players may perform any trick that they choose.\n\nEach judge individually decides which player wins based on who did the best in the following 3 categories: ''Creativity, Consistency,'' and ''Difficulty''. The player with the most votes wins the round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/freestyle-registration|title=Freestyle + Open|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== KWC ===\n120 tricks are released online prior to the KWC and are split up into groups of 10 tricks each 12 times, forming a level 1- level 12 trick list. The higher level a trick is, the more difficult it is and the more points it is worth. KWC is split into 2 days of competition: Day 1: Qualifying & Day 2: Finals. Each day has its own set of rules.\n\nDuring '''Day 1''', all players choose 12 tricks from the levels 1-10 in the trick list. Players split the 12 tricks into two rounds of 6 tricks each, and each player will get 3 minutes for each round to complete as many tricks as possible. The 25 players with the highest point scores will advance to Day 2.\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the face value of the level of the trick.
