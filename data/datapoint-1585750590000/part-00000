{"title_page": "Quiet Revolution", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\nThe '''Quiet Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|R\u00e9volution tranquille}}) was a period of intense socio-political and socio-cultural change in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]], characterized by the effective [[secularization]] of government, the creation of a state-run [[welfare state]] (''\u00e9tat-providence''), and realignment of politics into [[Quebec federalism|federalist]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] (or [[Separatism|separatist]]) factions and the eventual election of a pro-sovereignty provincial government in the [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 election]]. The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal government of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960), and sometimes [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970 after the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'s [[Daniel Johnson Sr.|Daniel Johnson]] in 1966), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.\n\nA primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]]. It took measures to increase Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois control over [[economy of Quebec|the province's economy]] and [[Nationalization|nationalized]] electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the [[Canada Pension Plan|Canada/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan]]. [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] was also created in an attempt to nationalize Qu\u00e9bec's electric companies. French-Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec also adopted the new name 'Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois', trying to create a separate identity from France and establish themselves as a reformed province.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Canada]] and paralleled similar developments in the [[Western world|West]] in general. It was a byproduct of Canada's 20-year post-war expansion and Qu\u00e9bec's position as the leading province for more than a century before and after [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]]. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of [[Montreal]], Qu\u00e9bec's leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Qu\u00e9bec's borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism,<ref>{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/372 372] }}</ref> French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover, certain facets of the welfare state, as they developed in Qu\u00e9bec in the 1960s, became nationalized by virtue of Qu\u00e9bec's acceptance and promotion. This would include [[rural electrification]] and healthcare initiatives undertaken by [[Tommy Douglas]] in [[Saskatchewan]] twenty years earlier.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:PlaceDArmes by Msteckiw.jpg|thumb|The hill leading to [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal, an important historic site of French Canada]]\n\nThe Quiet Revolution began with the enacted [[Parti lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec|Liberal]] provincial government of [[Jean Lesage]], who was elected in the June [[1960 Quebec general election|1960 provincial election]], shortly after the death of Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], whose tenure was known by some as the [[Grande Noirceur]] (Great Darkness), but viewed by conservatives as epitomizing a religiously and culturally pure Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the government of Qu\u00e9bec was controlled by the conservative Duplessis, leader of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] party. Not all the Catholic Church supported Duplessis - some Catholic unions and members of the clergy criticized him, including Montreal Archbishop [[Joseph Charbonneau]] - but the bulk of the small-town and rural clergy supported him.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\">{{cite book |last=Behiels |first=Michael |title=Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/preludetoquebecs0000behi |url-access=registration |date=1985 |publisher=McGill}}</ref> Some quoted the Union Nationale slogan ''Le ciel est bleu, l'enfer est rouge'' (The sky (Heaven) is blue, Hell is red) as a reference to the colours of the Union Nationale (blue) and the Liberals (red), the latter accused often of being pro-communist.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} [[Radio-Canada]], the newspaper ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and political journal ''[[Cit\u00e9 Libre]]'' were [[intellectual]] forums for critics of the Duplessis government.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\" />\n\nPrior to the Quiet Revolution, the province's natural resources were developed mainly by foreign investors.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} As an example, the process of mining iron ore was developed by the US-based [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]].

Qu\u00e9bec set up a Ministry of Public Instruction in 1868 but abolished it in 1875 under pressure from the Catholic Church. The clergy believed it would be able to provide appropriate teaching to young people and that the province should not interfere. By the early 1960s, there were more than 1,500 school boards, each responsible for its own programs, textbooks and the recognition of diplomas according to its own criteria.\n\nIn addition, until the Quiet Revolution, higher education was accessible to only a minority of French Canadians because of the generally low level of formal education and the expense involved.<ref name=\"parent\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/scripts/explore.php?Lang=1&elementid=107__true&tableid=11&tablename=theme&contentlong |title= Education in Qu\u00e9bec, before and after the Parent reform |author= Mathieu Pigeon |publisher= McCord Museum |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> Moreover, secondary schools had placed a lot more emphasis on the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and [[Soft Science|soft sciences]] than the [[Hard and soft science|hard sciences]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Canada, face of a nation|date=2000|publisher=Gage Educational Pub|others=Bolotta, Angelo, 1951-, Gerrard, Dennis, 1944-, Shortt, Denise.|isbn=0771581521|location=Scarborough, Ont.|oclc=43276936}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Montr\u00e9al UQ\u00c1M.JPG|thumb|[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]]]]\n\nFollowing [[World War&nbsp;II]], while most of the United States and Canada was enjoying a long period of prosperity and modernization, economic growth was slower in Qu\u00e9bec.{{Citation needed| date=February 2013}} The level of formal schooling among French-Canadians was quite low: only 13% finished grade 11, as opposed to 36% of English Canadians. One of the most scathing attacks on the educational system was levelled by Brother [[Jean-Paul Desbiens]], writing under the pseudonym of Fr\u00e8re [[wikt:Untel|Untel]].

There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns, which previously had attracted 2\u20133% of Qu\u00e9bec's young women. Many left the convent while very few young women entered. The Provincial government took over the nuns' traditional role as provider of many of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c's educational and social services. Often ex-nuns continued the same roles in civilian dress; and for the first time men started entering the teaching profession.<ref>Micheline D'Allaire, \"Les Religieuses du Quebec dans le Courant de la Laicisation\", ''Cultures du Canada Francais'' (1986), Vol. 3, pp 38-45.</ref>\n\nAlso during the time of the Quiet Revolution, Quebec experienced a large drop in the [[total fertility rate]] (known as TFR: the lifetime average number of live births per woman of child-bearing age) falling from 3.8 in 1960 to 1.9 in 1970.<ref>{{cite book |first1= Jean |last1= Bernier |first2= Laurent |last2= Roy |title= Family Policy, Social Trends and Fertility in Qu\u00e9bec: Experimenting with the Nordic Model?| publisher= The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women |year= 2007 |page= 11 }}</ref> According to a study commissioned in 2007 by The Qu\u00e9bec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women on possible ways to address problems related to a by then even lower TFR (1.6) \"Starting in 1960, Qu\u00e9bec experienced a drop in fertility that was so sharp and rapid, it was almost unparalleled in the developed countries.\" <ref>{{cite book |first1= Jean |last1= Bernier |first2= Laurent |last2= Roy |title= Family Policy, Social Trends and Fertility in Qu\u00e9bec: Experimenting with the Nordic Model?| publisher= The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women |year= 2007 |page= 5 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 2003 article \"Where Have All the Children Gone?\", published in the academic journal ''Canadian Studies in Population'' by Professor Catherine Krull of Queen's University and Professor Frank Trovato of The University of Alberta, point to the decline in influence of the Roman Catholic Church over the lives of French-Canadians as one of the causes of the great reduction in the TFR during the Quiet Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |first1= Catherine |last1= Krull |first2= Frank |last2= Trovato |title= Where Have All the Children Gone?| publisher= Canadian Studies in Population |year= 2003 |pages= 197\u2013198 }}{{better source|date=September 2018}}</ref> According to a on Quebec History course taught and published study by Professor Claude Belanger of Montreal's Marianopolis College the lose of influence of the RC Church and subsequent abandonment long adhered to Church teaching concerning procreation was a key factor in Quebec going from having the highest provincial birth rate in 1960 to the lowest in 1970.\n\n== Economic reforms ==\n[[File:Manic-2 (2).jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's [[Jean-Lesage generating station]], formerly known as Manic-2, built between 1961 and 1965.|alt=A big concrete structure.]]\n\nSeeking a mandate for its most daring reform, the nationalization of the province's electric companies under [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]], the Liberal Party called for a new [[1962 Quebec general election|election in 1962]].

In 1963, in conjunction with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own ''R\u00e9gie des Rentes du Qu\u00e9bec'' (RRQ, Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan); universal contributions came into effect in 1966. The [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ, Qu\u00e9bec Deposit and Investment Fund) was created in 1965 to manage the considerable revenues generated by the RRQ and to provide the capital necessary for various projects in the public and private sectors.\n\nA new labour code (''Code du Travail'') was adopted in 1964. It made unionizing much easier and gave public employees the right to strike. It was during the same year that the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec|Code Civil]]'' (Civil Code) was modified to recognize the legal equality of spouses.

The bill also restricted the eligibility for elementary and high school students to attend school in English, allowing this only for children of parents who had studied in English in Qu\u00e9bec.

Noted Qu\u00e9bec historian {{interlanguage link|Jacques Rouillard|fr|vertical-align=sup}} took this [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec\u2019s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.<ref name=\"Jacques Rouillard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=Winter 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d\u2019\u00e9tudes canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral arguments support this view.

The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal government of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960), and sometimes [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970 after the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'s [[Daniel Johnson Sr.|Daniel Johnson]] in 1966), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.\n\nA primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]]. It took measures to increase Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois control over [[economy of Quebec|the province's economy]] and [[Nationalization|nationalized]] electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the [[Canada Pension Plan|Canada/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan]]. [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] was also created in an attempt to nationalize Qu\u00e9bec's electric companies. French-Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec also adopted the new name 'Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois', trying to create a separate identity from France and establish themselves as a reformed province.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Canada]] and paralleled similar developments in the [[Western world|West]] in general. It was a byproduct of Canada's 20-year post-war expansion and Qu\u00e9bec's position as the leading province for more than a century before and after [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]]. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of [[Montreal]], Qu\u00e9bec's leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Qu\u00e9bec's borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism,<ref>{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/372 372] }}</ref> French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover, certain facets of the welfare state, as they developed in Qu\u00e9bec in the 1960s, became nationalized by virtue of Qu\u00e9bec's acceptance and promotion. This would include [[rural electrification]] and healthcare initiatives undertaken by [[Tommy Douglas]] in [[Saskatchewan]] twenty years earlier.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:PlaceDArmes by Msteckiw.jpg|thumb|The hill leading to [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal, an important historic site of French Canada]]\n\nThe Quiet Revolution began with the enacted [[Parti lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec|Liberal]] provincial government of [[Jean Lesage]], who was elected in the June [[1960 Quebec general election|1960 provincial election]], shortly after the death of Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], whose tenure was known by some as the [[Grande Noirceur]] (Great Darkness), but viewed by conservatives as epitomizing a religiously and culturally pure Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the government of Qu\u00e9bec was controlled by the conservative Duplessis, leader of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] party. Not all the Catholic Church supported Duplessis - some Catholic unions and members of the clergy criticized him, including Montreal Archbishop [[Joseph Charbonneau]] - but the bulk of the small-town and rural clergy supported him.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\">{{cite book |last=Behiels |first=Michael |title=Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/preludetoquebecs0000behi |url-access=registration |date=1985 |publisher=McGill}}</ref> Some quoted the Union Nationale slogan ''Le ciel est bleu, l'enfer est rouge'' (The sky (Heaven) is blue, Hell is red) as a reference to the colours of the Union Nationale (blue) and the Liberals (red), the latter accused often of being pro-communist.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} [[Radio-Canada]], the newspaper ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and political journal ''[[Cit\u00e9 Libre]]'' were [[intellectual]] forums for critics of the Duplessis government.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\" />\n\nPrior to the Quiet Revolution, the province's natural resources were developed mainly by foreign investors.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} As an example, the process of mining iron ore was developed by the US-based [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]].

The 1949 [[Asbestos Strike]] found Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois miners united against a nationalist foreign corporation.

In 1963, in conjunction with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own ''R\u00e9gie des Rentes du Qu\u00e9bec'' (RRQ, Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan); universal contributions came into effect in 1966. The [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ, Qu\u00e9bec Deposit and Investment Fund) was created in 1965 to manage the considerable revenues generated by the RRQ and to provide the capital necessary for various projects in the public and private sectors.\n\nA new labour code (''Code du Travail'') was adopted in 1964. It made unionizing much easier and gave public employees the right to strike.

A small faction of Marxist sovereignists began terrorist actions as the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]], the zenith of their activities being the 1970 [[October Crisis]], during which British diplomat [[James Cross]] as well as Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] were both kidnapped by FLQ cells, with Laporte eventually being killed.<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 321\" />\n\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has twice led the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois people through unsuccessful referendums, the first in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] on the question of political sovereignty with economic association to Canada (also known as [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty association]]),<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 327\" /> and the second in [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]] on full sovereignty.<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 354\" />\n\nIn 1977, during their first term in office, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois enacted the [[Charter of the French Language]], known more commonly as Bill 101, whose goal is to protect the French language by making it the language of business in Qu\u00e9bec, as well as restricting the use of English on signs. The bill also restricted the eligibility for elementary and high school students to attend school in English, allowing this only for children of parents who had studied in English in Qu\u00e9bec. Children may also be eligible for English education if their parents or grandparents received a certain amount of English education outside of the province (ex. another Canadian province).

Though the improvements made to Qu\u00e9bec society during this era make it seem like an extremely innovative period, it has been posited that these changes follow a logical revolutionary movement occurring throughout North America in the 1960s. Noted Qu\u00e9bec historian {{interlanguage link|Jacques Rouillard|fr|vertical-align=sup}} took this [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec\u2019s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.<ref name=\"Jacques Rouillard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=Winter 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d\u2019\u00e9tudes canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral arguments support this view. From an economic perspective, Quebec\u2019s manufacturing sector had seen important growth since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Buoyed by significant manufacturing demand during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the Qu\u00e9bec economy was already expanding before the events of the Quiet Revolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant?

He notes the popularity enjoyed by federal Liberal Prime Minister [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] as well as the Premiership of [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]] as examples of Qu\u00e9bec Liberalism prior to the events of the Quiet Revolution. The Godbout administration was extremely innovative. Its notable achievements include nationalizing the electricity distribution network of the city of Montreal, granting universal suffrage, instituting mandatory schooling until the age of 14 and establishing various social programs in Qu\u00e9bec.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant?
