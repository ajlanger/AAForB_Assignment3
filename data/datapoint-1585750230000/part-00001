In some they are seen as ominous and in others they are seen as auspicious. Twins in mythology are often cast as two halves of the same whole, sharing a bond deeper than that of ordinary siblings, or seen as fierce rivals. They can represent another aspect of the self, a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], or a [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]. However, twins can also reflect a complete opposition of the other, such as the \"civilized\" [[Gilgamesh]], and the \"wild\" [[Enkidu]]; or in the commonly known instance of good and evil twin identities.\n\n\nTwins can also be shown as having special powers and deep bonds. In Greek mythology, [[Castor and Pollux]] share a bond so strong that when Castor dies, Pollux gives up half of his immortality to be with his brother. This etiologically explains why their constellation, the Dioskouroi or Gemini, is only seen during one half of the year, as the twins split their time between the underworld and Mount Olympus. In an aboriginal tale, the same constellation represents the twin lizards who created the plants and animals and saved women from evil spirits. Another example of this strong bond shared between twins would be the [[Ibeji]] twins within African mythology. Ibeji twins are viewed as one soul shared between two bodies. If one of the twins die, the parents then create a doll that portrays the body of the deceased child, so the soul of the deceased can remain intact for the living twin. Without the creation of the doll, the living twin is almost destined for death because it is believed to be missing half of its soul.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title=Kanopy|last=Flatley|first=Robert|doi = 10.5260/cca.199204}}</ref>\n\n==By culture==\n\n===African (Nigerian)===\n* [[Mawu]]-Lisa - Twins representing moon and sun, respectively. \n* [[Yemaja]] - Mother of all life on earth. \n*[[Aganju]] - Twin and husband of Yemaja<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Ibeji]] - Twins of joy and happiness.
