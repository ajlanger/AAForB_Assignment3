'''''[[Smurfette]]'''''\n| Schtroumpfette\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Lucille Bliss]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Katy Perry]] ([[The Smurfs (film)|Movie 1]] and [[The Smurfs 2|2]])<br>[[Demi Lovato]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Smurfette is a female Smurf who was created by [[Gargamel]]. She originally had black hair, though when [[Papa Smurf]] made her good, her hair became blond. Before the smurflings created Sassette, Smurfette was the only female smurf in the Smurf village. Most of the time Smurfette is portrayed as an object of admiration of many other Smurfs, since she is the only female Smurf constantly in the village. She is usually hopeless in times of danger and sometimes thinks she knows it all, yet has a caring side as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2. '''''[[Papa Smurf]]'''''\n| Grand Schtroumpf\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Don Messick]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Jonathan Winters]] (Movie 1 and 2)<br>[[Mandy Patinkin]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Papa Smurf is the leader and [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] of the Smurfs and can be easily distinguished by his red clothes, bushy white moustache and beard. The Smurfs turn to Papa Smurf when things go wrong. Papa Smurf is skilled in making magical spells and potions. He is much older than the other Smurfs (except for Grandpa and Nanny, who are older than Papa). Papa Smurf often serves the other Smurfs with his knowledge and wisdom and usually devises a plan for how to get out of trouble or to save the Smurf village from attacks by Gargamel. Unlike the other male Smurfs, Papa Smurf's trousers and hat are red instead of white.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3. '''''Hefty Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Costaud\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Michael Sorich]] (''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>[[Frank Welker]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Gary Basaraba]] (Movie 1 and 2)<br>[[Joe Manganiello]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Hefty Smurf has incredible strength and often is seen doing a lot of the heavy work in the village. He also has a tattoo on his right arm (or sometimes both of his arms) of a red heart with an arrow through it. His favorite activity is lifting weights and doing other forms of exercise, and is often the one to kick Brainy out of the village whenever he is boasting. Hefty takes pride in being tough, sometimes doing it just for attention.\n\nPapa appoints Hefty as the leader of the Smurfs in season 3: Handy's Kite. In several episodes, Papa selects Hefty and Handy as leaders of separate teams in dangerous missions (season 1: Smurfette's Dancing Shoes; season 4: Hopping Cough Smurfs).\n\nIn ''The Lost Village'', he is one of the four main Smurf protagonists and is in love with Smurfette. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4. '''''Brainy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf \u00e0 Lunettes\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]] (''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>[[Danny Goldman]] and [[Barry Gordon]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Fred Armisen]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Danny Pudi]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Brainy Smurf considers himself the most intelligent Smurf in the village and an expert on everything, although his actual knowledge is questionable at best; often, his attempts to help in a given situation lead to even more problems. He can be distinguished from the others by the large glasses he wears. He also has archived his self-perceived wit and wisdom in several volumes of books entitled \"The Quotations of Brainy Smurf\". The Smurfs most often respond to his self-righteous preaching by either tossing him out of the village, clobbering him with a club (usually off screen) or simply ignoring him. His vices aside, Brainy is a good, loyal Smurf who can be counted on when the need arises, and more than once \u2013 without thinking about it \u2013 ends up doing the right thing. His original name translates to \"Smurf with Glasses\".\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 5. '''''Grouchy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Grognon\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] (Cartoon)<br>[[George Lopez]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Jake Johnson]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Grouchy Smurf is the [[misanthrope|misanthropic]] grouch of the Smurf village. His catchphrase is \"I hate (something somebody else mentions)\" yet it is shown during the show that he is a good observer and notices kindness in others even if he is not playing active role in an event. Even though Grouchy Smurf portrays a role of a moaner within the group, he mostly wishes others to be happy and successful in order to get out of a problematic situation. Grouchy usually has a scowl on his face. In the comics version he was originally a normal Smurf, changed only when bitten by a Bzz fly in the comic story \"The Black Smurfs\" (adapted into English as \"The Purple Smurfs\").\n\nIn the cartoon version, he seems to have always have been a grouch. Despite his grouchiness, he has a soft spot for Baby Smurf and the Smurflings.\n\nIn the movie, his grouchiness is implied to be from insecurity.\n\nIn Movie 2, he tries to become Positive Smurf, but bad things keep happening to him.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6. '''''Clumsy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Maladroit\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[William Callaway]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Anton Yelchin]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Jack McBrayer]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Clumsy Smurf is a somewhat dimwitted yet amiable Smurf. In some dangerous situations he is also revealed to be quite brave too. He is distinguished in the cartoon series by his baggy clothing (hat hanging over his eyebrows) which adds to his clumsy appearance (his clothing is normal in the comics).\n\nIn the animated series, Clumsy speaks in a variety of [[Southern American English]].\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 7. '''''Greedy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Gourmand\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies 1 and 2\n| [[Hamilton Camp]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Kenan Thompson]] (Movie 1 and 2)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Greedy is an exceptionally gluttonous Smurf. He has an exceptional interest in eating cakes and other pastry. Greedy usually cannot seem to help himself and he is often chased by Chef Smurf for stealing snacks and food.\n\nIn the cartoon series, this character was combined with that of Chef Smurf, where he enjoys baking and cooking, but eventually ends up eating his own creations, hence the name. He wears a [[Chef's uniform|chef's toque and apron]] in the comics.\n\nIn the cartoon, instead of an apron he often wears a napkin around his neck.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8. '''''Jokey Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Farceur\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[June Foray]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Paul Reubens]] (Movies)<br>[[Gabriel Iglesias]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Jokey is the village prankster. In the TV cartoon series, Jokey Smurf almost always used the same form of \"joke\"; yellow- and red-wrapped present boxes that he offers to his victims, saying that it is a \"surprise\". When opened, the \"present\" box explodes with a sizable quantity of black smoke which blackens the receiver's face (or entire body depending on the explosion's size). Gargamel is naturally a favorite target, and Brainy is as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9. '''''Chef Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Cuisinier\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies 1 and 2\n| [[Wolfgang Puck]] (Movie)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Chef Smurf is the Smurf village's [[chef]]. He knows dozens of recipes and cooks many dishes. He always wears his toque blanche (white chef's hat). In the cartoon series, Chef Smurf and Greedy Smurf are combined into the same character. In Volume 11, a Smurf is called ''Schtroumpf Gourmand'', who looks just like ''Schtroumpf cuisinier'' (wearing a toque blanche, neckerchief and apron). In Volume 23, ''Schtroumpf Gourmand'' is shown wearing the normal Smurf outfit (like he has in all other volumes) and ''Schtroumpf Cuisinier'' again wearing the chef outfit, so Volume 12 may have just been a mistake.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10. '''''Vanity Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Coquet\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Alan Oppenheimer]] (Cartoon)<br>[[John Oliver (entertainer)|John Oliver]] (Movie)<br>[[Tituss Burgess]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Vanity Smurf is the epitome of a [[Narcissism|narcissist]]. He has a flower in his hat, and he often holds a hand mirror, staring into his own reflection, which he kisses often. He thinks he is the best-looking of all of the Smurfs.\n\nIn Movie 2, Vanity becomes Commando Smurf.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 11. '''''Handy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Bricoleur\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Jeff Foxworthy]] (Movie)<br>[[Bret Marnell]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Handy Smurf (depicted as wearing overalls, a visor attached to the front of his cap, and with a pencil above his ear) is the [[handyman]] of the Smurfs. He helps fix things in the village and is known for his amazing technological inventions. He is the [[Invention|inventor]] of Clockwork Smurf and Clockwork Smurfette.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12. '''''Scaredy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Peureux\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| [[Alan Young]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Scaredy Smurf easily gets scared by anything, whether it is a small insect or the noise of a storm. He is often teased by the other Smurfs because of this. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 13. '''''Tracker Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Traqueur\n| Cartoon\n| [[Henry Polic II]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Tracker Smurf is a Smurf who is exclusive to the cartoon. He wears a small red feather in his cap and sometimes carries a walking stick. He is an excellent outdoorsman and [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]]. He also possesses an excellent sense of smell capable of locating [[truffles]] growing underground. In season 2: A Mere Truffle, he receives the Brainy treatment (thrown away or kicked away and lands on his head).\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 14. '''''Sloppy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Sale\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| [[Marshall Efron]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Sloppy Smurf is a filthy Smurf with a passion for dirt, garbage, and rotten fruit. His face is perpetually grimy, his hat is grubby and disheveled, and one of his loose stockings is perpetually torn, revealing his toes. Sloppy owns a pet fly named Fly, whom he sometimes walks on a leash and has taught to do tricks like a dog.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 15. '''''Harmony Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Musicien\n| Comics + Cartoon\n|[[Hamilton Camp]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Harmony Smurf is a [[musician]] who especially loves to play the trumpet, although his musical ability shows a total lack of harmony (somewhat like the singing of a certain [[List of Asterix characters#Cacofonix|fictional Armorican bard]], or [[Johan and Peewit#Characters|Johan's blonde-haired, diminutive sidekick]]). Harmony is usually asked to stop playing his trumpet as soon as he gets started. Some English editions name him as Rocker Smurf.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 16. '''''Painter Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Peintre\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movie (cameo)\n| [[William Callaway]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Painter Smurf is a brilliant [[artist]] and is active in most [[visual arts]].

Due to the interference of the Smurfs as Gargamel keeps claiming, the baron called the wedding off. This caused Gargamel to be dealt with by his mother when they get home. When Madame Lavinia states that she still would like to be paid her commission for this involvement, Gargame's mother states that her son \"will pay.\"\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Corbelius'''''\n|\n| Comics\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Corbelius is a black crow who is Gargamel's other pet in the comics, appearing far less frequently than Azrael. He serves Gargamel primarily in delivering letters, usually threats or ransom demands to the Smurfs. Unlike Azrael, Corbelius does not seem to take any malicious pleasure in what he does; if anything, he seems indifferent.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Monty'''''\n|\n| Movie ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]''\n|| [[Dee Bradley Baker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Monty is a vulture-like bird who is Gargamel's other pet in the ''Lost Village'' movie. Monty seems to be Gargamel's favorite, even though he seems like a lesser intellect, which irritates Azrael to no end. Monty does have a mean streak and can get quite angry, but seems more content with being dopey. Monty bears an uncanny resemblance to the titular creature from the episode The Howlibird.\n|}\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Original French name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Appears in\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Voiced by\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''[[Johan and Peewit]]'''''\n| Johan et Pirlouit\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| Sir Johan: [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>Pewitt: [[Frank Welker]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Johan is a young human [[squire]] and [[Page (servant)|page boy]] of an unnamed king near the Smurf village.

He also frequently breaks into Gargamel's hovel and eats his food and also eats rocks (which he likes dipped in slime). He is friends with whoever may be offering him something in exchange.

At first, they believed that the only thing worse than a Wartmonger was a Smurf. After being convinced that Smurfs are not actually hairy, red-eyed monsters as they had always believed, they befriended the Smurfs.

They are a married sorcerer and sorceress who love each other, yet as their surname implies, they frequently get into arguments during which they turn each other into all kinds of creepy things, then kiss and make up. They are good friends with Papa Smurf, Homnibus, and Peewit.

Flowerbell initially agrees, but grows to regret the deal, especially when Papa Smurf falls so seriously in love with her that he actually proposes marriage, despite misgivings from the other Smurfs. In the end, although Flowerbell does go through with the deal, she ends up rescuing Papa Smurf from Lord Balthazar with the help of the other Smurfs. Flowerbell also makes a cameo appearance in ''Smurfily Ever After'', as a guest at Woody and Laconia's wedding.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Melina'''''\n| Melina\n| Cartoon\n| N/A\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Like Brenda, Melina is a good little child witch who appears in a Season 7 episode of the cartoon series, \"Sassette's Bewitching Friendship\".

She originally had black hair, though when [[Papa Smurf]] made her good, her hair became blond. Before the smurflings created Sassette, Smurfette was the only female smurf in the Smurf village. Most of the time Smurfette is portrayed as an object of admiration of many other Smurfs, since she is the only female Smurf constantly in the village. She is usually hopeless in times of danger and sometimes thinks she knows it all, yet has a caring side as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2. '''''[[Papa Smurf]]'''''\n| Grand Schtroumpf\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Don Messick]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Jonathan Winters]] (Movie 1 and 2)<br>[[Mandy Patinkin]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Papa Smurf is the leader and [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] of the Smurfs and can be easily distinguished by his red clothes, bushy white moustache and beard. The Smurfs turn to Papa Smurf when things go wrong. Papa Smurf is skilled in making magical spells and potions. He is much older than the other Smurfs (except for Grandpa and Nanny, who are older than Papa). Papa Smurf often serves the other Smurfs with his knowledge and wisdom and usually devises a plan for how to get out of trouble or to save the Smurf village from attacks by Gargamel. Unlike the other male Smurfs, Papa Smurf's trousers and hat are red instead of white.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3. '''''Hefty Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Costaud\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Michael Sorich]] (''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>[[Frank Welker]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Gary Basaraba]] (Movie 1 and 2)<br>[[Joe Manganiello]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Hefty Smurf has incredible strength and often is seen doing a lot of the heavy work in the village. He also has a tattoo on his right arm (or sometimes both of his arms) of a red heart with an arrow through it. His favorite activity is lifting weights and doing other forms of exercise, and is often the one to kick Brainy out of the village whenever he is boasting. Hefty takes pride in being tough, sometimes doing it just for attention.\n\nPapa appoints Hefty as the leader of the Smurfs in season 3: Handy's Kite. In several episodes, Papa selects Hefty and Handy as leaders of separate teams in dangerous missions (season 1: Smurfette's Dancing Shoes; season 4: Hopping Cough Smurfs).\n\nIn ''The Lost Village'', he is one of the four main Smurf protagonists and is in love with Smurfette. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4.

He can be distinguished from the others by the large glasses he wears. He also has archived his self-perceived wit and wisdom in several volumes of books entitled \"The Quotations of Brainy Smurf\". The Smurfs most often respond to his self-righteous preaching by either tossing him out of the village, clobbering him with a club (usually off screen) or simply ignoring him. His vices aside, Brainy is a good, loyal Smurf who can be counted on when the need arises, and more than once \u2013 without thinking about it \u2013 ends up doing the right thing. His original name translates to \"Smurf with Glasses\".\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 5. '''''Grouchy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Grognon\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] (Cartoon)<br>[[George Lopez]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Jake Johnson]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Grouchy Smurf is the [[misanthrope|misanthropic]] grouch of the Smurf village. His catchphrase is \"I hate (something somebody else mentions)\" yet it is shown during the show that he is a good observer and notices kindness in others even if he is not playing active role in an event. Even though Grouchy Smurf portrays a role of a moaner within the group, he mostly wishes others to be happy and successful in order to get out of a problematic situation. Grouchy usually has a scowl on his face. In the comics version he was originally a normal Smurf, changed only when bitten by a Bzz fly in the comic story \"The Black Smurfs\" (adapted into English as \"The Purple Smurfs\").\n\nIn the cartoon version, he seems to have always have been a grouch. Despite his grouchiness, he has a soft spot for Baby Smurf and the Smurflings.\n\nIn the movie, his grouchiness is implied to be from insecurity.\n\nIn Movie 2, he tries to become Positive Smurf, but bad things keep happening to him.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6. '''''Clumsy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Maladroit\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[William Callaway]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Anton Yelchin]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Jack McBrayer]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Clumsy Smurf is a somewhat dimwitted yet amiable Smurf. In some dangerous situations he is also revealed to be quite brave too. He is distinguished in the cartoon series by his baggy clothing (hat hanging over his eyebrows) which adds to his clumsy appearance (his clothing is normal in the comics).\n\nIn the animated series, Clumsy speaks in a variety of [[Southern American English]].\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 7. '''''Greedy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Gourmand\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies 1 and 2\n| [[Hamilton Camp]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Kenan Thompson]] (Movie 1 and 2)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Greedy is an exceptionally gluttonous Smurf. He has an exceptional interest in eating cakes and other pastry. Greedy usually cannot seem to help himself and he is often chased by Chef Smurf for stealing snacks and food.\n\nIn the cartoon series, this character was combined with that of Chef Smurf, where he enjoys baking and cooking, but eventually ends up eating his own creations, hence the name. He wears a [[Chef's uniform|chef's toque and apron]] in the comics.\n\nIn the cartoon, instead of an apron he often wears a napkin around his neck.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8. '''''Jokey Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Farceur\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[June Foray]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Paul Reubens]] (Movies)<br>[[Gabriel Iglesias]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Jokey is the village prankster. In the TV cartoon series, Jokey Smurf almost always used the same form of \"joke\"; yellow- and red-wrapped present boxes that he offers to his victims, saying that it is a \"surprise\". When opened, the \"present\" box explodes with a sizable quantity of black smoke which blackens the receiver's face (or entire body depending on the explosion's size). Gargamel is naturally a favorite target, and Brainy is as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9. '''''Chef Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Cuisinier\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies 1 and 2\n| [[Wolfgang Puck]] (Movie)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Chef Smurf is the Smurf village's [[chef]]. He knows dozens of recipes and cooks many dishes. He always wears his toque blanche (white chef's hat). In the cartoon series, Chef Smurf and Greedy Smurf are combined into the same character.

Azrael shares Gargamel's distinctive laugh. Azrael was originally female in the comic books, but was changed to a male in the cartoon show and returned as a male in later comics and in the movies. In one episode of the series, Azrael got so tired of Gargamel treating him cruelly that he turned against his master.\nHowever, in the movies, he still remains loyal to Gargamel, although he laughs at his master whenever he gets humiliated or hurt.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Hogatha Griffin The Evil Witch'''''\n| Hogatha\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| [[Janet Waldo]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Hogatha is a character who was created for the television cartoon series, but has appeared in at least one of the comics for the magazine, which has often borrowed stories from episodes of the show. She is an evil, ugly [[Witchcraft|witch]] who uses her magic to lure unsuspecting suitors and occasionally cause trouble for the Smurfs. Hogatha snorts loudly with her large wart-covered nose. She thinks she is beautiful, although she is actually quite ugly and wears a red wig to cover her baldness. She rides on a long-suffering vulture whose name tends to vary from one episode to another, but the most frequent one is Harold. She and Gargamel dislike each other, and she often refers to him as \"Garglesmell\". Hogatha used a spell to disguise herself as a Smurf who constantly snorts and causes trouble, under the name '''Snorty Smurf''', in the first-season episode of the TV series \"The Fake Smurf\" (in the book version of the story, Gargamel is the one who changes himself into a Smurf). Regardless of being somehow vain at times during the show, Hogatha seeks to achieve acceptance from others and actively seeks love, showing a good side of her nature.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Lord Balthazar'''''\n| Lord Balthazar\n| Cartoon\n| [[Keene Curtis]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Lord Balthazar is Gargamel's [[godparent|godfather]].

A nasty, irredeemable woman as ugly as she is evil, she lives in a gloomy castle all alone, except for an unnamed talking pet toucan and a manservant named Reeves who also drives her carriage. Her backstory was revealed in a number of episodes. In season 3's \"The Tears of a Smurf,\" it is revealed she once married a nobleman, by whom she had a daughter named Priscilla. Chlorhydris then became insanely jealous over her husband loving her daughter more than he loved her. She caused her husband's disappearance and Priscilla, who was just a toddler at that time, grew up in a castle without love. Enraged when a young prince fell in love with her daughter, Chlorhydris used her malignant magic to cause the young man to also disappear and put a curse of ugliness on Priscilla to keep anyone else from falling in love with her. In the season 7 episode \"Chlorhydris' Lost Love,\" it is revealed that she was once kind and caring, but became hateful when her true love was stolen away from her.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Nemesis'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n|[[Frank Welker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Nemesis is a sinister, hiccupping creature shrouded in a purple robe. He is an evil wizard like Gargamel, only much more powerful. He is constantly trying to steal the Long-Life Stone, which is the magical artifact that grants the Smurfs their extremely long lifespans. He was once a human but after a magical accident, he became so grotesque that people were horrified at the sight of his face, so he kept his hood over it.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Scruple'''''\n| Scrupule\n| Cartoon\n| [[Brenda Vaccaro]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Scruple is Gargamel's nephew and apprentice. Scruple was expelled from a school for wizards and lives with his uncle Gargamel as kind of an indentured servant, even though neither one enjoys being with the other.

He shows his uncle little respect, often calling him \"Gargie\" to his face.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Count Gregorian'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Paul Winchell]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Count Gregorian is an evil wizard who only appeared in the Season 2 episode \"The Raven Wizard\". He was originally thought to be Princess Sabina's new [[tutor]], but it was revealed that he was the legendary Raven Wizard, cursed with the head of a [[raven]] when the temporary spell to restore his human head wore off. He kidnapped Sabina, whose beauty he needed to restore his human face with the aid of a magical gem called the Heart Diamond, even though she would be drained of her life's energy as a result. He failed when Johan and Peewit entered his castle, the latter causing the Heart Diamond to explode, turning the wizard completely into a ravenr.

He captured Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Clumsy Smurf and Brainy Smurf to entertain his master King Argon and his knights on the king's birthday. He then turned them into frogs so that he could steal the king's gold. When the other Smurfs entered the castle to free the captured Smurfs, Papa Smurf turned him into a frog, where he now spends his days eating flies, and turned King Argon and the knights back to normal. He is similar in trait to Gargamel and Count Gregorian in that they are evil wizards and voiced by Paul Winchell (though Count Gregorian and Mordain are not actually related to Gargamel).\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Lady Imperia'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" |The evil aunt and guardian of the boy Prince/King Gerard, Lady Imperia appears only in the Season 1 cartoon episode \"The Clockwork Smurf\", in which she and her henchman Thorick have locked her nephew up in a dungeon cell, pretending to his subjects that he is ill and has to be isolated, giving her the excuse to rule in his place as [[regent]]. She plans to eventually give the false news that Gerard is dead so that she can rule permanently, leaving her nephew to rot in his cell. The Smurfs and Clockwork Smurf help Gerard to escape and expose her and she is banished from the kingdom, never to return. Although other equally evil relatives of Gerard, namely his uncle Sir Leopold in \"Return of the Clockwork Smurf\" and his cousin Malcolm the Mean in \"The Noble Stag\", have tried to take the boy king's throne instead.\n|-\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''The Wartmongers'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Will Ryan]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The Wartmongers are little [[toad]]-like creatures who live in the muck and slime of Creepy Deepy Swamp and often cause the Smurfs problems. They consider having more warts than others as a source of pride. They like ripping the wings off of the Pussiwillow Pixies, and, like the Pixies, at first think that Smurfs are hairy, red-eyed monsters. The leader of the Wartmongers is '''King Bullrush''' (voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]) who commands his minions to do his bidding.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Evelyn'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Ruta Lee]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Evelyn is a glamorous but evil [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]] who only appears in the Smurfs television cartoon show episode \"Gargamel's Sweetheart\". She rides around in a carriage with her pet black [[weasel]] Satin, which she keeps draped around her shoulders like a fur stole, and she extorts people with her magic wand to surrender all their money or valuables. Gargamel falls in love with her and tries unsuccessfully to catch her interest by pretending to be a powerful, rich sorcerer. She does feign a mutual attraction to him when he claims he knows how to make gold, and agrees to help him catch Smurfs to do so. The Smurfs outsmart them though, and she ends up dropping both her pretense and Gargamel like a hot potato.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''\"Mummy\" (a.k.a.

She occasionally makes unannounced visits to her son, usually to berate him over his inability to catch the Smurfs. Also when she visits, she insists on doing the cooking at which she is terrible as both her son and Azrael can attest. She also hates cats and always throws Azrael out of Gargamel's hovel when she arrives to visit. On one occasion, she and Madame Lavinia tried to get Gargamel to be a suitor to a baron's daughter named Andiria. Due to the interference of the Smurfs as Gargamel keeps claiming, the baron called the wedding off. This caused Gargamel to be dealt with by his mother when they get home. When Madame Lavinia states that she still would like to be paid her commission for this involvement, Gargame's mother states that her son \"will pay.\"\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Corbelius'''''\n|\n| Comics\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Corbelius is a black crow who is Gargamel's other pet in the comics, appearing far less frequently than Azrael. He serves Gargamel primarily in delivering letters, usually threats or ransom demands to the Smurfs. Unlike Azrael, Corbelius does not seem to take any malicious pleasure in what he does; if anything, he seems indifferent.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Monty'''''\n|\n| Movie ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]''\n|| [[Dee Bradley Baker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Monty is a vulture-like bird who is Gargamel's other pet in the ''Lost Village'' movie. Monty seems to be Gargamel's favorite, even though he seems like a lesser intellect, which irritates Azrael to no end. Monty does have a mean streak and can get quite angry, but seems more content with being dopey. Monty bears an uncanny resemblance to the titular creature from the episode The Howlibird.\n|}\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Original French name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Appears in\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Voiced by\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''[[Johan and Peewit]]'''''\n| Johan et Pirlouit\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| Sir Johan: [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>Pewitt: [[Frank Welker]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Johan is a young human [[squire]] and [[Page (servant)|page boy]] of an unnamed king near the Smurf village.

It was in a ''Johan and Peewit'' adventure published in 1958 that the Smurfs were first introduced. The Smurfs would appear in some of the later adventures of Johan and Peewit, as well as their own series. In the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series during the second season, Johan and Peewit were occasionally featured in stories which focused on the pair and the kingdom they protected. Johan rides a white horse named Bayard, and Peewit rides a goat named Biquette (Nanny in ''The Smurfs and the Magic Flute''). In the cartoon, Peewit sings in an off-key voice and is always hungry.

He also frequently breaks into Gargamel's hovel and eats his food and also eats rocks (which he likes dipped in slime). He is friends with whoever may be offering him something in exchange. In other words, he will either help Gargamel or help the Smurfs, depending on who is offering more in return (usually food).

After being convinced that Smurfs are not actually hairy, red-eyed monsters as they had always believed, they befriended the Smurfs. They became friends because the Smurfs saved them from being turned into the Wartmongers' slaves and getting their wings ripped off.
