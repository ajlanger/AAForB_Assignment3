The libraries in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], [[Long Island City, Queens|Long Island City]] and [[Ditmars, Queens|Steinway]] formed the Long Island City Public Library in 1896, becoming Queens' first multi-branch library. In 1901, shortly after the consolidation of Queens into [[City of Greater New York|New York City]], the city government proposed a new charter joining all libraries in Queens into the '''Queens Borough Public Library'''. All of the public libraries signed on, except for Flushing, which remained independent until 1903.<ref name=\"Queens Library 1937\">{{cite web | title=History | website=Queens Library | date=June 25, 1937 | url=http://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/history | access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref> The Queens Borough Public Library was officially incorporated in 1907.<ref>{{cite book | title=Journal of Proceedings | year=1907 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsUzAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA3290 | access-date=April 2, 2019 | page=3290}}</ref>\n\nDue to the wide variation in population density in Queens, in 1906, the Queens Borough Public Library established small branches in store-fronts and shopping areas under the Traveling Library program. With these branches, Queens Library grew swiftly, eventually opening major branches in almost every Queens neighborhood.\n\nThe original Central Library on Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica was opened in 1930 and expanded with [[Works Progress Administration]] funds in 1941. It was a splendid four-story Renaissance Revival building. In spite of its elegance, it was too small for the demand and was replaced by a new, more spacious facility in 1966, through the persistent efforts of the Library Director, Harold W. Tucker.\n[[File:Queens Borough; being a descriptive and illustrated book of the borough of Queens, city of Greater New York, setting forth its many advantages and possibilities as a section wherein to live, to work (14596366017).jpg|thumb|Original Far Rockaway branch, later destroyed by fire]]\n$240,000 donated by [[Andrew Carnegie]] was used for the construction of seven new [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]]  between 1904 and 1924 in the most heavily\u2014populated areas of the borough.
