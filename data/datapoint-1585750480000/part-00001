Virtual coins serve as the [[in-game currency]], which can be either purchased via the in-app shop or rewarded through various community actions such as having creations rated via stars. These coins can be used to buy a variety of themed building sets including original offerings, like Heroes of Aero, City Blocks, and Star Rangers, and \"models\", structures or other creations built by other players.\n\nBlocks are sorted into categories known as blocks, models, \"props\", textures, colors, \"Blocksters\", and action blocks. Certain blocks have a bronze, silver, or gold border around them that symbolizes their perceived rarity. Blocksters are blocks used to represent characters created by players. Action blocks, such as wheels and hinges, perform specific functions to make creations more dynamic or interactive. Other blocks, like props, serve to fit decorative needs.\n\nActions and sounds are behaviors players can use to add function to blocks. They are placed in a panel with infinite space to store all actions needed, although colors, textures, and any sound effect can be placed in the panel as well.\n\nPlayers have the option to purchase \u201cBlocksworld Premium\u201d which grants an infinite supply of various blocks and items, among other things.
