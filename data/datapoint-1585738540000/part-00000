The CAT is a new test for people who have acquired [[aphasia]], the impairment of language ability. The comprehensive assessment can be completed over one or two sessions. The test contains a cognitive screening, a language battery and a disability questionnaire. \nThe authors of the comprehensive aphasia test take account of current linguistic and psychological theory and other variable that impact aphasic performance. The CAT was published in 2005 and was the first new aphasia test in English for 20 years. \nThe test is designed to (1) screen for associated cognitive deficits,(2) assess language impairment in people with aphasia, (3) investigate the consequences of the aphasia on the individual's lifestyle and emotional well-being, and (4) monitor changes in the aphasia and its consequences over time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bruce | first1 = C. | last2 = Edmundson | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = \"Letting the CAT out of the bag: A review of the Comprehensive Aphasia Test.
