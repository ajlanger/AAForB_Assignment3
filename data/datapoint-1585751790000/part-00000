During this process, the parasite releases the toxic and soluble molecule [[heme]]. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP).

Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further [[biocrystallization]] of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function.

The effectiveness of chloroquine against ''P. falciparum'' has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.

During this process, the parasite releases the toxic and soluble molecule [[heme]]. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form [[hemozoin]], a nontoxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nChloroquine enters the red blood cell by simple diffusion, inhibiting the parasite cell and digestive vacuole. Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further [[biocrystallization]] of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function.

The effectiveness of chloroquine against ''P. falciparum'' has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.
