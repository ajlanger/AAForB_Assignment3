The United Nations has published a description of fair trade banana production which states, \"for banana producers this means they obtain a price which covers the cost of production and an additional price premium to be invested in social, environmental or quality improvements.\"<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/Y1767e.HTM#P25_1982 THE MARKET FOR \"FAIR-TRADE\" BANANAS]</ref>\n\n=== Banana farming in flood prone areas ===\nSand deposition from flood makes soil unsuitable for growing other food crops due to very low nutrient availability, low water holding capacity and poor physical attributes. Thus more time and effort is required to completely restore the land into its original state after the sand deposition. As a result, farmers face difficulties to go back to normalcy and sustain their life. There are various strategies developed so far to revitalize flood degraded soil. However, most of the strategies require higher initial investment and/or take longer time to restore due to which farmers are unable to generate income as before.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://answers.practicalaction.org/our-resources/item/banana-farming-in-flood-deposited-sandy-soil|title=Banana farming in flood deposited sandy soil|website=answers.practicalaction.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==== Method of establishing banana orchard in flood deposited sandy soil ====\n[[Banana]] can be grown in variety of soil. However, while planting in flood prone area and sand deposited soil, regular management practice should be slightly amended. If sand deposition is above 0.5 m and the area gets inundate for longer duration (more than 2-3 days) during monsoon, then such site should not be considered for banana plantation. These are the necessary things to be considered in each step of banana farming in flood affected area:\n\nI. Variety selection \n\nIn flood affected areas, there is always a high chance of banana plant being submerged in flood during monsoon. If it is fully submerged for more than two days, plant can eventually die. Therefore tall variety plants with deep root system should be planted in such areas. In Nepal, people usually grow malbhog variety of banana in the areas which are prone to annual flood but are not inundate for longer than three days. Malbhog variety grows up to the height of 5 m and root goes down to more than 1 m deep into the soil. Production is quiet lower compared to hybrid varieties but fetch good market price because of its taste.\n\nII. Propagation material \n\nIn Nepal, banana is propagated exclusively using suckers. Suckers are lateral shoot that develops from the rhizome near the mother plant and are categorically of two types, sword sucker and water sucker. Generally, sword suckers are preferred over water suckers as the plant developed from water suckers are weak and take longer to bear fruits. Sword suckers can be easily distinguished because of its well developed base with narrow sword shaped blades at the early stages. Two to four months old suckers from healthy and high yielding mother plant should be selected for [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://floodresilience.net/resources/item/banana-farming-in-flood-deposited-sandy-soil|title=Banana farming in flood deposited sandy soil - Flood Resilience Portal|website=floodresilience.net|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIII. Planting method \n\nBanana suckers are usually planted in a 0.2 to 0.25 m furrow or pit of size 0.6x0.6x0.6&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> at a depth of 0.3 m. But in flood affected areas, suckers should be planted in a pit of size more or less equal to 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>. The pit is filled with mixture of topsoil and farmyard manure at a 1:1 ratio and sucker is planted at 0.5 to 0.75&nbsp;m depth depending upon the height of sand above original ground level. A total of 2 x 3 m spacing should be maintained between the plants.\n\nIV. Crop management \n\n[[Intensive crop farming|Crop management]] begins with the planting, continues with crop maintenance during growth and development, and ends with crop harvest, storage and distribution. For good harvest, crop management strategy should be contextualized based on the soil type, topography, climate and availability and affordability of inputs.\n\n==Social aspects==\n===Early benefits in tribal/clanship culture===\nCertain [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[clan]]ships benefited from early development of intensive banana cultivation by expanding previously territorial land views into concepts of [[cooperative]] inter-clan trading relationships.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Kodesh\n  | first = Neil\n  | title = Networks of knowledge: clanship and collective well-being in buganda\n  | journal = The Journal of African History\n  | volume = 11\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 39\u201372\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | location = United Kingndom\n  | date = 2008-07-01\n  | doi = 10.1017/S0021853708003629 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Schoenbrun\n  | first = David L.\n  | title = Cattle herds and banana gardens: the historical geography of the western Great Lakes region, ca AD 800\u20131500\n  | journal = African Archaeological Review\n  | volume = 20\n  | pages = 75\u201383\n  | date = 2008-02-08}}\n</ref>\n\n===Labor conditions===\nLabor conditions in the banana industry have historically drawn attention both in criticism of the traditionally poor industry [[working conditions]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mlot | first1 = Christine | year = 2004 | title = Greening the World's Most Popular Fruit | url = | journal = National Wildlife | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201319 }}</ref> and more recently in attempts by labor advocacy groups and some producers to improve labor conditions.<ref>http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/research/researchcentres/CGLR/events/09012008.html</ref>\n\nWorkers on banana plantations in [[Central America]] have been exposed to [[pesticides]] which have been found to cause various health conditions including [[Infertility|sterility]]. Banana industry advocates maintain that exposure levels were too low to produce health issues, but juries in the [[U.S.|United States]] found [[Dole Food Company]] guilty of specific cases of worker sterility related to pesticide exposure in the late 1970s. One successful lawsuit presented evidence that Dole continued to use the pesticide [[DBCP]] on banana plantations in [[Nicaragua]] after the agent was found by the manufacturer to cause health problems and was banned in California in 1977. The jury found the chemical manufacturer, [[Dow Chemical]], 20% liable and Dole 80% liable because Dow had warned Dole of the dangers of [[aerial spraying]] in the presence of workers, yet evidence presented in court indicated Dole continued using the agent in close proximity to workers on its Nicaraguan banana plantations. Financial liability in the case was later stricken because of international jurisdiction issues, however the finding of culpability by the jury was left intact.<ref>{{cite court\n  |litigants=Tellez et al. v.

The United Nations has published a description of fair trade banana production which states, \"for banana producers this means they obtain a price which covers the cost of production and an additional price premium to be invested in social, environmental or quality improvements.\"<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/Y1767e.HTM#P25_1982 THE MARKET FOR \"FAIR-TRADE\" BANANAS]</ref>\n\n=== Banana farming in flood prone areas ===\nSand deposition from flood makes soil unsuitable for growing other food crops due to very low nutrient availability, low water holding capacity and poor physical attributes. Thus more time and effort is required to completely restore the land into its original state after the sand deposition. As a result, farmers face difficulties to go back to normalcy and sustain their life. There are various strategies developed so far to revitalize flood degraded soil. However, most of the strategies require higher initial investment and/or take longer time to restore due to which farmers are unable to generate income as before.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://answers.practicalaction.org/our-resources/item/banana-farming-in-flood-deposited-sandy-soil|title=Banana farming in flood deposited sandy soil|website=answers.practicalaction.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==== Method of establishing banana orchard in flood deposited sandy soil ====\n[[Banana]] can be grown in variety of soil. However, while planting in flood prone area and sand deposited soil, regular management practice should be slightly amended. If sand deposition is above 0.5 m and the area gets inundate for longer duration (more than 2-3 days) during monsoon, then such site should not be considered for banana plantation. These are the necessary things to be considered in each step of banana farming in flood affected area:\n\nI. Variety selection \n\nIn flood affected areas, there is always a high chance of banana plant being submerged in flood during monsoon. If it is fully submerged for more than two days, plant can eventually die. Therefore tall variety plants with deep root system should be planted in such areas. In Nepal, people usually grow malbhog variety of banana in the areas which are prone to annual flood but are not inundate for longer than three days. Malbhog variety grows up to the height of 5 m and root goes down to more than 1 m deep into the soil. Production is quiet lower compared to hybrid varieties but fetch good market price because of its taste.\n\nII. Propagation material \n\nIn Nepal, banana is propagated exclusively using suckers. Suckers are lateral shoot that develops from the rhizome near the mother plant and are categorically of two types, sword sucker and water sucker. Generally, sword suckers are preferred over water suckers as the plant developed from water suckers are weak and take longer to bear fruits. Sword suckers can be easily distinguished because of its well developed base with narrow sword shaped blades at the early stages. Two to four months old suckers from healthy and high yielding mother plant should be selected for [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://floodresilience.net/resources/item/banana-farming-in-flood-deposited-sandy-soil|title=Banana farming in flood deposited sandy soil - Flood Resilience Portal|website=floodresilience.net|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIII. Planting method \n\nBanana suckers are usually planted in a 0.2 to 0.25 m furrow or pit of size 0.6x0.6x0.6&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> at a depth of 0.3 m. But in flood affected areas, suckers should be planted in a pit of size more or less equal to 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>. The pit is filled with mixture of topsoil and farmyard manure at a 1:1 ratio and sucker is planted at 0.5 to 0.75&nbsp;m depth depending upon the height of sand above original ground level. A total of 2 x 3 m spacing should be maintained between the plants.\n\nIV. Crop management \n\n[[Intensive crop farming|Crop management]] begins with the planting, continues with crop maintenance during growth and development, and ends with crop harvest, storage and distribution. For good harvest, crop management strategy should be contextualized based on the soil type, topography, climate and availability and affordability of inputs.\n\n==Social aspects==\n===Early benefits in tribal/clanship culture===\nCertain [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[clan]]ships benefited from early development of intensive banana cultivation by expanding previously territorial land views into concepts of [[cooperative]] inter-clan trading relationships.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Kodesh\n  | first = Neil\n  | title = Networks of knowledge: clanship and collective well-being in buganda\n  | journal = The Journal of African History\n  | volume = 11\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 39\u201372\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | location = United Kingndom\n  | date = 2008-07-01\n  | doi = 10.1017/S0021853708003629 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Schoenbrun\n  | first = David L.\n  | title = Cattle herds and banana gardens: the historical geography of the western Great Lakes region, ca AD 800\u20131500\n  | journal = African Archaeological Review\n  | volume = 20\n  | pages = 75\u201383\n  | date = 2008-02-08}}\n</ref>\n\n===Labor conditions===\nLabor conditions in the banana industry have historically drawn attention both in criticism of the traditionally poor industry [[working conditions]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mlot | first1 = Christine | year = 2004 | title = Greening the World's Most Popular Fruit | url = | journal = National Wildlife | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201319 }}</ref> and more recently in attempts by labor advocacy groups and some producers to improve labor conditions.<ref>http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/research/researchcentres/CGLR/events/09012008.html</ref>\n\nWorkers on banana plantations in [[Central America]] have been exposed to [[pesticides]] which have been found to cause various health conditions including [[Infertility|sterility]]. Banana industry advocates maintain that exposure levels were too low to produce health issues, but juries in the [[U.S.|United States]] found [[Dole Food Company]] guilty of specific cases of worker sterility related to pesticide exposure in the late 1970s. One successful lawsuit presented evidence that Dole continued to use the pesticide [[DBCP]] on banana plantations in [[Nicaragua]] after the agent was found by the manufacturer to cause health problems and was banned in California in 1977. The jury found the chemical manufacturer, [[Dow Chemical]], 20% liable and Dole 80% liable because Dow had warned Dole of the dangers of [[aerial spraying]] in the presence of workers, yet evidence presented in court indicated Dole continued using the agent in close proximity to workers on its Nicaraguan banana plantations. Financial liability in the case was later stricken because of international jurisdiction issues, however the finding of culpability by the jury was left intact.<ref>{{cite court\n  |litigants=Tellez et al. v.

Henry was motivated to take Boulogne by the French giving aid to England's enemies in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. In 1543 he made a new alliance with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Spain]], whose Roman Catholic allegiances were, for a time, overruled by the political advantages of an alliance with England against France.\n\nIn early 1544, a large English force departed from the [[Pale of Calais]]. Later, this split into two parts, and one of them, under the [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]], marched to the coastal town of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and laid siege to it on 19 July. A few weeks later, Henry arrived to take command of the siege himself. The lower section of the town, fortified lightly, fell quickly to heavy bombardment, which continued through August. By September, the upper town was breached and taken, but the central castle still held out. The French garrison's firepower prevented any approach on foot, so the English dug tunnels under the castle, and the French surrendered on 13 September.\n\nHowever, the Emperor Charles V then made a separate peace with France, and the French attacked Boulogne in the Second Siege of Boulogne.\n\nOver the following years, neither England nor France found the strength to engage in all-out war with one another. French attempts to retake Boulogne failed, while English attempts to gain more territory around Calais and Boulogne also failed. Henry awaited a large French invasion fleet which never came, and subsequently much of England's military resources during his and his son's reigns were diverted to the [[Rough Wooing|war in Scotland]].\n\n== Second siege ==\n\nThe '''Second Siege of Boulogne''' was an engagement late in the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546]].  The Dauphin's army descended on [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]], forcing the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] to raise the siege; [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] himself left for England at the end of September 1544, ordering the Dukes of Norfolk and [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk]] to defend Boulogne.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 395\u2013396.</ref>  The two Dukes quickly proceeded to disobey this order: leaving some 4,000 men to defend the captured city, they withdrew the rest of the English army to Calais.<ref>Phillips, \"Testing the 'Mystery'\", 47; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 396\u2013397.</ref>  The English army, outnumbered, was now trapped in Calais; the Dauphin, left unopposed, concentrated his efforts on investing Boulogne.<ref>Elton, ''England Under the Tudors'', 195; Phillips, \"Testing the 'Mystery'\", 47, 51\u201352; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 397.</ref>  On 9 October, a French assault nearly captured the city, but was beaten back when the troops prematurely turned to looting.<ref>Arnold, ''Renaissance at War''; Phillips, \"Testing the 'Mystery'\", 48\u201350.</ref>\n\n==The English armoury and the conclusion of the siege in 1550==\n\n===Fortifications===\nAfter Henry VIII's personal visit to Boulogne on 18 September the English began fortifying their position. Boulogne had a high and low town, and the citadel of Boulogne was in the low town adjacent to the harbour near the mouth of the river Liane. To the north a Roman lighthouse called the 'Old Man' was fortified, and a new fort built between the Old Man and Boulogne in 1545 was called the 'Young Man.' The surveyor of these works was John Rogers who had been a master mason. The military engineer [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Richard Lee]] and [[Thomas Palmer (died 1553)|Thomas Palmer]], treasurer of [[Gu\u00eenes]], brought additional instructions directly from Henry VIII.  Another outlying fort was built on a hill to east from May 1546. Now called Mont Lambert, it was then called Boulemberg. However, Nicolas Arnold, the captain of Boulogne complained of its shortcomings; it held no well, or room for storage. It was abandoned in 1549 on the approach of a French army. The French fortified south of the Liane, building the Fort de Ch\u00e2tillon and Fort d'[[Outreau]]. The building of any new fortifications was supposed to have ceased under the Treaty of Camp (or Treaty of Ardres) made in June 1546. The treaty provided that the English would evacuate Boulogne in 1554 in return for 2,000,000 [[Crown (British coin)|crowns]].<ref>Colvin, Howard, ed., ''History of the King's Works'', vol. 3 part 1, (1975) 383\u2013393.</ref> The English possession of Boulogne was eventually compromised by the French construction of a fort at [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]], north of the town, which could blockade supplies.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 274 & note.</ref> Although records are incomplete, it is clear that large numbers of English labourers died or became sick during the works.

Most of their wheels and stocks were said to be rotten and decayed. The totals were; 4 cannons; 5 demi-cannons; 10 [[culverin]]s; 14 demi-culverins; 18 [[Saker (cannon)|sakers]]; 21 falcons, falconets, and chamber falcons; 25 great brass mortars; 19 small brass mortars; 9 iron mortars; 3 iron bombards; 3 iron cannon-perrier; 16 port-pieces; 24 [[Veuglaire|fowlers]]; 7 slings; 12 [[Breech-loading swivel guns|double bases]]; 54 shrimp bases; 114 privy bases; 2 robinets; and 73 [[Arquebus|brass hagbuts]]. The guns were in four positions; the Old Man; High Boulogne; Base Boulogne; and the Boulemberg (Mont Lambert).<ref>Starkey, David, ed., ''Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries (1998), 132, no. 6170-6188.</ref> When Boulogne was returned to France in March 1550, Edward VI noted that the guns too would be handed over. These included recently captured pieces and; 2 basilisks; 2 demi-cannon; 3 culverins; 2 demi-culverins; 3 sakers; 16 falcons; 94 arquebus a croc with wooden tails (muskets for fixed positions); and 21 iron guns.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966), 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Continuing conflict===\nThere was a truce between the French and English at Boulogne according to a treaty made between [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Francis I of France]] in March 1547.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign Edward VI'', (1861), 10, noted only; see ''Foedera'', vol. 15, (1725), 135, Latin.</ref> In June 1547, an international dispute arose over a wall the English were building at the harbour. The French claimed it was a new fortification in breach of truce under the Treaty of Camp, while the English maintained that it was merely a sea wall to protect the haven. In the diplomacy, this dispute was connected with arguments over English and French intentions and intervention at [[St Andrews Castle]] in Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 505\u20136, 511, 513, 522.</ref> In the summer of 1548, the French observed the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] was provided with a flanker and cannon; the English insisted it was merely to protect the workmen. French ships fired at it and the English returned fire.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign'', Edward VI, (1861), 352, Calais Papers 10 August 15498.</ref> [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] told [[Fran\u00e7ois van der Delft]] that the French were constructing forts at Boulogne in contravention of treaty in September 1548; in December the French managed to destroy two new outposts the English were building, and another fort nearer to [[Gu\u00eenes]] and Calais called Fort Fiennes.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish,'' vol. 9 (1912), 291, 326.</ref>\n\nA major attempt on Boulogne by the French was repulsed in May 1549. The Imperial ambassador, [[Simon Renard]], reported a failed assault on the fort at Boulemberg, or Mount Lambert. The French leader, [[Gaspard II de Coligny]], sieur de Ch\u00e2tillon, a nephew of the [[Anne de Montmorency|Constable of France]], set ladders against the fort at 2:00am but the alarm was sounded by members of the garrison who he believed he had successfully bribed. 200 French were killed. The English suspected treachery as four guns blew up on their first firing and around seventy men were absent without leave. The womenfolk in the fort were said to have saved the day. Some laughed at Ch\u00e2tillon, saying he had made his scaling ladders too short, although the action was well-conceived as the fort was crucial to the defence of the town. Moreover, the action was said to be in breach of treaty.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 373, 376\u2013377.</ref>\n\nEdward VI recorded this night assault in his chronicle, with a failed attempt to burn the ships in the harbour. In the summer, Coligny bombarded the pier with a battery of 20,000 shot, and blockaded the mouth of the haven with artillery. The English overran this artillery position and the French set up another which was less commanding. An attempt to foul the harbour with a hulk laden with stones also failed to inconvenience the English garrison.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966),12, 16.</ref>\n\n===English withdrawal===\nAlthough by the Treaty of Camp, the English had agreed to evacuate Boulogne in 1554, the town was returned to France in 1550 under the Treaty of Boulogne which also concluded the [[The Rough Wooing|war of Rough Wooing]] in Scotland. Simon Renard reported that the English captain accepted his order to surrender from the [[Privy Council]] with a sigh. [[Henry II of France]] formally entered the town on 16 May 1550. He stayed three days and visited the forts of the Boulemberg, [[Ambleteuse]], the Tower of [[Ardres]], the Great Fort and Fort Ch\u00e2tillon (also called Ch\u00e2tillon's garden). He was impressed with some of these recent fortification works and also with the English scheme for bringing freshwater to the town. Henry II determined to continue building the English [[star fort]] at Ambleteuse and the neighbouring work at [[Cap Gris Nez|Blackness]]. The French also admired the mole, which they called 'la Dunette,' and when completed Henry II compared it to a Roman work.<ref>de Rosny, A., ''M\u00e9moires de la societ\u00e9 acad\u00e9mique de Boulogne'' vol. 27, 'Documents in\u00e9dits, concernant les si\u00e8ges de Boulogne, 1548\u20131549' (1912), 533: quoted ''HKW'' (1975), 390.</ref> The [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne]], destroyed or badly damaged by the English, was to be rebuilt, Henry II gave the church a silver statue of Our Lady, and other nobles subscribed money.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 10, (1914) 92\u201393, 24 May 1550.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1544 Siege of Boulogne by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was depicted in the 4th season of the television series ''[[The Tudors]]''.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Portal|Italy|War}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Arnold, Thomas F.

Henry was motivated to take Boulogne by the French giving aid to England's enemies in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. In 1543 he made a new alliance with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Spain]], whose Roman Catholic allegiances were, for a time, overruled by the political advantages of an alliance with England against France.\n\nIn early 1544, a large English force departed from the [[Pale of Calais]]. Later, this split into two parts, and one of them, under the [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]], marched to the coastal town of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and laid siege to it on 19 July. A few weeks later, Henry arrived to take command of the siege himself. The lower section of the town, fortified lightly, fell quickly to heavy bombardment, which continued through August. By September, the upper town was breached and taken, but the central castle still held out. The French garrison's firepower prevented any approach on foot, so the English dug tunnels under the castle, and the French surrendered on 13 September.\n\nHowever, the Emperor Charles V then made a separate peace with France, and the French attacked Boulogne in the Second Siege of Boulogne.\n\nOver the following years, neither England nor France found the strength to engage in all-out war with one another. French attempts to retake Boulogne failed, while English attempts to gain more territory around Calais and Boulogne also failed. Henry awaited a large French invasion fleet which never came, and subsequently much of England's military resources during his and his son's reigns were diverted to the [[Rough Wooing|war in Scotland]].\n\n== Second siege ==\n\nThe '''Second Siege of Boulogne''' was an engagement late in the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546]].  The Dauphin's army descended on [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]], forcing the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] to raise the siege; [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] himself left for England at the end of September 1544, ordering the Dukes of Norfolk and [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk]] to defend Boulogne.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 395\u2013396.</ref>  The two Dukes quickly proceeded to disobey this order: leaving some 4,000 men to defend the captured city, they withdrew the rest of the English army to Calais.<ref>Phillips, \"Testing the 'Mystery'\", 47; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 396\u2013397.</ref>  The English army, outnumbered, was now trapped in Calais; the Dauphin, left unopposed, concentrated his efforts on investing Boulogne.<ref>Elton, ''England Under the Tudors'', 195; Phillips, \"Testing the 'Mystery'\", 47, 51\u201352; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 397.</ref>  On 9 October, a French assault nearly captured the city, but was beaten back when the troops prematurely turned to looting.<ref>Arnold, ''Renaissance at War'', \n#REDIRECT [[18]]\n0; Phillips, \"Testing the 'Mystery'\", 48\u201350.</ref>\n\n==The English armoury and the conclusion of the siege in 1550==\n\n===Fortifications===\nAfter Henry VIII's personal visit to Boulogne on 18 September the English began fortifying their position. Boulogne had a high and low town, and the citadel of Boulogne was in the low town adjacent to the harbour near the mouth of the river Liane. To the north a Roman lighthouse called the 'Old Man' was fortified, and a new fort built between the Old Man and Boulogne in 1545 was called the 'Young Man.' The surveyor of these works was John Rogers who had been a master mason. The military engineer [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Richard Lee]] and [[Thomas Palmer (died 1553)|Thomas Palmer]], treasurer of [[Gu\u00eenes]], brought additional instructions directly from Henry VIII.  Another outlying fort was built on a hill to east from May 1546. Now called Mont Lambert, it was then called Boulemberg. However, Nicolas Arnold, the captain of Boulogne complained of its shortcomings; it held no well, or room for storage. It was abandoned in 1549 on the approach of a French army. The French fortified south of the Liane, building the Fort de Ch\u00e2tillon and Fort d'[[Outreau]]. The building of any new fortifications was supposed to have ceased under the Treaty of Camp (or Treaty of Ardres) made in June 1546. The treaty provided that the English would evacuate Boulogne in 1554 in return for 2,000,000 [[Crown (British coin)|crowns]].<ref>Colvin, Howard, ed., ''History of the King's Works'', vol. 3 part 1, (1975) 383\u2013393.</ref> The English possession of Boulogne was eventually compromised by the French construction of a fort at [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]], north of the town, which could blockade supplies.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 274 & note.</ref> Although records are incomplete, it is clear that large numbers of English labourers died or became sick during the works. Of 1,200 men sent in January 1545, only 300 were still working in June.<ref>History of the King's Works, vol. 3 part 1 (1975), 392 citing ''Letters & Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 20 part 1, nos. 121, 925.</ref>\n\n===Armoury===\nThe guns of Boulogne were listed in the [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of English crown possessions]] taken after Henry VIII's death on 28 January 1547. Most of their wheels and stocks were said to be rotten and decayed. The totals were; 4 cannons; 5 demi-cannons; 10 [[culverin]]s; 14 demi-culverins; 18 [[Saker (cannon)|sakers]]; 21 falcons, falconets, and chamber falcons; 25 great brass mortars; 19 small brass mortars; 9 iron mortars; 3 iron bombards; 3 iron cannon-perrier; 16 port-pieces; 24 [[Veuglaire|fowlers]]; 7 slings; 12 [[Breech-loading swivel guns|double bases]]; 54 shrimp bases; 114 privy bases; 2 robinets; and 73 [[Arquebus|brass hagbuts]]. The guns were in four positions; the Old Man; High Boulogne; Base Boulogne; and the Boulemberg (Mont Lambert).<ref>Starkey, David, ed., ''Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries (1998), 132, no. 6170-6188.</ref> When Boulogne was returned to France in March 1550, Edward VI noted that the guns too would be handed over. These included recently captured pieces and; 2 basilisks; 2 demi-cannon; 3 culverins; 2 demi-culverins; 3 sakers; 16 falcons; 94 arquebus a croc with wooden tails (muskets for fixed positions); and 21 iron guns.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966), 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Continuing conflict===\nThere was a truce between the French and English at Boulogne according to a treaty made between [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Francis I of France]] in March 1547.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign Edward VI'', (1861), 10, noted only; see ''Foedera'', vol. 15, (1725), 135, Latin.</ref> In June 1547, an international dispute arose over a wall the English were building at the harbour. The French claimed it was a new fortification in breach of truce under the Treaty of Camp, while the English maintained that it was merely a sea wall to protect the haven. In the diplomacy, this dispute was connected with arguments over English and French intentions and intervention at [[St Andrews Castle]] in Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 505\u20136, 511, 513, 522.</ref> In the summer of 1548, the French observed the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] was provided with a flanker and cannon; the English insisted it was merely to protect the workmen. French ships fired at it and the English returned fire.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign'', Edward VI, (1861), 352, Calais Papers 10 August 15498.</ref> [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] told [[Fran\u00e7ois van der Delft]] that the French were constructing forts at Boulogne in contravention of treaty in September 1548; in December the French managed to destroy two new outposts the English were building, and another fort nearer to [[Gu\u00eenes]] and Calais called Fort Fiennes.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish,'' vol. 9 (1912), 291, 326.</ref>\n\nA major attempt on Boulogne by the French was repulsed in May 1549. The Imperial ambassador, [[Simon Renard]], reported a failed assault on the fort at Boulemberg, or Mount Lambert. The French leader, [[Gaspard II de Coligny]], sieur de Ch\u00e2tillon, a nephew of the [[Anne de Montmorency|Constable of France]], set ladders against the fort at 2:00am but the alarm was sounded by members of the garrison who he believed he had successfully bribed. 200 French were killed. The English suspected treachery as four guns blew up on their first firing and around seventy men were absent without leave. The womenfolk in the fort were said to have saved the day. Some laughed at Ch\u00e2tillon, saying he had made his scaling ladders too short, although the action was well-conceived as the fort was crucial to the defence of the town. Moreover, the action was said to be in breach of treaty.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 373, 376\u2013377.</ref>\n\nEdward VI recorded this night assault in his chronicle, with a failed attempt to burn the ships in the harbour. In the summer, Coligny bombarded the pier with a battery of 20,000 shot, and blockaded the mouth of the haven with artillery. The English overran this artillery position and the French set up another which was less commanding. An attempt to foul the harbour with a hulk laden with stones also failed to inconvenience the English garrison.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966),12, 16.</ref>\n\n===English withdrawal===\nAlthough by the Treaty of Camp, the English had agreed to evacuate Boulogne in 1554, the town was returned to France in 1550 under the Treaty of Boulogne which also concluded the [[The Rough Wooing|war of Rough Wooing]] in Scotland. Simon Renard reported that the English captain accepted his order to surrender from the [[Privy Council]] with a sigh. [[Henry II of France]] formally entered the town on 16 May 1550. He stayed three days and visited the forts of the Boulemberg, [[Ambleteuse]], the Tower of [[Ardres]], the Great Fort and Fort Ch\u00e2tillon (also called Ch\u00e2tillon's garden). He was impressed with some of these recent fortification works and also with the English scheme for bringing freshwater to the town. Henry II determined to continue building the English [[star fort]] at Ambleteuse and the neighbouring work at [[Cap Gris Nez|Blackness]]. The French also admired the mole, which they called 'la Dunette,' and when completed Henry II compared it to a Roman work.<ref>de Rosny, A., ''M\u00e9moires de la societ\u00e9 acad\u00e9mique de Boulogne'' vol. 27, 'Documents in\u00e9dits, concernant les si\u00e8ges de Boulogne, 1548\u20131549' (1912), 533: quoted ''HKW'' (1975), 390.</ref> The [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne]], destroyed or badly damaged by the English, was to be rebuilt, Henry II gave the church a silver statue of Our Lady, and other nobles subscribed money.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 10, (1914) 92\u201393, 24 May 1550.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1544 Siege of Boulogne by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was depicted in the 4th season of the television series ''[[The Tudors]]''.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Portal|Italy|War}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Arnold, Thomas F.
