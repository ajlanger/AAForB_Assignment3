This Convention was a result of three years of meeting and negotiating, after which the text of the Convention was approved by delegates representing close to 140 countries on 19 January 2013 in Geneva and adopted and signed later that year on 10 October 2013 at a Diplomatic Conference held in Kumamoto, Japan. The Convention is named after the Japanese city [[Minamata]]. This naming is of symbolic importance as the city went through a [[Minamata disease|devastating incident]] of mercury poisoning. It is expected that over the next few decades, this international agreement will enhance the reduction of mercury pollution from the targeted activities responsible for the major release of mercury to the immediate environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Marianne|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury|url=http://www2.epa.gov/international-cooperation/minamata-convention-mercury|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe objective of the Minamata Convention is to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It contains, in support of this objective, provisions that relate to the entire life cycle of mercury, including controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted. The treaty also addresses the direct mining of mercury, its export and import, its safe storage and its disposal once as waste. Pinpointing populations at risk, boosting medical care and better training of health-care professionals in identifying and treating mercury-related effects will also result from implementing the Convention.\n\nThe Minamata Convention provides controls over a myriad of products containing mercury, the manufacture, import and export of which will be altogether prohibited by 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/minamata-convention-agreed-nations|title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations|date=19 January 2013|access-date=5 January 2020|publisher=UNEP}}</ref> except where countries have requested an exemption for an initial 5-year period. These products include certain types of batteries, compact fluorescent lamps, relays, soaps and cosmetics, thermometers, and blood pressure devices. Dental fillings which use mercury [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] are also regulated under the Convention, and their use must be phased down through a number of measures.\n\n== Background on mercury ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a naturally occurring element. It can be released to the environment from natural sources \u2013 such as weathering of mercury-containing rocks, forest fires, volcanic eruptions or geothermal activities \u2013 but also from human activities. An estimated 5500-8900 tons of mercury is currently emitted and re-emitted each year to the atmosphere, with much of the re-emitted mercury considered to be related to human activity, as are the direct releases.\n\nDue to its unique properties, mercury has been used in various products and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.<ref>UNEP, 2013.

UNEP Chemicals Branch, Geneva, Switzerland</ref>\n\n== History of the negotiations ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and mercury compounds have long been known to be toxic to human health and the environment. Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as [[Minamata disease]] and [[Niigata Minamata disease]], drew attention to the issue. In 1972, delegates to the [[Stockholm Conference]] on the Human Environment witnessed Japanese junior high school student Shinobu Sakamoto, disabled as the result of methylmercury poisoning ''in utero''. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news\n |last        = Tanaka\n |first       = Hisatoshi\n |title       = Minamata disease sufferer pins hope on mercury ban treaty\n |newspaper   = The Asahi Shimbun\n |location    = Tokyo, Japan\n |publisher   = The Asahi Shimbun Company\n |date        = 9 October 2013\n |url         = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |accessdate  = 10 October 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610220054/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |archivedate = 10 June 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> UN Environment has been actively engaged in bringing the science of mercury poisoning to policy implementation. In 2001, the Executive Director of UN Environment was invited by its Governing Council to undertake a global assessment of mercury and its compounds, including the chemistry and health effects, sources, long-range transport, as well as prevention and control technologies relating to mercury.\n\nIn 2003, the Governing Council considered this assessment and found that there was sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury and its compounds to warrant further international action to reduce the risks to human health and the environment from their release to the environment. Governments were urged to adopt goals for the reduction of mercury emissions and releases and UN Environment initiated technical assistance and capacity-building activities to meet these goals.\n\nA mercury programme to address the concerns posed by mercury was established and further strengthened by governments in 2005 and 2007 with the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership. In 2007, the Governing Council concluded that the options of enhanced voluntary measures and new or existing international legal instruments should be reviewed and assessed in order to make progress in addressing the mercury issue. In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP decided to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Mandate\n | publisher = United Nations Environment Programme\n | url = http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Mercury/Negotiations/Mandates/tabid/3321/Default.aspx\n | accessdate = 10 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nAn intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) was promptly established, through which countries negotiated and developed the text of the convention.

This fifty-ratification milestone was reached on 18 May 2017, hence the Convention entered into force on 16 August 2017. \n\nThe first meeting of [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] to the Minamata Convention on Mercury ([http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Meetings/COP1/tabid/5544/language/en-US/Default.aspx COP1]) took place from 24 to 29 September 2017 at the International Conference Center in Geneva.\n\nThe second meeting of the Conference of the Parties ([http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Meetings/COP2/tabid/6355/language/en-US/Default.aspx COP2]) took place from 19 to 23 November 2018 at the International Conference Center in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe third meeting of the Conference of the Parties ([http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Meetings/COP3/tabid/7854/language/en-US/Default.aspx COP3]) took place from 25 to 29 November 2019 at the International Conference Center in Geneva, Switzerland. At its third meeting, the Conference of the Parties agreed on a number of action items to effectively implement the Minamata Convention.\n\nAfter the Convention entered into force, the Conference of the Parties took place yearly for the first three years.

and 5 Annexes, preceded by a Preamble.\n\nThe preamble of the Convention states that the Parties have recognized that mercury is, \"a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment.\"<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\">{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on mercury|url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/conventionText/Minamata%20Convention%20on%20Mercury_e.pdf|website=Mercury Convention|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> It further refers to previous relevant decisions including of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme as well as to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \"the future we want\". The preamble recalls the lessons of the Minamata disease, in particular the serious safety and environmental effects resulting from mercury pollution and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future.\n\nThe importance of financial, technical, and technological and capacity building support, particularly for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and order to promote the proper implementation of the Convention is stressed. The preamble also recognizes the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury as well as the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, recognizing that the Convention and other international agreements in the field of environment and trade are mutually supportive.<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\" />\n\n=== Article 1 ===\n\n*States the objective of the Convention, which is \"to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds\".\n\n=== Article 2 ===\n* Sets out definitions used in more than one Article of the Convention, including:\n* \"Artisanal and small-scale gold mining\" which refers to gold mining conducted by individual miners or small enterprises with limited capital investment and production;\n* \"Best available techniques\";\n* \"Best environmental practices\" means using the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies;\n* \"Mercury\" specifically refers to elemental mercury (Hg), CAS No. 7439-97-6;\n* \"Mercury compound\";\n* \"Mercury-added product\" refers to a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added;\n* \"Party\" and \"Parties present and voting\";\n* \"Primary mercury mining\";\n* \"Regional economic integration organization\";\n* \"Use allowed\".\n\n===Article 3===\n* Addresses the question of mercury supply sources and trade.\n* The provisions of this Article do not apply to mercury compounds used for laboratory research, naturally occurring trace quantities of mercury or mercury compounds present, mercury-added products.\n* It prohibits parties to allow mercury mining that was not being conducted prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for them, and it only allows mercury mining that was conducted at the date of entry into force for up to fifteen years after that date.\n* It encourages countries to identify individual stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons as well as     sources of mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 metric tons per year. If excess mercury from the decommissioning of chlor alkali facilities is available, such mercury is disposed of in accordance with the guidelines for environmentally sound management using operations that do not lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or     alternative uses.\n* Parties are not allowed to export mercury without the written consent of the importing Party and only for either environmentally sound interim storage or a use allowed. These controls only apply to mercury, not to either mercury compounds or mercury-added products.\n\n===Article 4===\n\n*Addresses the question of Mercury-added products. \n*The Convention employs two approaches to controlling mercury in products, namely setting a phase-out date for some, and specifying measures to be taken in allowing continued use for others.\n\n===Article 5===\n* Deals with manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.\n* Sets out measures either to phase out or to restrict such existing processes.\n* It also does not allow the development of new facilities that would use manufacturing processes listed in Annex B and discourages the development of new manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used.\n\n===Article 6===\n* Relates to exemptions available to a Party upon request.\n* A State or regional economic integration organization can register for one or more exemptions from the phase out dates listed in Parts I of Annexes A and B.\n* They do so on becoming a Party, or in the case of a product or process that is added by amendment to the list, no later than the date upon which that amendment enters into force for it.\n* Exemptions can be registered for a listed category or an identified sub-category.\n* The registration is made by notifying the Secretariat in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the Party's need for the exemption.\n\n===Article 7===\n* Deals with the question of artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore.\n* Each Party that has small-scale gold mining and processing within its territory has the general obligation to take steps to reduce the use of mercury and mercury compounds in such mining and processing needs to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use of mercury and mercury compounds in mining and processing, as well as the emissions and releases to the environment of mercury from such activities.\n* Additional obligations, including the development and implementation of a national action plan, are laid out for a Party that determines that artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in its territory is more than insignificant.\n\n===Article 8===\n* Concerns emissions of mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It aims at controlling and, where feasible, reducing emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to the atmosphere, through measures to control emissions from the point sources listed in Annex D.\n* The Article differentiates between measures required for new sources and those required for existing sources. Releases to land and water are not addressed in Article 8 \u2013 they are addressed in Article 9 of the Convention.\n\n===Article 9===\n* Addresses the releases of mercury and mercury compounds to land and water\n* Aims at controlling and where feasible reducing releases of mercury and mercury compounds from significant anthropogenic point sources that are not addressed in other provisions of the Convention.\n* Each state should within three years after of date of entry into force of the Convention identify the relevant point source categories of releases of mercury into land and water.\n\n===Article 10===\n* Applies to the environmentally sound interim storage of mercury other than waste mercury.\n* Parties are requested to take measures to ensure that mercury and mercury compounds that are intended for a use allowed under the Convention are stored in an environmentally sound manner, taking into account any guidelines and in accordance with any requirements that the Conference of Parties adopts.\n\n===Article 11===\n* Deals with mercury wastes, including their definition, their management in an environmentally sound manner and transportation across international boundaries''.''\n\n===Article 12===\n* Deals with contaminated sites.\n* Each state needs to endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying and assessing sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds.\n* When taking action to reduce the risks posed by sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds, each Party is required to ensure that actions are performed in an environmentally sound manner, and actions incorporate, where appropriate, an assessment of the risks to human health and the environment from mercury or mercury compounds contained in these sites.\n\n===Article 13===\n* Relates to the question of financial resources and mechanism.\n* Establishes a mechanism for the provision of adequate, predictable and timely financial resources, comprising the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund and a specific international programme to support capacity building and technical assistance.\n\n===Article 14===\n* Addresses the issues of capacity-building, technical assistance and technology transfer.\n* Calls for cooperation between Parties to provide timely and appropriate capacity-building and technical assistance to developing country Parties, including through regional, sub regional and national arrangements.\n\n===Article 15===\n* Establishes an Implementation and Compliance Committee to promote implementation of, and compliance with, all provisions of this Convention.\n* The Committee comprises 15 members nominated by Parties and elected by the Conference of the Parties.\n* Issues can be taken up by the Committee on self-referral by a Party, on the basis of information submitted under the reporting provisions, or upon request from the Conference of the Parties.\n\n===Article 16===\n* Relates to health aspects.\n* It encourages Parties to promote the development and implementation of strategies and programmes to identify and protect populations at risk It encourages Parties to adopt and implement

This Convention was a result of three years of meeting and negotiating, after which the text of the Convention was approved by delegates representing close to 140 countries on 19 January 2013 in Geneva and adopted and signed later that year on 10 October 2013 at a Diplomatic Conference held in Kumamoto, Japan. The Convention is named after the Japanese city [[Minamata]]. This naming is of symbolic importance as the city went through a [[Minamata disease|devastating incident]] of mercury poisoning. It is expected that over the next few decades, this international agreement will enhance the reduction of mercury pollution from the targeted activities responsible for the major release of mercury to the immediate environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Marianne|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury|url=http://www2.epa.gov/international-cooperation/minamata-convention-mercury|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe objective of the Minamata Convention is to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It contains, in support of this objective, provisions that relate to the entire life cycle of mercury, including controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted. The treaty also addresses the direct mining of mercury, its export and import, its safe storage and its disposal once as waste. Pinpointing populations at risk, boosting medical care and better training of health-care professionals in identifying and treating mercury-related effects will also result from implementing the Convention.\n\nThe Minamata Convention provides controls over a myriad of products containing mercury, the manufacture, import and export of which will be altogether prohibited by 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/minamata-convention-agreed-nations|title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations|date=19 January 2013|access-date=5 January 2020|publisher=UNEP}}</ref> except where countries have requested an exemption for an initial 5-year period. These products include certain types of batteries, compact fluorescent lamps, relays, soaps and cosmetics, thermometers, and blood pressure devices. Dental fillings which use mercury [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] are also regulated under the Convention, and their use must be phased down through a number of measures.\n\n== Background on mercury ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a naturally occurring element. It can be released to the environment from natural sources \u2013 such as weathering of mercury-containing rocks, forest fires, volcanic eruptions or geothermal activities \u2013 but also from human activities. An estimated 5500-8900 tons of mercury is currently emitted and re-emitted each year to the atmosphere, with much of the re-emitted mercury considered to be related to human activity, as are the direct releases.\n\nDue to its unique properties, mercury has been used in various products and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.<ref>UNEP, 2013. Global Mercury Assessment 2013: Sources, Emissions, Releases\nand Environmental Transport. UNEP Chemicals Branch, Geneva, Switzerland</ref>\n\n== History of the negotiations ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and mercury compounds have long been known to be toxic to human health and the environment. Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as [[Minamata disease]] and [[Niigata Minamata disease]], drew attention to the issue. In 1972, delegates to the [[Stockholm Conference]] on the Human Environment witnessed Japanese junior high school student Shinobu Sakamoto, disabled as the result of methylmercury poisoning ''in utero''. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news\n |last        = Tanaka\n |first       = Hisatoshi\n |title       = Minamata disease sufferer pins hope on mercury ban treaty\n |newspaper   = The Asahi Shimbun\n |location    = Tokyo, Japan\n |publisher   = The Asahi Shimbun Company\n |date        = 9 October 2013\n |url         = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |accessdate  = 10 October 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610220054/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |archivedate = 10 June 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> UN Environment has been actively engaged in bringing the science of mercury poisoning to policy implementation. In 2001, the Executive Director of UN Environment was invited by its Governing Council to undertake a global assessment of mercury and its compounds, including the chemistry and health effects, sources, long-range transport, as well as prevention and control technologies relating to mercury.\n\nIn 2003, the Governing Council considered this assessment and found that there was sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury and its compounds to warrant further international action to reduce the risks to human health and the environment from their release to the environment. Governments were urged to adopt goals for the reduction of mercury emissions and releases and UN Environment initiated technical assistance and capacity-building activities to meet these goals.\n\nA mercury programme to address the concerns posed by mercury was established and further strengthened by governments in 2005 and 2007 with the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership. In 2007, the Governing Council concluded that the options of enhanced voluntary measures and new or existing international legal instruments should be reviewed and assessed in order to make progress in addressing the mercury issue. In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP decided to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Mandate\n | publisher = United Nations Environment Programme\n | url = http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Mercury/Negotiations/Mandates/tabid/3321/Default.aspx\n | accessdate = 10 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nAn intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) was promptly established, through which countries negotiated and developed the text of the convention.

and 5 Annexes, preceded by a Preamble.\n\nThe preamble of the Convention states that the Parties have recognized that mercury is, \"a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment.\"<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\">{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on mercury|url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/conventionText/Minamata%20Convention%20on%20Mercury_e.pdf|website=Mercury Convention|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> It further refers to previous relevant decisions including of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme as well as to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \"the future we want\". The preamble recalls the lessons of the Minamata disease, in particular the serious safety and environmental effects resulting from mercury pollution and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future.\n\nThe importance of financial, technical, and technological and capacity building support, particularly for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and order to promote the proper implementation of the Convention is stressed. The preamble also recognizes the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury as well as the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, recognizing that the Convention and other international agreements in the field of environment and trade are mutually supportive.<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\" />\n\n=== Article 1 ===\n\n*States the objective of the Convention, which is \"to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds\".\n\n=== Article 2 ===\n* Sets out definitions used in more than one Article of the Convention, including:\n* \"Artisanal and small-scale gold mining\" which refers to gold mining conducted by individual miners or small enterprises with limited capital investment and production;\n* \"Best available techniques\";\n* \"Best environmental practices\" means using the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies;\n* \"Mercury\" specifically refers to elemental mercury (Hg), CAS No. 7439-97-6;\n* \"Mercury compound\";\n* \"Mercury-added product\" refers to a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added;\n* \"Party\" and \"Parties present and voting\";\n* \"Primary mercury mining\";\n* \"Regional economic integration organization\";\n* \"Use allowed\".\n\n===Article 3===\n* Addresses the question of mercury supply sources and trade.\n* The provisions of this Article do not apply to mercury compounds used for laboratory research, naturally occurring trace quantities of mercury or mercury compounds present, mercury-added products.\n* It prohibits parties to allow mercury mining that was not being conducted prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for them, and it only allows mercury mining that was conducted at the date of entry into force for up to fifteen years after that date.\n* It encourages countries to identify individual stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons as well as     sources of mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 metric tons per year. If excess mercury from the decommissioning of chlor alkali facilities is available, such mercury is disposed of in accordance with the guidelines for environmentally sound management using operations that do not lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or     alternative uses.\n* Parties are not allowed to export mercury without the written consent of the importing Party and only for either environmentally sound interim storage or a use allowed. These controls only apply to mercury, not to either mercury compounds or mercury-added products.\n\n===Article 4===\n\n*Addresses the question of Mercury-added products. \n*The Convention employs two approaches to controlling mercury in products, namely setting a phase-out date for some, and specifying measures to be taken in allowing continued use for others.\n\n===Article 5===\n* Deals with manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.\n* Sets out measures either to phase out or to restrict such existing processes.\n* It also does not allow the development of new facilities that would use manufacturing processes listed in Annex B and discourages the development of new manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used.\n\n===Article 6===\n* Relates to exemptions available to a Party upon request.\n* A State or regional economic integration organization can register for one or more exemptions from the phase out dates listed in Parts I of Annexes A and B.\n* They do so on becoming a Party, or in the case of a product or process that is added by amendment to the list, no later than the date upon which that amendment enters into force for it.\n* Exemptions can be registered for a listed category or an identified sub-category.\n* The registration is made by notifying the Secretariat in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the Party's need for the exemption.\n\n===Article 7===\n* Deals with the question of artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore.\n* Each Party that has small-scale gold mining and processing within its territory has the general obligation to take steps to reduce the use of mercury and mercury compounds in such mining and processing needs to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use of mercury and mercury compounds in mining and processing, as well as the emissions and releases to the environment of mercury from such activities.\n* Additional obligations, including the development and implementation of a national action plan, are laid out for a Party that determines that artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in its territory is more than insignificant.\n\n===Article 8===\n* Concerns emissions of mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It aims at controlling and, where feasible, reducing emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to the atmosphere, through measures to control emissions from the point sources listed in Annex D.\n* The Article differentiates between measures required for new sources and those required for existing sources. Releases to land and water are not addressed in Article 8 \u2013 they are addressed in Article 9 of the Convention.\n\n===Article 9===\n* Addresses the releases of mercury and mercury compounds to land and water\n* Aims at controlling and where feasible reducing releases of mercury and mercury compounds from significant anthropogenic point sources that are not addressed in other provisions of the Convention.\n* Each state should within three years after of date of entry into force of the Convention identify the relevant point source categories of releases of mercury into land and water.\n\n===Article 10===\n* Applies to the environmentally sound interim storage of mercury other than waste mercury.\n* Parties are requested to take measures to ensure that mercury and mercury compounds that are intended for a use allowed under the Convention are stored in an environmentally sound manner, taking into account any guidelines and in accordance with any requirements that the Conference of Parties adopts.\n\n===Article 11===\n* Deals with mercury wastes, including their definition, their management in an environmentally sound manner and transportation across international boundaries''.''\n\n===Article 12===\n* Deals with contaminated sites.\n* Each state needs to endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying and assessing sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds.\n* When taking action to reduce the risks posed by sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds, each Party is required to ensure that actions are performed in an environmentally sound manner, and actions incorporate, where appropriate, an assessment of the risks to human health and the environment from mercury or mercury compounds contained in these sites.\n\n===Article 13===\n* Relates to the question of financial resources and mechanism.\n* Establishes a mechanism for the provision of adequate, predictable and timely financial resources, comprising the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund and a specific international programme to support capacity building and technical assistance.\n\n===Article 14===\n* Addresses the issues of capacity-building, technical assistance and technology transfer.\n* Calls for cooperation between Parties to provide timely and appropriate capacity-building and technical assistance to developing country Parties, including through regional, sub regional and national arrangements.\n\n===Article 15===\n* Establishes an Implementation and Compliance Committee to promote implementation of, and compliance with, all provisions of this Convention.\n* The Committee comprises 15 members nominated by Parties and elected by the Conference of the Parties.\n* Issues can be taken up by the Committee on self-referral by a Party, on the basis of information submitted under the reporting provisions, or upon request from the Conference of the Parties.\n\n===Article 16===\n* Relates to health aspects.\n* It encourages Parties to promote the development and implementation of strategies and programmes to identify and protect populations at risk It encourages Parties to adopt and implement science based educational and preventive programmes on occupational exposure to mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It encourages Parties to promote appropriate health-care services for prevention,
