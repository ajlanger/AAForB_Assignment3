The [[film]] stars [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Tamannaah|Tamanna]], and [[Gabriela Bertante]] in lead roles, while [[Kota Srinivasa]] and [[Prakash Raj]] play supporting roles. The music was composed by [[Mani Sharma]] with cinematography by [[Shyam K. Naidu]] and editing by S. R. Shekhar. Filming started on 15 June 2012 and it was launched in [[Hyderabad]] on 14 March [[2012]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raagalahari.com/functions/4794/cameraman-gangatho-rambabu-muhurat.aspx|title=Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu Muhurat|publisher=raagalahari.com|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nIt was a down step for Pawan Kalyan as it released after his blockbuster hit ''[[Gabbar Singh (2012 film)|Gabbar Singh]]''. It was the second collaboration between [[Puri Jagannadh]] and [[Pawan Kalyan]] after their previous blockbuster ''[[Badri (2000 film)|Badri]]''. The film was later dubbed into Hindi as ''Mera Target'' by Goldmines Telefilms in [[2015]]. It was also dubbed into Tamil as ''Makkal Veeran.'' The movie was critically acclaimed, and the dialogues in the pre-climax proved to be crucial as the actor was about to announce his political entry.\n\n== Plot ==\nRambabu ([[Pawan Kalyan]]) is a hot-blooded, high-tempered mechanic who has a kind heart, as well as a tendency to react to various social incidents shown or published in the electronic media. After studying his mentality, Ganga ([[Tamannaah]]), a cameraman from NC Channel, offers him a job as a journalist, and he accepts it. Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) tries to collapse the government and regain the CM post. He is strongly supported by his son Rana Babu ([[Prakash Raj]]), a newbie to politics. Meanwhile, reputed journalist Dasaradh Ram ([[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]]) supplies proof about the scams and atrocities committed by Jawahar Naidu, only to be brutally murdered by Rana Babu.\n\nAlthough everyone, including the police, is aware that Rana Babu is the murderer, he is not held accountable. Rambabu valiantly opposes him and gets him arrested. However, Rana Babu is released from jail with the help of his political friends, and he challenges Rambabu that he would be the CM by using the media. A war starts between Rambabu and Rana Babu when Rana Babu enters politics. For gaining political mileage, Rana Babu starts a movement opposing the presence of other states people in Andhra Pradesh and makes it a big movement. He even injures Rambabu severely, but he is saved by Smitha ([[Gabriela Bertante]]), who works for a rival news channel. Rambabu joins Smitha's news channel after getting discharged from the hospital.\n\nRambabu tricks Rana Babu into making some controversial statements on air, thus destroying the momentum of the movement. For making his position in politics strong, he makes Jawahar Naidu deliver his last speech and murders him, which is recorded by Rana Babu's driver, who calls Rambabu and Smitha to show them the video. Smitha shoots Rambabu, steals the video, and makes a deal with Rana Babu to disclose the whole for a hefty price. With the support of all the young blood influenced by his speech, Rambabu reaches the building where Rana Babu hosted a party for his colleagues.\n\nRambabu sends a message to the police commissioner that Rana Babu's guests should vacate the building to avoid themselves being killed along with Rana Babu by the people. Before leaving, Smitha orders to telecast the video, only to be killed by Rana Babu. Rana Babu comes outside with his pistol and shoots Rambabu. The film ends with Rana Babu dying in the stampede of the people and Rambabu reaching the ambulance accompanied by Ganga, whom he loves and who he is being loved by.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Pawan Kalyan]] as Rambabu, a mechanic-turned-journalist\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Ganga, NC Channel cameraman and Rambabu's love interest\n* [[Gabriela Bertante]] as Smitha, rival news channel worker who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu, the opposition leader who gets murdered by Rana babu\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Rana Prathap Naidu, Jawahar Naidu's son who gets murdered by Rambabu\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Bobby\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Chandrasekhara Reddy, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh\n* [[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] as Dasaradh Ram, a journalist who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as SRK\n* [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam]] as MD\n* [[M.

S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] as the CM.\nRS politburo member D. Sharavan said that deleting some scenes from the film would not pacify the people of [[Telangana]] and demanded a total ban on its screening.\n\nThe [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and [[AIADMK]] also sought a ban on the movie, saying it not only showed their leaders in poor light but also ridiculed their chiefs [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]] and [[Karunanidhi]]. TDP activists staged a protest demanding a ban on the movie in [[Kurnool district]] of the [[Rayalaseema]] region.\nPutting an end to the controversy, the makers of Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu have removed the objectionable content from the film with immediate effect.\nFinally, [[Puri Jagannadh]] said no references were made neither about T-movement nor TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu (Bolli dialogue) and he cannot do anything if people come to conclusions with their own interpretation of the scenes.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPawan Kalyan had previously worked with Puri Jagannadh in [[Badri (2000 film)|Badri]], which also was Puri's debut movie.

The [[film]] stars [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Tamannaah|Tamanna]], and [[Gabriela Bertante]] in lead roles, while [[Kota Srinivasa]] and [[Prakash Raj]] play supporting roles. The music was composed by [[Mani Sharma]] with cinematography by [[Shyam K. Naidu]] and editing by S. R. Shekhar. Filming started on 15 June 2012 and was launched in [[Hyderabad]] on 14 March [[2012]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raagalahari.com/functions/4794/cameraman-gangatho-rambabu-muhurat.aspx|title=Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu Muhurat|publisher=raagalahari.com|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nIt was less hyped for Pawan Kalyan as it released after his blockbuster hit ''[[Gabbar Singh (2012 film)|Gabbar Singh]]''. It was the second collaboration between [[Puri Jagannadh]] and [[Pawan Kalyan]] after their previous blockbuster ''[[Badri (2000 film)|Badri]]''. The film was later dubbed into Hindi as ''Mera Target'' by Goldmines Telefilms in [[2015]]. It was also dubbed into Tamil as ''Makkal Veeran.'' It was critically acclaimed, and the dialogues in the pre-climax proved to be crucial as the actor was about to announce his political entry.\n\n== Plot ==\nRambabu ([[Pawan Kalyan]]) is a hot-blooded, high-tempered mechanic who has a kind heart, as well as a tendency to react to various social incidents shown or published in the electronic media. After studying his mentality, Ganga ([[Tamannaah]]), a cameraman from NC Channel, offers him a job as a journalist, and he accepts it. Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) tries to collapse the government and regain the CM post. He is strongly supported by his son Rana Babu ([[Prakash Raj]]), a newbie to politics. Meanwhile, reputed journalist Dasaradh Ram ([[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]]) supplies proof about the scams and atrocities committed by Jawahar Naidu, only to be brutally murdered by Rana Babu.\n\nThough everyone, including the police, is aware that Rana Babu is the murderer, he is not held accountable. Rambabu valiantly opposes him and gets him arrested. However, Rana Babu is released from jail with the help of his political friends, and he challenges Rambabu that he would be the CM by using the media. A war starts between Rambabu and Rana Babu when Rana Babu enters politics. For gaining political mileage, Rana Babu starts a movement opposing the presence of other states people in Andhra Pradesh and makes it a big movement. He even injures Rambabu severely, but he is saved by Smitha ([[Gabriela Bertante]]), who works for a rival news channel. Rambabu joins Smitha's news channel after getting discharged from the hospital.\n\nRambabu tricks Rana Babu into making some controversial statements on air, thus destroying the momentum of the movement. For making his position in politics strong, he makes Jawahar Naidu deliver his last speech and murders him, which is recorded by Rana Babu's driver, who calls Rambabu and Smitha to show them the video. Smitha shoots Rambabu, steals the video, and makes a deal with Rana Babu to disclose the whole for a hefty price. With the support of all the young blood influenced by his speech, Rambabu reaches the building where Rana Babu hosted a party for his colleagues.\n\nRambabu sends a message to the police commissioner that Rana Babu's guests should vacate the building to avoid themselves being killed along with Rana Babu by the people. Before leaving, Smitha orders to telecast the video, only to be killed by Rana Babu. Rana Babu comes outside with his pistol and shoots Rambabu. The film ends with Rana Babu dying in the stampede of the people and Rambabu reaching the ambulance accompanied by Ganga, whom he loves and who he is being loved by.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Pawan Kalyan]] as Rambabu, a mechanic-turned-journalist\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Ganga, NC Channel cameraman and Rambabu's love interest\n* [[Gabriela Bertante]] as Smitha, rival news channel worker who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu, the opposition leader who gets murdered by Rana babu\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Rana Prathap Naidu, Jawahar Naidu's son who gets murdered by Rambabu\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Bobby\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Chandrasekhara Reddy, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh\n* [[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] as Dasaradh Ram, a journalist who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as SRK\n* [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam]] as MD\n* [[M.

S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] as the CM.\nRS politburo member D. Sharavan said that deleting some scenes from the film would not pacify the people of [[Telangana]] and demanded a total ban on its screening.\n\nThe [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and [[AIADMK]] also sought a ban on the movie, saying it not only showed their leaders in poor light but also ridiculed their chiefs [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]] and [[Karunanidhi]]. TDP activists staged a protest demanding a ban on the movie in [[Kurnool district]] of the [[Rayalaseema]] region.\nPutting an end to the controversy, the makers of Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu have removed the objectionable content from the film with immediate effect.\nFinally, [[Puri Jagannadh]] said no references were made neither about T-movement nor TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu (Bolli dialogue) and he cannot do anything if people come to conclusions with their own interpretation of the scenes.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPawan Kalyan had previously worked with Puri Jagannadh in [[Badri (2000 film)|Badri]], which also was Puri's debut movie.
