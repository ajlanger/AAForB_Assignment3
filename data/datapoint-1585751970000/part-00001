Smaller scale painting in manuscripts was probably also practised in this period, though the earliest survivals are from the medieval period.<ref name=\"Blurton, 193\"/> A new style was introduced with [[Mughal painting]], representing a fusion of the [[Persian miniature]] with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its style was diffused across Indian princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style. [[Company painting]]s were made for British clients under the [[British raj]], which from the 19th century also introduced [[art school]]s along Western lines, leading to modern Indian painting, which is increasingly returning to its Indian roots.\n[[File:Swarna Chitrakar - Kolkata 2014-02-14 3080.JPG|thumb|Performance of Patua Sangeet by a [[Patua]], with a [[pattachitra]] scroll to illustrate, [[Kolkata]]]]\n\nIndian paintings can be broadly classified as murals, miniatures and paintings on cloth. Murals are large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the [[Ajanta Caves]] and the Kailashnath temple. [[Miniature art|Miniature painting]]s are executed on a very small scale for books or albums on perishable material such as paper and cloth.  Traces of murals, in [[fresco]]-like techniques, survive in a number of sites with [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], going back at least 2,000 years, but the 1st and 5th-century remains at the [[Ajanta Caves]] are much the most significant.<ref>Harle, 355-361; Wall painting</ref>\n\nPaintings on cloth were often produced in a more popular context, often as [[folk art]], used for example by travelling reciters of epic poetry, such as the [[Bhopa]]s of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Chitrakathi]] elsewhere, and bought as souvenirs of pilgrimages. Very few survivals are older than about 200 years, but it is clear the traditions are much older.  Some regional traditions are still producing works.<ref>Blurton, 201-203, 209-210, 221-222</ref>\n\n==Overview of the main genres==\nIt seems clear that miniature painting, often illustrating manuscripts, has a very long history,<ref>Craven, 219; Harle, 361</ref> but [[Jain]] miniatures from about the 12th century, mostly from West India, and slightly earlier Buddhist ones from the [[Pala Empire]] in the east are the oldest to survive.<ref>Miniature painting; Harle, 361-364</ref>  Similar Hindu illustrations survive from about the 15th century in the west, and 16th century in East India,<ref>Blurton, 200-201, 209-210</ref> by which time the Mughal miniature under [[Akbar]] was also sometimes illustrating translations into Persian of the Hindu epics and other subjects.<ref>Blurton, 193; Harle, 373</ref>\n\nThe great period of Mughal court painting begins with the return of [[Humayun]] from exile in Persia 1555, bringing Persian artists with him.  It ends during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] who rather disapproved of painting for religious reasons, and disbanded the large imperial workshop, by perhaps 1670.  The artists dispersed to smaller princely courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and the \"post-Mughal\" style developed in many local variants.<ref>Harle, 372-382</ref> These included different Rajasthani schools of painting like the Bundi, Kishangarh, Jaipur, Marwar and Mewar. The Ragamala paintings also belong to this school, as does the later [[Company painting]] produced for British clients from the mid-18th century.\n\nModern Indian art has seen the rise of the Bengal School of art in 1930s followed by many forms of experimentations in European and Indian styles. In the aftermath of India's independence, many new genres of art developed by important artists like Jamini Roy, [[M. F. Husain]], [[Francis Newton Souza]], and [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde]]. With the progress of the economy the forms and styles of art also underwent many changes. In the 1990s, Indian economy was liberalised and integrated to the world economy leading to the free flow of cultural information within and without.  Artists include [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Atul Dodiya]], [[Devajyoti Ray]], [[Bose Krishnamachari]] and [[Jitish Kallat]] whose works went for auction in international markets.  Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional [[Madhubani art|Mithila painting]] in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.\n\n== History of Indian painting ==\n====Prehistoric rock art====\nThe pre-historic paintings were generally executed on rocks and these rock engravings were called [[Petroglyph|Petroglyphs]]. These paintings generally depict animal like bison, beer and tigers etc.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Singhania|first=Nitin|title=INDIAN ART AND CULTURE|publisher=Mc Graw Hill Education(India)|year=2018|isbn=93-87067-54-8|location=|pages=pp;page=2.3}}</ref>The oldest Indian paintings are rock art in caves which are around 10,000 years old, such as the [[Bhimbetka cave paintings]].<ref name=\"Ghosh-1990\">{{cite book |last=Ghosh |first=Amalananda |title=An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&pg=PA284 |accessdate=25 August 2019 |date=December 1990 |publisher=E.J.

There are known more than 20 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Sittanavasal]], [[Armamalai Cave]] (Tamil Nadu), [[Ravan Chhaya rock shelter]], Kailasanatha temple in [[Ellora Caves]].\n\nMurals from this period depict mainly religious themes of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu religions. There are though also locations where paintings were made to adorn mundane premises, like the ancient theatre room in Jogimara Cave and possible royal hunting lodge circa 7th-century AD \u2013 Ravan Chhaya rock shelter.\n\nThe pattern of large scale wall painting which had dominated the scene, witnessed the advent of miniature paintings during the 11th and 12th centuries. This new style figured first in the form of illustrations etched on palm-leaf manuscripts. The contents of these manuscripts included literature on Buddhism and Jainism. In eastern India, the principal centres of artistic and intellectual activities of the Buddhist religion were Nalanda, Odantapuri, Vikramshila and Somarpura situated in the Pala kingdom (Bengal and Bihar).\n\n=== Miniatures before the Mughals ===\nEarly survivals of portable Indian paintings are all miniatures from texts (the great majority) or painted objects such as boxes.  Despite considerable evidence that larger paintings on cloth (known as ''pata'') existed, and indeed surviving texts discussing how to make them, not a single medieval Indian painting on cloth is known to survive, unless some Buddhist ones have been taken as Tibetan,<ref>Steven Kossak, Jane Casey Singer, Robert Bruce-Gardner, ''Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet'', p. 12, 1998, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Museum Rietberg, {{ISBN|0870998625}}, 9780870998621, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lTN6hDziKC0C&printsec=frontcover google books (full view)]</ref> or from Central Asia.  Some of the images recovered by Sir [[Aurel Stein]] show Hindu deities (most are Buddhist).<ref name=\"Blurton, 193\"/>\n\n====Eastern India====\nIn eastern India miniature painting survives from the 10th century. These miniatures, depicting Buddhist divinities and scenes from the life of Buddha were painted on the leaves (about 2.25 by 3&nbsp;inches) of the palm-leaf manuscripts as well as their wooden covers. Most common Buddhist illustrated manuscripts include the texts ''[[Perfection of Wisdom|Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]'',<ref>Coomaraswamy, Ananda K. (1999). ''Introduction to Indian Art'',: Munshiram Manoharlal, {{ISBN|81-215-0389-2}} p.68-70</ref> ''Pancharaksa'', ''Karandavyuha'' and ''Kalachakra Tantra''. The earliest extant miniatures are found in a manuscript of the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita'' dated in the sixth regnal year of [[Mahipala]] (c. 993), presently the possession of [[The Asiatic Society]], Kolkata. This style disappeared from India in the late 12th century.\n\nThe influence of eastern Indian paintings can be seen in various Buddhist temples in [[Bagan]], [[Myanmar]] particularly [[Abeyadana temple]] which was named after Queen consort of Myanmar, [[Apeyadana|Abeyadana]] who herself had Indian roots and [[Gubyaukgyi Temple (Myinkaba)|Gubyaukgyi Temple]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The significance of North East India in the development of the sculpture of Bagan|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/saaap/news/file124891.pdf|journal=University of London|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The influences of eastern Indian paintings can also be clearly observed in [[Thangka|Tibetan Thangka]] paintings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lTN6hDziKC0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=tibet+painting#v=onepage&q=india&f=false|title=Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet|last=Kossak|first=Steven|last2=Singer|first2=Jane Casey|last3=Bruce-Gardner|first3=Robert|last4=N.Y.)|first4=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|date=1998|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870998621|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Western India ====\n{{Further|Jain art}}\nSurviving illustrated manuscripts from Western India, mainly [[Gujarat]], begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the 13th onwards. Initially surviving examples are all [[Jain art|Jain]]. By the 15th-century they were becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold.<ref>Rowland, 341-343}}</ref>\n\nThe manuscript text most frequently illustrated is the ''[[Kalpa S\u016btra]]'', containing the biographies of the [[Tirthankara]]s, notably [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]].  The illustrations are square-ish panels set in the text, with \"wiry drawing\" and \"brilliant, even jewel-like colour\".  The figures are always seen in three-quarters view, with distinctive \"long pointed noses and protruding eyes\".  There is a convention whereby the more distant side of the face protrudes, so that both eyes are seen.<ref>Rowland, 343}}</ref>\n\n===Shadanga of Indian painting===\nAncient texts defined six important aspects of painting.  These 'Six Limbs' have been translated as follows:<ref name=\"Coomaraswamy2003\">{{cite book|last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda K.|title=History of Indian and Indonesian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JPmp2aAQdcC&pg=PA88|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-5801-6|page=88}}</ref>\n\n# ''Rupabheda'' The knowledge of appearances.\n# ''Pramanam'' Correct perception, measure and structure.\n# ''Bhava'' Action of feelings on forms.\n# ''Lavanya Yojanam'' Infusion of grace, artistic representation.\n# ''Sadrisyam'' Similitude.\n# ''Varnikabhanga'' Artistic manner of using the brush and colours. (Tagore.)\n\nThe subsequent development of painting by the Buddhists indicates that these ' Six Limbs ' were put into practice by Indian artists, and are the basic principles on which their art was founded.\n\n=== Early Modern period (1526\u20151857 CE) ===\n\n====Mughal painting====\n{{main|Mughal painting}}\n[[File:Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign.jpg|thumb|''[[Jahangir]] Receives Prince [[Khurram]] at [[Ajmer]] on His Return from the [[Mewar]] Campaign'', [[Balchand]], c. 1635]]\n[[Mughal painting]] is a style of Indian painting, generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/XQIC2ZXP7c1MLg|title=Indian Miniature Paintings: The Mughal and Persian Schools - Google Arts & Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}</ref> The Mughal style was heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature]]s, and in turn influenced several Indian styles, including the [[Rajput painting|Rajput]], [[Pahari painting|Pahari]] and [[Deccan painting|Deccan]] styles of painting.\n\nMughal paintings were a unique blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles. Because the Mughal kings wanted visual records of their deeds as hunters and conquerors, their artists accompanied them on military expeditions or missions of state, or recorded their prowess as animal slayers, or depicted them in the great dynastic ceremonies of marriages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh/hd_mugh.htm|title=The Art of the Mughals before 1600|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064305/https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh/hd_mugh.htm|archive-date=2018-02-03|url-status=live|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Meister der Hamza-N\u00e2ma-Handschrift 001.jpg|thumb|left|A folio from the [[Hamzanama]]]]Akbar's reign (1556\u20131605) ushered a new era in Indian miniature painting.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/South-Asian-arts|title=South Asian arts - Visual arts of India and Sri Lanka (Ceylon)|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref> After he had consolidated his political power, he built a new capital at Fatehpur Sikri where he collected artists from India and Persia. He was the first monarch who established in India an atelier under the supervision of two Persian master artists, Mir Sayyed Ali and [[Khwaja Abdus Samad|Abdus Samad]]. Earlier, both of them had served under the patronage of Humayun in Kabul and accompanied him to India when he regained his throne in 1555. More than a hundred painters were employed, most of whom were from Gujarat, Gwalior and Kashmir, who gave a birth to a new school of painting, popularly known as the Mughal School of miniature Paintings.\n\nOne of the first productions of that school of miniature painting was the [[Hamzanama]] series, which according to the court historian, Badayuni, was started in 1567 and completed in 1582. The [[Hamzanama]], stories of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet, were illustrated by [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]. The paintings of the Hamzanama are of large size, 20 x 27\" and were painted on cloth. They are in the Persian safavi style. Brilliant red, blue and green colours predominate; the pink, eroded rocks and the vegetation, planes and blossoming plum and peach trees are reminiscent of Persia. However, Indian tones appear in later work, when Indian artists were employed.\n\nAfter him, [[Jahangir]] encouraged artists to paint portraits and durbar scenes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh_2/hd_mugh_2.htm|title=The Art of the Mughals after 1600|last=Sardar|first=Marika|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219205406/https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh_2/hd_mugh_2.htm|archive-date=2017-12-19|url-status=live|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" /> His most talented portrait painters were [[Ustad Mansur]], Abul Hasan and [[Bishandas]].\n\n[[Shah Jahan]] (1627\u20131658) continued the patronage of painting.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some of the famous artists of the period were Mohammad Faqirullah Khan, Mir Hashim, Muhammad Nadir, [[Bichitr]], Chitarman, Anupchhatar, Manohar and Honhar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/IAKyl2TieuDGKg|title=Treasures of National Museum, India|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[Aurangzeb]] had no taste for fine arts, probably due to his Islamic conservatism.<ref name=\":1\" /> Due to lack of patronage artists migrated to the Deccan and the Hindu courts of [[Rajputana]], greatly influencing the styles in these centres.\n\n====Deccan painting====\n{{main|Deccan painting|}}\n[[File:Al-Buraq.jpg|thumb|Composite [[Buraq]], [[National Museum, New Delhi]], [[Hyderabad]], 1770\u201375.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/UgJSsSkMl8_LJw|title=Nauras: The Many Arts of the Deccan|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>|alt=]]\nDeccan painting was produced in the [[Deccan]] region of [[Central India]], in the various Muslim capitals of the [[Deccan sultanates]] that emerged from the break-up of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] by 1520.

Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Many miniatures were individual album pieces, but there are also illustrated books, and there was at the same time some mural painting on the walls of palaces, forts, and [[haveli]]s.

These paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Mysore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of cartridge paper pasted on a wooden base. A paste made of [[zinc oxide]] and [[arabic gum]] is made called \"gesso paste\". With the help of a thin brush all the jewellery and parts of throne or the arch which have some relief are painted over to give a slightly raised effect of carving. This is allowed to dry. On this thin gold foil is pasted. The rest of the drawing is then painted using watercolours. Only muted colours are used.\n\n====Tanjore painting====\n{{main|Tanjore painting}}\n[[File:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|thumb|right|Tanjore style painting depicting the ten [[Sikh Gurus]] with [[Bhai Bala]] and [[Bhai Mardana]].]]\nTanjore painting is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and apply it on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewelry and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewelry. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted.

Apart from the fragmentary evidence of paintings on the caves of [[Khandagiri]] and [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]] and Sitabhinji murals of the Sixth century A.D., the earliest indigenous paintings from Odisha are the Pattachitra done by the Chitrakars (the painters are called Chitrakars).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pattachitra.com/pattachitra.htm|title=HugeDomains.com - Pattachitra.com is for sale (Pattachitra)|publisher=}}</ref> The theme of Oriya painting centres round the [[Vaishnava]] sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture Lord Jagannath who was an incarnation of Lord Krishna was the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and folk lore. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]], different \"Vesas\" of [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]], temple activities, the ten [[incarnation]]s of [[Vishnu]] basing on the '[[Gita Govinda]]' of [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]], Kama Kujara Naba Gunjara, [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]]. The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours. White colour is made from the [[conch]]-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the [[hue]]. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure [[lamp-black]] or black prepared from the burning of cocoanut shells are used.The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes. That old tradition of Oriya painting still survives to-day in the skilled hands of Chitrakaras (traditional painters) in [[Puri]], [[Raghurajpur]], [[Paralakhemundi]], Chikiti and [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]].\n\n==== Other regional styles ====\n{{Main|Madhubani Painting|}}\n[[Madhubani/Mithila Painting|Madhubani painting]] is a style of painting, practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar state.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nidceedhelp.in/indian-traditional-state-paintings/|title=Indian State Traditional Paintings - NID CEED Help|date=2017-08-13|work=NID CEED Help|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Themes revolve around Hindu Gods and mythology, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings.

The courts of the [[princely state]]s of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts.

Siva Kumar, \u201cselective Westernization for self-improvement gave way to a nationalist cultural counter-stance around the turn of the century -- universally, the first step toward a political resistance toward colonial rule.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R.

It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.\n\nThe Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma|Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet and artist [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \"materialism\" of the West. His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations.\n\nTagore later attempted to develop links with Far-Eastern artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art.  Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, [[B.C. Sanyal]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], and subsequently their students [[A. Ramachandran]], Tan Yuan Chameli, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and a few others.\n\nThe Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.[[K. G. Subramanyan]]'s role in this movement is significant.\n\n====Contextual Modernism====\n{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}\nThe term [[Contextual Modernism]] that Siva Kumar used in the catalogue of the exhibition has emerged as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of the art the Santiniketan artists had practised.\n\nSeveral terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]'s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that \u2018Contextual Modernism\u2019 is a more suited term because \u201cthe colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonised situations to internalise inferiority. Santiniketan\u2019s artist teachers\u2019 refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterised imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.\u201d<ref>http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to [[R. Siva Kumar]] \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\"<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\">{{cite web|url=http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/|title=humanities underground \u00bb All The Shared Experiences Of The Lived World II|publisher=}}</ref> He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\"/>\n\nThe literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, \"The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya\u2019s eyes to the historical circumstances of what the art historian [[R Siva Kumar]] has called a \u201ccontextual modernism\u201d developed in eastern India in the 1930s and \u201940s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/|title=Creator of a Floating World - Ranjit Hoskote - Tehelka - Investigations, Latest News, Politics, Analysis, Blogs, Culture, Photos, Videos, Podcasts|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711|title=\"Contextual modernism\" \u2013 is it possible?

Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/emit/hd_emit.htm|title=Early Modernists and Indian Traditions|last=Ali|first=Atteqa|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila Painting in most contemporary way and uses both realism as well abstractionism in her work with a lot of fantasy mixed in to both .Her work has an impeccable sense of balance, harmony and grace.\n\nBy the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.\n\nThe [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists \u2013 [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mind/hd_mind.htm|title=Modern Art in India|last=Ali|first=Atteqa|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625230225/http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/mind/hd_mind.htm|archive-date=2017-06-25|url-status=live|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group.

Gaitonde]], [[Krishen Khanna]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]] and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], [[Prokash Karmakar]], [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icon of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos.\n\nAlso, the increase in the discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, appropriated the way art was perceived in the art schools.

The critics also had an important role as curators of important exhibitions, re-defining modernism and Indian-art.\n\nIndian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post-liberalization Indian art thus works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it.  In this phase, artists have introduced even newer concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil.  Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into a fantastic images.\n\n==Vernacular Indian Painting==\n[[File:Ladoo-Bai-aux-museum-of-Tribal-Art-Bhopal.jpg|210px|Ladoo Bai (Bhil artiste) |alt=|thumb]]\nVernacular art is an art alive (contemporary art), based on the past (the myths, the traditions and the religion) and made by defined groups.

Smaller scale painting in manuscripts was probably also practised in this period, though the earliest survivals are from the medieval period.<ref name=\"Blurton, 193\"/> A new style was introduced with [[Mughal painting]], representing a fusion of the [[Persian miniature]] with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its style was diffused across Indian princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style. [[Company painting]]s were made for British clients under the [[British raj]], which from the 19th century also introduced [[art school]]s along Western lines, leading to modern Indian painting, which is increasingly returning to its Indian roots.\n[[File:Swarna Chitrakar - Kolkata 2014-02-14 3080.JPG|thumb|Performance of Patua Sangeet by a [[Patua]], with a [[pattachitra]] scroll to illustrate, [[Kolkata]]]]\n\nIndian paintings can be broadly classified as murals, miniatures and paintings on cloth. Murals are large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the [[Ajanta Caves]] and the Kailashnath temple. [[Miniature art|Miniature painting]]s are executed on a very small scale for books or albums on perishable material such as paper and cloth.  Traces of murals, in [[fresco]]-like techniques, survive in a number of sites with [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], going back at least 2,000 years, but the 1st and 5th-century remains at the [[Ajanta Caves]] are much the most significant.<ref>Harle, 355-361; Wall painting</ref>\n\nPaintings on cloth were often produced in a more popular context, often as [[folk art]], used for example by travelling reciters of epic poetry, such as the [[Bhopa]]s of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Chitrakathi]] elsewhere, and bought as souvenirs of pilgrimages. Very few survivals are older than about 200 years, but it is clear the traditions are much older.  Some regional traditions are still producing works.<ref>Blurton, 201-203, 209-210, 221-222</ref>\n\n==Overview of the main genres==\nIt seems clear that miniature painting, often illustrating manuscripts, has a very long history,<ref>Craven, 219; Harle, 361</ref> but [[Jain]] miniatures from about the 12th century, mostly from West India, and slightly earlier Buddhist ones from the [[Pala Empire]] in the east are the oldest to survive.<ref>Miniature painting; Harle, 361-364</ref>  Similar Hindu illustrations survive from about the 15th century in the west, and 16th century in East India,<ref>Blurton, 200-201, 209-210</ref> by which time the Mughal miniature under [[Akbar]] was also sometimes illustrating translations into Persian of the Hindu epics and other subjects.<ref>Blurton, 193; Harle, 373</ref>\n\nThe great period of Mughal court painting begins with the return of [[Humayun]] from exile in Persia 1555, bringing Persian artists with him.  It ends during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] who rather disapproved of painting for religious reasons, and disbanded the large imperial workshop, by perhaps 1670.  The artists dispersed to smaller princely courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and the \"post-Mughal\" style developed in many local variants.<ref>Harle, 372-382</ref> These included different Rajasthani schools of painting like the Bundi, Kishangarh, Jaipur, Marwar and Mewar. The Ragamala paintings also belong to this school, as does the later [[Company painting]] produced for British clients from the mid-18th century.\n\nModern Indian art has seen the rise of the Bengal School of art in 1930s followed by many forms of experimentations in European and Indian styles. In the aftermath of India's independence, many new genres of art developed by important artists like Jamini Roy, [[M. F. Husain]], [[Francis Newton Souza]], and [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde]]. With the progress of the economy the forms and styles of art also underwent many changes. In the 1990s, Indian economy was liberalised and integrated to the world economy leading to the free flow of cultural information within and without.  Artists include [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Atul Dodiya]], [[Devajyoti Ray]], [[Bose Krishnamachari]] and [[Jitish Kallat]] whose works went for auction in international markets.  Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional [[Madhubani art|Mithila painting]] in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.\n\n== History of Indian painting ==\n====Prehistoric rock art====\nThe pre-historic paintings were generally executed on rocks and these rock engravings were called [[Petroglyph|Petroglyphs]]. These paintings generally depict animal like bison, beer and tigers etc.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Singhania|first=Nitin|title=INDIAN ART AND CULTURE|publisher=Mc Graw Hill Education(India)|year=2018|isbn=93-87067-54-8|location=|pages=pp;page=2.3}}</ref>The oldest Indian paintings are rock art in caves which are around 10,000 years old, such as the [[Bhimbetka cave paintings]].<ref name=\"Ghosh-1990\">{{cite book |last=Ghosh |first=Amalananda |title=An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&pg=PA284 |accessdate=25 August 2019 |date=December 1990 |publisher=E.J.

There are known more than 20 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Sittanavasal]], [[Armamalai Cave]] (Tamil Nadu), [[Ravan Chhaya rock shelter]], Kailasanatha temple in [[Ellora Caves]].\n\nMurals from this period depict mainly religious themes of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu religions. There are though also locations where paintings were made to adorn mundane premises, like the ancient theatre room in Jogimara Cave and possible royal hunting lodge circa 7th-century AD \u2013 Ravan Chhaya rock shelter.\n\nThe pattern of large scale wall painting which had dominated the scene, witnessed the advent of miniature paintings during the 11th and 12th centuries. This new style figured first in the form of illustrations etched on palm-leaf manuscripts. The contents of these manuscripts included literature on Buddhism and Jainism. In eastern India, the principal centres of artistic and intellectual activities of the Buddhist religion were Nalanda, Odantapuri, Vikramshila and Somarpura situated in the Pala kingdom (Bengal and Bihar).\n\n=== Miniatures before the Mughals ===\nEarly survivals of portable Indian paintings are all miniatures from texts (the great majority) or painted objects such as boxes.  Despite considerable evidence that larger paintings on cloth (known as ''pata'') existed, and indeed surviving texts discussing how to make them, not a single medieval Indian painting on cloth is known to survive, unless some Buddhist ones have been taken as Tibetan,<ref>Steven Kossak, Jane Casey Singer, Robert Bruce-Gardner, ''Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet'', p. 12, 1998, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Museum Rietberg, {{ISBN|0870998625}}, 9780870998621, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lTN6hDziKC0C&printsec=frontcover google books (full view)]</ref> or from Central Asia.  Some of the images recovered by Sir [[Aurel Stein]] show Hindu deities (most are Buddhist).<ref name=\"Blurton, 193\"/>\n\n====Eastern India====\nIn eastern India miniature painting survives from the 10th century. These miniatures, depicting Buddhist divinities and scenes from the life of Buddha were painted on the leaves (about 2.25 by 3&nbsp;inches) of the palm-leaf manuscripts as well as their wooden covers. Most common Buddhist illustrated manuscripts include the texts ''[[Perfection of Wisdom|Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]'',<ref>Coomaraswamy, Ananda K. (1999). ''Introduction to Indian Art'',: Munshiram Manoharlal, {{ISBN|81-215-0389-2}} p.68-70</ref> ''Pancharaksa'', ''Karandavyuha'' and ''Kalachakra Tantra''. The earliest extant miniatures are found in a manuscript of the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita'' dated in the sixth regnal year of [[Mahipala]] (c. 993), presently the possession of [[The Asiatic Society]], Kolkata. This style disappeared from India in the late 12th century.\n\nThe influence of eastern Indian paintings can be seen in various Buddhist temples in [[Bagan]], [[Myanmar]] particularly [[Abeyadana temple]] which was named after Queen consort of Myanmar, [[Apeyadana|Abeyadana]] who herself had Indian roots and [[Gubyaukgyi Temple (Myinkaba)|Gubyaukgyi Temple]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The significance of North East India in the development of the sculpture of Bagan|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/saaap/news/file124891.pdf|journal=University of London|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The influences of eastern Indian paintings can also be clearly observed in [[Thangka|Tibetan Thangka]] paintings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lTN6hDziKC0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=tibet+painting#v=onepage&q=india&f=false|title=Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet|last=Kossak|first=Steven|last2=Singer|first2=Jane Casey|last3=Bruce-Gardner|first3=Robert|last4=N.Y.)|first4=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|date=1998|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870998621|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Western India ====\n{{Further|Jain art}}\nSurviving illustrated manuscripts from Western India, mainly [[Gujarat]], begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the 13th onwards. Initially surviving examples are all [[Jain art|Jain]]. By the 15th-century they were becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold.<ref>Rowland, 341-343}}</ref>\n\nThe manuscript text most frequently illustrated is the ''[[Kalpa S\u016btra]]'', containing the biographies of the [[Tirthankara]]s, notably [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]].  The illustrations are square-ish panels set in the text, with \"wiry drawing\" and \"brilliant, even jewel-like colour\".  The figures are always seen in three-quarters view, with distinctive \"long pointed noses and protruding eyes\".  There is a convention whereby the more distant side of the face protrudes, so that both eyes are seen.<ref>Rowland, 343}}</ref>\n\n===Shadanga of Indian painting===\nAncient texts defined six important aspects of painting.  These 'Six Limbs' have been translated as follows:<ref name=\"Coomaraswamy2003\">{{cite book|last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda K.|title=History of Indian and Indonesian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JPmp2aAQdcC&pg=PA88|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-5801-6|page=88}}</ref>\n\n# ''Rupabheda'' The knowledge of appearances.\n# ''Pramanam'' Correct perception, measure and structure.\n# ''Bhava'' Action of feelings on forms.\n# ''Lavanya Yojanam'' Infusion of grace, artistic representation.\n# ''Sadrisyam'' Similitude.\n# ''Varnikabhanga'' Artistic manner of using the brush and colours. (Tagore.)\n\nThe subsequent development of painting by the Buddhists indicates that these ' Six Limbs ' were put into practice by Indian artists, and are the basic principles on which their art was founded.\n\n=== Early Modern period (1526\u20151857 CE) ===\n\n====Mughal painting====\n{{main|Mughal painting}}\n[[File:Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign.jpg|thumb|''[[Jahangir]] Receives Prince [[Khurram]] at [[Ajmer]] on His Return from the [[Mewar]] Campaign'', [[Balchand]], c. 1635]]\n[[Mughal painting]] is a style of Indian painting, generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/XQIC2ZXP7c1MLg|title=Indian Miniature Paintings: The Mughal and Persian Schools - Google Arts & Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}</ref> The Mughal style was heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature]]s, and in turn influenced several Indian styles, including the [[Rajput painting|Rajput]], [[Pahari painting|Pahari]] and [[Deccan painting|Deccan]] styles of painting.\n\nMughal paintings were a unique blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles. Because the Mughal kings wanted visual records of their deeds as hunters and conquerors, their artists accompanied them on military expeditions or missions of state, or recorded their prowess as animal slayers, or depicted them in the great dynastic ceremonies of marriages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh/hd_mugh.htm|title=The Art of the Mughals before 1600|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064305/https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh/hd_mugh.htm|archive-date=2018-02-03|url-status=live|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Meister der Hamza-N\u00e2ma-Handschrift 001.jpg|thumb|left|A folio from the [[Hamzanama]]]]Akbar's reign (1556\u20131605) ushered a new era in Indian miniature painting.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/South-Asian-arts|title=South Asian arts - Visual arts of India and Sri Lanka (Ceylon)|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref> After he had consolidated his political power, he built a new capital at Fatehpur Sikri where he collected artists from India and Persia. He was the first monarch who established in India an atelier under the supervision of two Persian master artists, Mir Sayyed Ali and [[Khwaja Abdus Samad|Abdus Samad]]. Earlier, both of them had served under the patronage of Humayun in Kabul and accompanied him to India when he regained his throne in 1555. More than a hundred painters were employed, most of whom were from Gujarat, Gwalior and Kashmir, who gave a birth to a new school of painting, popularly known as the Mughal School of miniature Paintings.\n\nOne of the first productions of that school of miniature painting was the [[Hamzanama]] series, which according to the court historian, Badayuni, was started in 1567 and completed in 1582. The [[Hamzanama]], stories of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet, were illustrated by [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]. The paintings of the Hamzanama are of large size, 20 x 27\" and were painted on cloth. They are in the Persian safavi style. Brilliant red, blue and green colours predominate; the pink, eroded rocks and the vegetation, planes and blossoming plum and peach trees are reminiscent of Persia. However, Indian tones appear in later work, when Indian artists were employed.\n\nAfter him, [[Jahangir]] encouraged artists to paint portraits and durbar scenes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh_2/hd_mugh_2.htm|title=The Art of the Mughals after 1600|last=Sardar|first=Marika|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219205406/https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh_2/hd_mugh_2.htm|archive-date=2017-12-19|url-status=live|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" /> His most talented portrait painters were [[Ustad Mansur]], Abul Hasan and [[Bishandas]].\n\n[[Shah Jahan]] (1627\u20131658) continued the patronage of painting.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some of the famous artists of the period were Mohammad Faqirullah Khan, Mir Hashim, Muhammad Nadir, [[Bichitr]], Chitarman, Anupchhatar, Manohar and Honhar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/IAKyl2TieuDGKg|title=Treasures of National Museum, India|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[Aurangzeb]] had no taste for fine arts, probably due to his Islamic conservatism.<ref name=\":1\" /> Due to lack of patronage artists migrated to the Deccan and the Hindu courts of [[Rajputana]], greatly influencing the styles in these centres.\n\n====Deccan painting====\n{{main|Deccan painting|}}\n[[File:Al-Buraq.jpg|thumb|Composite [[Buraq]], [[National Museum, New Delhi]], [[Hyderabad]], 1770\u201375.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/UgJSsSkMl8_LJw|title=Nauras: The Many Arts of the Deccan|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>|alt=]]\nDeccan painting was produced in the [[Deccan]] region of [[Central India]], in the various Muslim capitals of the [[Deccan sultanates]] that emerged from the break-up of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] by 1520.

These paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Mysore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of cartridge paper pasted on a wooden base. A paste made of [[zinc oxide]] and [[arabic gum]] is made called \"gesso paste\". With the help of a thin brush all the jewellery and parts of throne or the arch which have some relief are painted over to give a slightly raised effect of carving. This is allowed to dry. On this thin gold foil is pasted. The rest of the drawing is then painted using watercolours. Only muted colours are used.\n\n====Tanjore painting====\n{{main|Tanjore painting}}\n[[File:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|thumb|right|Tanjore style painting depicting the ten [[Sikh Gurus]] with [[Bhai Bala]] and [[Bhai Mardana]].]]\nTanjore painting is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and apply it on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used.

Apart from the fragmentary evidence of paintings on the caves of [[Khandagiri]] and [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]] and Sitabhinji murals of the Sixth century A.D., the earliest indigenous paintings from Odisha are the Pattachitra done by the Chitrakars (the painters are called Chitrakars).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pattachitra.com/pattachitra.htm|title=HugeDomains.com - Pattachitra.com is for sale (Pattachitra)|publisher=}}</ref> The theme of Oriya painting centres round the [[Vaishnava]] sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture Lord Jagannath who was an incarnation of Lord Krishna was the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and folk lore. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]], different \"Vesas\" of [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]], temple activities, the ten [[incarnation]]s of [[Vishnu]] basing on the '[[Gita Govinda]]' of [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]], Kama Kujara Naba Gunjara, [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]]. The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours. White colour is made from the [[conch]]-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the [[hue]]. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure [[lamp-black]] or black prepared from the burning of cocoanut shells are used.The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes. That old tradition of Oriya painting still survives to-day in the skilled hands of Chitrakaras (traditional painters) in [[Puri]], [[Raghurajpur]], [[Paralakhemundi]], Chikiti and [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]].\n\n==== Other regional styles ====\n{{Main|Madhubani Painting|}}\n[[Madhubani/Mithila Painting|Madhubani painting]] is a style of painting, practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar state.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nidceedhelp.in/indian-traditional-state-paintings/|title=Indian State Traditional Paintings - NID CEED Help|date=2017-08-13|work=NID CEED Help|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Themes revolve around Hindu Gods and mythology, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings.

The courts of the [[princely state]]s of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts.

Siva Kumar, \u201cselective Westernization for self-improvement gave way to a nationalist cultural counter-stance around the turn of the century -- universally, the first step toward a political resistance toward colonial rule.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Siva Kumar (1999) Modern Indian Art: A Brief Overview, Art Journal, 58:3, 15</ref> In practice, this materialized as an assimilation of \u201cdiverse Asian elements,\u201d expanding tradition more than reviving it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Leading artist of the time, [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), utilized both the Western-influenced realism and Asian elements which brought him \u201cclose to early modernism.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in historic and more nationalistic Indian art, called as the [[Bengal school of art]], which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India.\n\n====Bengal school====\n[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|thumb|''[[Bharat Mata (painting)|Bharat Mata]]'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871\u20131951), a [[Bharat Mata|personification of India]].]]\n{{main|Bengal school of art}}\n[[File:The_Passing_of_Shah_Jahan.jpg|thumb|''[[The Passing of Shah Jahan]]'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]].]]\nThe [[Bengal School of Art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in India during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.\n\nThe Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma|Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet and artist [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \"materialism\" of the West. His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations.\n\nTagore later attempted to develop links with Far-Eastern artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art.  Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, [[B.C. Sanyal]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], and subsequently their students [[A. Ramachandran]], Tan Yuan Chameli, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and a few others.\n\nThe Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.[[K. G. Subramanyan]]'s role in this movement is significant.\n\n====Contextual Modernism====\n{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}\nThe term [[Contextual Modernism]] that Siva Kumar used in the catalogue of the exhibition has emerged as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of the art the Santiniketan artists had practised.\n\nSeveral terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]'s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that \u2018Contextual Modernism\u2019 is a more suited term because \u201cthe colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonised situations to internalise inferiority. Santiniketan\u2019s artist teachers\u2019 refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterised imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.\u201d<ref>http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to [[R. Siva Kumar]] \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\"<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\">{{cite web|url=http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/|title=humanities underground \u00bb All The Shared Experiences Of The Lived World II|publisher=}}</ref> He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\"/>\n\nThe literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, \"The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya\u2019s eyes to the historical circumstances of what the art historian [[R Siva Kumar]] has called a \u201ccontextual modernism\u201d developed in eastern India in the 1930s and \u201940s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/|title=Creator of a Floating World - Ranjit Hoskote - Tehelka - Investigations, Latest News, Politics, Analysis, Blogs, Culture, Photos, Videos, Podcasts|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711|title=\"Contextual modernism\" \u2013 is it possible?

Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/emit/hd_emit.htm|title=Early Modernists and Indian Traditions|last=Ali|first=Atteqa|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila Painting in most contemporary way and uses both realism as well abstractionism in her work with a lot of fantasy mixed in to both .Her work has an impeccable sense of balance, harmony and grace.\n\nBy the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.\n\nThe [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists \u2013 [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mind/hd_mind.htm|title=Modern Art in India|last=Ali|first=Atteqa|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625230225/http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/mind/hd_mind.htm|archive-date=2017-06-25|url-status=live|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are [[Bal Chabda]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Krishen Khanna]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]] and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], [[Prokash Karmakar]], [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icon of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos.\n\nAlso, the increase in the discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, appropriated the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous, critics like [[Geeta Kapur]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khojworkshop.org/user/geeta_kapur |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924023312/http://khojworkshop.org/user/geeta_kapur |archivedate=24 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterall.org/online/geeta-kapur-part1|title=Afterall \u2022 Online \u2022 Geeta Kapur: On the Curatorial in India (Part 1)|publisher=}}</ref> [[R .

The critics also had an important role as curators of important exhibitions, re-defining modernism and Indian-art.\n\nIndian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post-liberalization Indian art thus works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it.  In this phase, artists have introduced even newer concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil.  Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into a fantastic images.\n\n==Vernacular Indian Painting==\n[[File:Ladoo-Bai-aux-museum-of-Tribal-Art-Bhopal.jpg|210px|Ladoo Bai (Bhil artiste) |alt=|thumb]]\nVernacular art is an art alive (contemporary art), based on the past (the myths, the traditions and the religion) and made by defined groups.
