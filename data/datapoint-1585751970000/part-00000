The corresponding movement in [[Slovakia]] was called [[Public Against Violence]] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Verejnos\u0165 proti n\u00e1siliu'' - VPN).\n\nThe Civic Forum's purpose was to unify the dissident forces in Czechoslovakia and to overthrow the Communist regime. In this, they succeeded when the Communists gave up power in November 1989 after only 10 days of protests.  Playwright [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], its leader and founder, was elected president on December 29, 1989. Although the Forum did not have a clear political strategy beyond the June 1990 elections, it campaigned successfully in March and April 1990 during the first free elections in Czechoslovakia since 1946.  Those elections garnered Civic Forum 36 percent of the vote, the highest that a Czechoslovakian party ever obtained in a free election.  This netted it 68 seats in the Chamber of Deputies; combined with Public Against Violence's 19 seats, it commanded a strong majority.\n\nThe Civic Forum had a very loose structure, and most of its (self-appointed) leaders came from [[Prague]]-based members of the [[Charter 77]] dissident movement. In December 1989, Jan Urban became the Forum's chairman after Havel's election as president. Urban served until June 1990, when he resigned, stating he did not want a rift between the organization and the president. On October 16, 1990, [[V\u00e1clav Klaus]] [[1990 Civic Forum leadership election|was elected its new chairman]]. Klaus's policies were opposed by other leading figures within the Forum and party unity soon vanished.\n\nAt the Civic Forum congress in January 1991, the movement divided.  The more right wing members, led by Klaus, declared that they would form an independent party, the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (''Ob\u010dansk\u00e1 demokratick\u00e1 strana''), with a clearer program advocating a [[free market]]. The party elected Klaus as its chairman in February 1991.  The more centrist members of Civic Forum, led by federal minister of foreign affairs [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Dienstbier]], formed the [[Civic Movement]] (''Ob\u010dansk\u00e9 hnut\u00ed'').  Klaus stated that the two parties would rule as a coalition until the 1992 elections.  However, by July 1991 Klaus declared the inter-party cooperation over. The Civic Democratic Party was victorious in the elections of 1992 while the Civic Movement failed to reach the 5% threshold to enter parliament and eventually disappeared.\n\n==Ideologic platforms==\n*[[Interparliamentary Club of the Democratic Right]] - rightist wing in the party.
