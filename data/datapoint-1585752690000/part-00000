The aircraft safely landed at [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]]. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived. An investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was a fuel leak in the number two engine which was caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff. The part did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line, allowing vibration in the hydraulic lines to degrade the fuel line and cause the leak. The aircraft involved in the incident was repaired and remains in service with Air Transat. The incident went down in history as the longest non-powered flight and landing by a commercial airliner.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/a330-glider-drama-facts-revealed-189183/ A330 'glider' drama facts revealed.] [[Flight International]], 26 Oct 2004.

The aircraft safely landed at [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]]. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived. An investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was a fuel leak in the number two engine which was caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff. The part did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line, allowing vibration in the hydraulic lines to degrade the fuel line and cause the leak. The aircraft involved in the incident was repaired and remains in service with Air Transat. The incident went down in history as the longest non-powered flight and landing by a commercial airliner.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/a330-glider-drama-facts-revealed-189183/ A330 'glider' drama facts revealed.] [[Flight International]], 26 Oct 2004.
