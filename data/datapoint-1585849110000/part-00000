Other bishops may be appointed to assist ordinaries ([[auxiliary bishop]]s and [[coadjutor bishop]]s) or to carry out a function in a broader field of service to the Church, such as appointments as [[papal nuncio]]s or as officials in the [[Roman Curia]].\n\nBishops of a country or region may form an [[episcopal conference]] and meet periodically to discuss current problems.

The honorific \"pope\" was from the early 3rd century used for any bishop in the West, and is known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as far back as Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' (6:57). In the East, \"pope\" is still a common form of address for clergy in the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and is the style of the Bishop of Alexandria. [[Pope Marcellinus]] (died 304) is the first Bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title \"pope\" used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome. From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century, when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} \n\nAs bishop of the Church of Rome, he is successor to the co-patrons of that local Church, [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507284/Roman-Catholicism Roman Catholicism] (at \"Structure of the Church: Apostolic Succession\").

As the [[Latin Church]] owes its identity and development to its origins in the liturgical, juridical, and theological patrimony of Rome, the bishop of Rome is de facto the [[patriarch]] of the [[Latin Church]]. According to Pope Benedict XVI, there has been much 'confusion' between the pope's primacy as patriarch of the western church and his primacy as first patriarch among equals, that this \"failure to distinguish\" between the roles and responsibilities of these two distinct positions leads in time to the \"extreme centralization of the Catholic Church\" and the schism between East and West.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeVille|first1=Adam A.J.|title=Orthodoxy and the Roman Papacy: Ut Unum Sint and the Prospects of East-West Unity|date=2011|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press}}</ref>\n\nAs the first local Church of Italy, the bishop of Rome is the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Italy and is empowered to appoint the president of the Italian Bishops' Conference.\n\nThe Church of Rome is also the principal church of the [[Ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Province]] of Rome, so the bishop of Rome is [[Metropolitan bishop|Archbishop and Metropolitan]] of the [[List of Catholic dioceses (structured view)#Ecclesiastical Province of Rome|Roman province]].\n\nAs a bishop, the pope is referred to as a [[Vicar of Christ]].

As popes were sovereigns of the [[papal states]] (754\u20131870), so do they exercise absolute civil authority in the microstate of [[Vatican City]] since 1929.\n\nAmbassadors are accredited not to the Vatican City State but to the ''Holy See,'' which was subject to international law even before the state was instituted. The body of officials that assist the Pope in governance of the Church as a whole is known as the [[Roman curia]]. The term \"Holy See\" (i.e. of Rome) is generally used only of the Pope and the curia, because the [[Code of Canon Law]], which concerns governance of the [[Latin Church]] as a whole and not internal affairs of the see (diocese) of Rome itself, necessarily uses the term in this technical sense.\n\nFinally, the title \"[[Servant of the servants of God]]\" was an addition of [[Pope Gregory the Great]], a reminder that in Christianity, leadership is always about service/ministry (''diakonia'').\n\nThe [[style (manner of address)|style]] of address for the bishop of Rome is \"His Holiness\".\n\n====Election====\n\nThe present rules governing the election of a pope are found in the apostolic constitution ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]''.<ref name=\"UDG\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |title=Apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis |accessdate=2007-04-20 |author=Pope John Paul II |date=February 22, 1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506074146/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |archivedate=May 6, 2007 |author-link=Pope John Paul II }}</ref> This deals with the powers, from the death of a pope to the announcement of his successor's election, of the cardinals and the departments of the Roman curia; with the funeral arrangements for the dead pope; and with the place, time and manner of voting of the meeting of the cardinal electors, a meeting known as a [[Papal conclave|conclave]]. This word is derived from Latin ''com-'' (together) and ''clavis'' (key) and refers to the locking away of the participants from outside influences, a measure that was introduced first as a means instead of forcing them to reach a decision.\n\nLike all bishops, the pope has the option of [[papal resignation|resigning]], though unlike other bishops, it is not required.

As a whole, the cardinals compose a [[College of Cardinals]] which advises the Pope, and those cardinals under the age of 80 at the death or resignation of a Pope [[Papal conclave|elect his successor]]. Their heraldic achievement is surmounted by the red [[galero]] and [[tassels]] as a form of martyred position in the Church.\n\nNot all cardinals are bishops. [[Domenico Bartolucci]], [[Karl Josef Becker]], [[Roberto Tucci]] and [[Albert Vanhoye]] are examples of 21st-century non-bishop cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law introduced the requirement that a cardinal must be at least a priest.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM Code of Canon Law (1917), canon 232 \u00a71]</ref> Previously, they need only be in [[minor orders]] and not even [[deacon]]s. [[Teodolfo Mertel]], who died in 1899, was the last non-priest cardinal. In 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] made it a rule that a man who has been nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already,<ref>Pope John XXIII (15 April 1962). \"Cum gravissima\".</ref> but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement. It is rare that the Pope will appoint Cardinals who are priests only and not consecrated as a bishop.\n\nThe 1917 Code of Canon Law, continuing the tradition observed, for instance, at the [[First Vatican Council]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/acommentaryonthe00bachuoft#page/36/mode/2up/search/precedence Chas. Augustine, ''A Commentary on the New Code of Canon Law'' (Herder 1918), book II, pp. 36\u201337]</ref> laid down that cardinals have [[Order of precedence in the Catholic Church|precedence]] over all other prelates, even patriarchs.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM Code of Canon Law (1917), canon 239 \u00a71 21\u00b0]</ref> The 1983 Code of Canon Law did not deal with questions of precedence.\n\nThe cardinalate is not an integral part of the theological structure of the Catholic Church, but largely an honorific distinction that has its origins in the 1059 assignation of the right of electing the Pope exclusively to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven [[suburbicarian diocese]]s.<ref name=BritannicaRomanCuria/> Because of their resulting importance, the term ''cardinal'' (from Latin ''cardo'', meaning \"hinge\") was applied to them. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began. Each cardinal is still assigned a church in Rome as his \"titular church\" or is linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses. Of these sees, the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] holds that of [[Bishop of Ostia|Ostia]], while keeping his preceding link with one of the other six sees. Traditionally, only six cardinals held the rank of [[Cardinal Bishop]], but when Eastern patriarchs are made cardinals, they too hold the rank of Cardinal Bishop, without being assigned a [[suburbicarian see]]. The other cardinals have the rank either of [[Cardinal Priest]] or [[Cardinal Deacon]], the former rank being normally assigned to bishops in charge of dioceses, and the latter to officials of the Curia and to priests raised to the cardinalate.\n\n===Primates===\nThe Latin Church title of [[primate (bishop)|primate]] has in some countries been granted to the bishop of a particular (usually metropolitan) see.<ref name=ce>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Primate}}</ref> It once involved authority over all the other sees in the country or region, but now only gives a \"prerogative of honor\" with no power of governance unless an exception is made in certain matters by a privilege granted by the Holy See or by an approved custom.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1I.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 438]</ref> The title is usually assigned to the [[#Ordinaries and local ordinaries|ordinary]] of the first diocese or the oldest archdiocese in the country.<ref name=ce/> Thus in [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Poland]], the primate is the archbishop of the oldest archdiocese ([[Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno]], founded in 1000), and not the oldest diocese ([[Diocese of Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144]], founded in 968).\n\nNotably, the [[Archbishop of Baltimore]] is not formally considered a primate of the [[Catholic Church in the United States]], but \"prerogative of the place\".\n\nThe closest equivalent position in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is an [[exarch]] holding authority over other bishops without being a patriarch.<ref name=ce/> In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], exarchs, whether apostolic or patriarchal, do not hold authority over other bishops (see below, [[#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law]]).\n\n===Metropolitan bishops===\n[[File:Archbishop-robert-carlson.jpg|right|thumb|Archbishop [[Robert James Carlson|Robert Carlson]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Metropolitan Archbishop of St. Louis]].

The metropolitan receives a [[pallium]] from the pope as a symbol of his office.\nThe metropolitan bishop has limited oversight authority over the [[suffragan diocese]]s in their province, including ensuring that the faith and ecclesiastical discipline are properly observed.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1J.HTM Canons 435\u2013437], ''Ibid.''</ref>  He also has the power to name a [[diocesan administrator]] for a [[sede vacante|vacant]] suffragan see if the diocesan council of consultors fails to properly elect one.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/ __P1H.HTM Canon 421 \u00a72], ''Ibid.''</ref>  His diocesan tribunal additionally serves by default as the ecclesiastical [[court of appeal]] for suffragans (court of second instance),<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P5F.HTM Canon 1438], ''Ibid.''</ref> and the metropolitan has the option of judging those appeals personally.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P5C.HTM Canon 1419 \u00a71], ''Ibid.''</ref>\n\nEastern metropolitans in patriarchal or major archiepiscopal churches have a level of authority similar to that of Latin metropolitans, subject to the specific laws and customs of their ''sui iuris'' church.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P3P.HTM Canons 133]-[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P3V.HTM 139], ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches''</ref> Eastern metropolitans who head a metropolitan ''sui iuris'' church have much greater authority within their church, although it is less than that of a major archbishop or patriarch.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P4B.HTM Canons 155]-[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P4T.HTM 173], ''Ibid''</ref>\n\nAll metropolitans have the title of [[Archbishop]], and the metropolitan see is usually referred to as an [[Archdiocese|archdiocese or archeparchy]], a title held not only by the 553 metropolitan sees but also by 77 other sees.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annuario Pontificio 2017|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|isbn=9788820999759|page=1136|year=2017}}</ref> An exception is the metropolitan [[Diocese of Rome]].\n\n===Archbishops===\nThe title of ''archbishop'' is held not only by bishops who head metropolitan sees, but also by those who head archdioceses that are not metropolitan sees (most of these are in [[Europe]] and the [[Levant]]<ref>According to [[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]], as of 2007, non-metropolitan archdioceses include [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview7.html 37 in Europe] (10 immediately subject to the Holy See, 1 immediately subject to an Eastern Catholic major archbishop, 25 suffragan archdioceses, and 1 military archdiocese), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview6.html 37 in Southwest Asia] (3 immediately subject to the Holy See, 21 immediately subject to Eastern Catholic patriarchs, 4 suffragan archdioceses), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview5.html 4 in Africa] (2 immediately subject to the Holy See, 2 immediately subject to Eastern Catholic patriarchs), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview1.html 2 in North America] (1 immediately subject to the Holy See, 1 military archdiocese), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview3.html 2 in South America] (1 immediately subject to the Holy See, 1 military archdiocese), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview4.html 2 in Australia] (both immediately subject to the Holy See), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview6.html 1 in Southeast Asia] (immediately subject to the Holy See), and [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview6.html 1 in South Asia] (immediately subject to an Eastern Catholic major archbishop)</ref>). In addition, it is held by certain other bishops, referred to as \"Titular Archbishops\" (see \"[[#Other bishops|Other Bishops]]\" below) who have been given no-longer-residential archdioceses as their titular sees\u2014many of these in administrative or diplomatic posts, for instance as [[papal nuncio]]s or secretaries of [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|curial congregation]]s. The bishop of a non-archiepiscopal see may be given the personal title of archbishop without also elevating his see (such a bishop is known as an [[archbishop#Archbishops ad personam|archbishop ''ad personam'']]), though this practice has seen significantly reduced usage since the [[Second Vatican Council]].\n\n===Diocesan bishops===\nThe bishop or eparch of a see, even if he does not also hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is the centre of unity for his [[diocese]] or [[eparchy]], and, as a member of the College of Bishops, shares in responsibility for governance of the whole Church (cf. ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, not just an administrative subdivision of something larger, the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.\n\nWithin each diocese, even if the [[Eucharist]] is celebrated by another bishop, the necessary communion with the Bishop of the diocese is signified by the mention of his name. In Eastern eparchies the name of the patriarch, major archbishop or metropolitan is also mentioned, because these also have direct responsibility within all the eparchies of the particular Church in question. For the same reason, every Catholic celebration of the Eucharist has a mention of the Pope by name.\n\nOrdination to the episcopate is the fullness of the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] and the completion of the sacrament of [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]]. Bishops are considered the successors of the apostles.\n\nWithin the Catholic Church the following posts have similarities to that of a diocesan bishop, but are not necessarily held by a bishop.\n\n====Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law<!--linked from 'Military ordinariate'-->====\n{{canon law}}\nCanon 368 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] lists five Latin Church jurisdictional areas that are considered equivalent to a diocese. These are headed by:\n*A [[territorial prelature|Territorial Prelate]], formerly called a Prelate ''nullius dioceseos'' (of no diocese), in charge of a geographical area that has not yet been raised to the level of diocese\n*A [[territorial abbey|Territorial Abbot]], in charge of an area, which in mission countries can be quite vast, associated with an abbey\n*A [[apostolic vicar|Vicar Apostolic]] (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic vicariate, usually in a mission country, not yet ready to be made a diocese\n*A [[apostolic prefecture|Prefect Apostolic]] (usually not a bishop), in charge of an apostolic prefecture, not yet ready to be made an apostolic vicariate\n*A [[apostolic administrator|Permanent Apostolic Administrator]], in charge of a geographical area that for serious reasons cannot be made a diocese.\n\nTo these may be added:\n*An [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|Apostolic Exarch]] (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic exarchate\u2014not yet ready to be made an eparchy\u2014for the faithful of an [[Eastern Catholic Church]] in an area that is situated outside the home territory of that Eastern Church.\n*A [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|Patriarchal Exarch]], a bishop in charge of a patriarchal exarchate\u2014not yet ready to be made an eparchy\u2014for the faithful of an [[Eastern Catholic Church]] in an area situated within the home territory of that patriarchal Eastern Church.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_VIII Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 314 \u00a71] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html |date=2011-06-04 }}; cf.

Apart from certain limitations of nature and law, he has, on a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a Diocesan Bishop (canons 427\u2013429 of the ''Code of Canon Law''). Occasionally an [[Apostolic Administrator]] is appointed by the Holy See to run a [[Sede vacante|vacant diocese]], or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.\n\n===Other bishops===\nA Diocesan Bishop may have bishops who assist in his ministry. The [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of a see has the right of succession on the death or resignation of the Diocesan Bishop, and, if the see is an archdiocese, holds the title of Archbishop. Similarly, a retired Diocesan Bishop keeps his connection with the see to which he was appointed, and is known as Bishop (or Archbishop) [[Emeritus]] of that see. On the other hand, an [[Auxiliary Bishop]], who may also hold posts such as [[vicar general]] or [[episcopal vicar]], is appointed bishop of a [[titular see]], a see that in the course of history has ceased to exist as an actual jurisdictional unit.\n\nThe titular sees\u2014which may be archiepiscopal or simply episcopal\u2014assigned to such bishops were once known as sees ''in partibus infidelium'', because they were situated in areas lost to Christianity as a result of Muslim conquests. Now former sees even in Christian countries are assigned as titular sees. These sees are also assigned to bishops who serve in the [[Roman Curia]], as [[Papal Nuncio]]s, or as equivalents of Diocesan Bishops in law (see above), such as Vicars Apostolic and Apostolic Exarchs.\n\nThe term \"Titular Bishop\" is frequently used for such bishops, but is, strictly speaking, inaccurate, since they are indeed bishops, even if they do not serve the see to which they are appointed, and are not merely holders of an honorary title of bishop. They are members of the College of Bishops as much as the Diocesan Bishops.\n\nIn most English-speaking countries, the honorary title prefixed to the name of a bishop is \"The Most Reverend\". However, in the United Kingdom and in those countries most strongly influenced by English (not Irish) practice, \"The Most Reverend\" is reserved for archbishops, and other bishops are called \"The Right Reverend\".\n\nImportant titles or functions usually, but not necessarily, held by (arch)bishops who are not in charge of a diocese or an equivalent community include those of [[Apostolic Delegate]], [[Apostolic Nuncio]], [[Papal Legate]], [[Patriarchal Vicar]], [[Pontifical Delegate]].\n\n==Ordinaries and local ordinaries==\n{{anchor|Ordinary}}<!--[[Ordinary (Catholic Church)]] redirects here-->{{main article|Ordinary (officer)}}\nLocal ordinaries are placed over or exercise ordinary executive power in [[particular church]]es or equivalent communities.<ref>''Id''.[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.134 c.134 &sect;&sect;1&ndash;2]</ref>\n*The Supreme Pontiff (the [[Pope]]) is a local ordinary for the whole [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canon 134, \u00a71 and \u00a72|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/ __P1D.HTM|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|work=1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]]|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 43 and 45] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html |date=2011-06-04 }}</ref>\n*In [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Patriarch]]s, [[major archbishop]]s, and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s have ordinary power of governance for the whole territory of their respective autonomous particular churches.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 78, 152 and 157] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html |date=2011-06-04 }}</ref>\n*[[diocese|Diocesan]]  [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s and [[eparchy|eparchial]] [[eparchy|eparchs]]\n*Other [[prelate]]s who head, even if only temporarily, a [[particular church]] or a community equivalent to it (see above [[#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law]])\n*[[vicar general|Vicars general]] and [[Protosyncellus|protosyncelli]]\n:{{main article|Vicar general}}\n*[[vicar general|Episcopal vicars]] and [[Protosyncellus|syncelli]]\n:{{main article|Vicar general}}\n\nMajor superiors of [[religious institute]]s (including [[abbot]]s) and of [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are ordinaries of their respective memberships, but not local ordinaries.\n\n==Presbyterate==\n{{main article|Priesthood in the Catholic Church}}\n\n===In general===\nBishops are assisted by [[priest]]s<ref name=BritannicaPriesthood>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507284/Roman-Catholicism Roman Catholicism] (at \"Structure of the Church: The priesthood\").

[[Parish#Roman Catholic Church|Parishes]], whether territorial or person-based, within a diocese are normally in the charge of a priest, known as the parish priest or the pastor.<ref name=BritannicaPriesthood/>\n\nIn the Latin Church, only celibate men, as a rule, are ordained as priests, while the Eastern Churches, again as a rule, ordain both celibate and married men. Among the Eastern particular Churches, the [[Ethiopic Catholic Church]] ordains only celibate clergy, while also having married priests who were ordained in the Orthodox Church, while other Eastern Catholic Churches, which do ordain married men, do not have married priests in certain countries. The Western or Latin Church does sometimes, though rarely, ordain married men, usually Protestant clergy who have become Catholics. All [[sui iuris]] Churches of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, following ordination, marriage is not allowed. Even a married priest whose wife dies may not then marry again.\n\nThe Catholic Church and the ancient Christian Churches see priestly ordination as a [[sacrament]] dedicating the ordinand to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on him. It is for this reason that a person may be ordained to each of the three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.\n\n===Priests in service outside their diocese===\nAlthough priests are incardinated into a diocese or order, they may obtain the permission of their diocesan ordinary or religious superior to serve outside the normal jurisdiction of the diocese or order. These assignments may be temporary or more permanent in nature.\n\nTemporary assignments may include studying for an advanced degree at a [[Pontifical University]] in Rome. They may also include short-term assignments to the faculty of a [[seminary]] located outside the diocese's territory.\n\nLong-term assignments include serving the universal church on the staff of a [[dicastery]] or tribunal of the [[Roman Curia]] or in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See. They may also be appointed the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] or to long-term teaching assignments to the faculty of a seminary or Catholic university. Priests may also serve on the staff of their [[episcopal conference]], as [[military chaplain]]s in the [[military ordinariate]]s, or as [[missionary|missionaries]].\n\n===Positions within a diocese at diocesan level===\nThe diocesan bishop appoints a [[vicar general]] to assist him in the governance of the diocese. Usually, only one vicar general is appointed; particularly large dioceses may have more than one vicar general. The vicar general or one of them is usually appointed [[moderator of the curia]] who coordinates the diocesan administrative offices and ministries.<ref name=\"Canon 475, canon 473\">{{Cite book\n |title=1983 Code of Canon Law \n |chapter-url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1O.HTM \n |accessdate=2009-08-20 \n |date=1983-01-28 \n |publisher=The [[Holy See]] \n |isbn=0-943616-79-4 \n |chapter=Canon 475 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012061518/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1O.HTM \n |archivedate=2007-10-12 \n}}</ref> A diocesan bishop can also appoint one or more [[episcopal vicar]]s for the diocese.

In the Eastern Catholic Churches, they are called protosyncelli and syncelli (canon 191 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'').\n\nDiocesan bishops are required to appoint a [[judicial vicar]] to whom is delegated the bishop's ordinary power to judge cases (canon 1420 of the ''Code of Canon Law'', canon 191 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches''). In the Latin church, the judicial vicar may also be called ''[[officialis]]''. The person holding this post must be a priest, have earned a [[Doctor of Canon Law|doctorate in canon law]] (or at least a [[license]]), be at least thirty years old, and, unless the smallness of the diocese or the limited number of cases suggests otherwise, must not be the vicar general. As one of the jobs of the judicial vicar is to preside over collegiate tribunals, many dioceses have adjutant judicial vicars who can preside over collegiate tribunals in place of the judicial vicar and must have the same qualifications.\n\nThe diocesan bishop appoints a [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]], possibly a vice-chancellor, and notaries to the [[diocesan chancery]]. These officials maintain the records and archives of the diocese. They also serve as the secretaries of the diocesan [[curia]]. The bishop also appoints a finance officer and a finance council to oversee the budget, temporal goods, income, and expenses of the diocese.\n\nThe diocesan bishop may appoint priests to be members of the [[cathedral chapter|chapter of his cathedral]] or of a [[collegiate church]] (so called after their chapter). These priests are given the title of [[Canon (priest)|canon]]. He also appoints six to twelve priests from the presbyteral council to serve as a college of [[consultors]].  They have the responsibility to elect the [[diocesan administrator]] in the event of the vacancy of the see.\n\nThe bishop appoints priests and other members of the faithful to various advisory bodies. These include the presbyteral council, the diocesan [[synod]], and the pastoral council.\n\n===Vicars Forane or Deans===\n\"The [[Vicar Forane]] known also as the [[dean (religion)|Dean]] or the Archpriest or by some other title, is the priest who is placed in charge of a vicariate forane\" (canon 553 of the ''Code of Canon Law''), namely of a group of parishes within a diocese. Unlike a regional Episcopal Vicar, a Vicar Forane acts as a help for the Parish Priests and other priests in the vicariate forane, rather than as an intermediate authority between them and the Diocesan Bishop.\n\n===Parish priest/pastor===\nThis section concerns the priest who in the Code of Canon Law is referred to by the term ''parochus'', which in some English-speaking countries is rendered as \"the parish priest\", in others as \"the pastor\". The English term \"pastor\" is also used in a more generic sense corresponding instead to the Latin term ''pastor'':\n\n<blockquote>The parish priest is the proper pastor of the parish entrusted to him. He exercises the pastoral care of the community entrusted to him under the authority of the diocesan Bishop, whose ministry of Christ he is called to share, so that for this community he may carry out the offices of teaching, sanctifying and ruling with the cooperation of other priests or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of Christ's faithful, in accordance with the law\n:\u2014canon 519 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, assisted by the Canon Law Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Canadian Canon Law Society</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The pastor (''parochus'') is the proper pastor (''pastor'') of the parish entrusted to him, exercising the pastoral care of the community committed to him under the authority of the diocesan bishop in whose ministry of Christ he has been called to share, so that for that same community he carries out the functions of teaching, sanctifying, and governing, also with the cooperation of other presbyters or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of the Christian faithful, according to the norm of law\n:\u2014canon 519 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of America).</blockquote>\n\n===Assistant priests/parochial vicars===\nThe parish priest/pastor may be assisted by one or more other priests:\n\n<blockquote>Whenever it is necessary or opportune for the due pastoral care of the parish, one or more assistant priests can be joined with the parish priest. As cooperators with the parish priest and sharers in his concern, they are, by common counsel and effort with the parish priest and under his authority, to labour in the pastoral ministry\n:\u2014canon 545 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, assisted by the Canon Law Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Canadian Canon Law Society</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Whenever it is necessary or opportune in order to carry out the pastoral care of a parish fittingly, one or more parochial vicars can be associated with the pastor. As co-workers with the pastor and sharers in his solicitude, they are to offer service in the pastoral ministry by common counsel and effort with the pastor and under his authority\n:\u2014canon 545 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of America</blockquote>\n\n===Honorary titles===\nThe honorary title of ''[[monsignor]]'' is conferred by the Pope upon diocesan priests (not members of [[religious institute]]s) in the service of the [[Holy See]], and may be granted by him also to other diocesan priests at the request of the priest's bishop. The priest so honored is considered to be a member of the [[papal household]]. The title goes with any of the following three awards:\n\n* ''[[Chaplain of His Holiness]]'' (called ''Papal Chamberlain'' until a 1969 reform),<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church \u2013 Guide]</ref> the lowest level, distinguished by purple buttons and trim on the black [[cassock]], with a purple sash.\n* ''[[Honorary Prelate]]'' (until 1969 called ''Domestic Prelate''), the middle level, distinguished by red buttons and trim on the black cassock, with a purple sash, and by choir dress that includes a purple cassock.\n* ''[[Protonotary Apostolic]]'', the highest level, with the same dress as that of an Honorary Prelate, except that the non-obligatory purple silk cape known as a [[ferraiolo]] may be worn also.\n\nIn December 2013, [[Pope Francis]] decided to make future grants of the title of ''Monsignor'' to priests not in the service of the Holy See only in the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness and only to priests aged 65 or over.<ref>{{cite news| last = O'Connell | first = Gerard| title= Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65 |url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 | newspaper =Vatican Insider|date=4 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nUnder legislation of [[Pope Pius X]], [[vicar general|vicars general]] and [[vicar capitular|vicars capitular]] (the latter are now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries ''durante munere'', i.e., as long as they hold those offices, and so are entitled to be addressed as Monsignor,<ref>\"Pariter, qui vicarii generalis aut etiam capitularis munere fungitur, hoc munere dumtaxat perdurante, erit protonotarius titularis\" (Pope Pius X, ''Inter multiplices curas'', 62. 21 February 1905)</ref> as indicated also by the placing of the abbreviated title \"Mons\", before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]''. (Honorary titles such as that of \"Monsignor\" are not considered appropriate for [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]].)\n\nSome of the Eastern Catholic Churches of Syriac tradition use the title ''[[Chorbishop]]'', roughly equivalent to the Western title of ''Monsignor''. Other Eastern Catholic Churches bestow the honorific title of ''[[Archimandrite]]'' upon unmarried priests as a mark of respect or gratitude for their services. Married presbyters may be honored with the position of ''[[Archpriest]]'', which has two grades, the higher is \"Mitred Archpriest\" which permits the priest to wear a mitre.\n\nIn the Latin Church titles of [[Archpriest]] is sometimes attached to the pastor of a few number of historic churches including the major basilicas in Rome.  These archpriests are not presbyters, but bishops or cardinals.<ref>See [[Archpriest#Roman Catholicism]].</ref> Similarly, the title of [[Archdeacon]] is sometimes conferred on presbyters.\n\n==Diaconate==\n[[Deacons]] are ordained ministers of the Church who are co-workers with the bishop alongside presbyters, but are intended to focus on the ministries of direct service and outreach to the poor and needy, rather than pastoral leadership. They are usually related to a parish, where they have a liturgical function as the ordinary minister of the [[Gospel]] and the Prayers of the Faithful, They may preach [[homilies]], and in the [[Roman Rite]] may preside at non-Eucharistic liturgies such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, and adoration/benediction. In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], in the absence of a priest, deacons do not vest and may only lead services as a reader, never presiding at weddings or funerals.\n\nThe scriptural basis and description of the role and qualifications of the deacon can be found in Acts 6:1\u20139, and in 1 Timothy 3:1\u201313.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stbrendanchurch.org/deacon/scripture.html |title=The Deacon |publisher=St. Brendan Church |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThey may be seminarians preparing for ordination to the priesthood, \"transitional deacons\", or \"permanent deacons\" who do not intend to be ordained as priests. To be ordained deacons, the latter must be at least 25 years old, if unmarried; if married, a prospective deacon must be at least 35 years old and have the consent of his wife. In the Latin Church, married deacons are permanent deacons. In most diocese there is a cut-off age for being accepted into formation for the diaconate.\n\nThe passage from membership of the laity to that of the clergy occurs with ordination to the diaconate.<ref name=canon266>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PX.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 266]</ref> Previously, the [[Latin Church]] rule was that one became a cleric on receiving clerical [[tonsure]], which was followed by [[minor orders]] and by the [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]], which was reckoned as one of the [[major orders]].

Other bishops may be appointed to assist ordinaries ([[auxiliary bishop]]s and [[coadjutor bishop]]s) or to carry out a function in a broader field of service to the Church, such as appointments as [[papal nuncio]]s or as officials in the [[Roman Curia]].\n\nBishops of a country or region may form an [[episcopal conference]] and meet periodically to discuss current problems.

The honorific \"pope\" was from the early 3rd century used for any bishop in the West, and is known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as far back as Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' (6:57). In the East, \"pope\" is still a common form of address for clergy in the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and is the style of the Bishop of Alexandria. [[Pope Marcellinus]] (died 304) is the first Bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title \"pope\" used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome. From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century, when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} \n\nAs bishop of the Church of Rome, he is successor to the co-patrons of that local Church, [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507284/Roman-Catholicism Roman Catholicism] (at \"Structure of the Church: Apostolic Succession\").

As the [[Latin Church]] owes its identity and development to its origins in the liturgical, juridical, and theological patrimony of Rome, the bishop of Rome is de facto the [[patriarch]] of the [[Latin Church]]. According to Pope Benedict XVI, there has been much 'confusion' between the pope's primacy as patriarch of the western church and his primacy as first patriarch among equals, that this \"failure to distinguish\" between the roles and responsibilities of these two distinct positions leads in time to the \"extreme centralization of the Catholic Church\" and the schism between East and West.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeVille|first1=Adam A.J.|title=Orthodoxy and the Roman Papacy: Ut Unum Sint and the Prospects of East-West Unity|date=2011|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press}}</ref>\n\nAs the first local Church of Italy, the bishop of Rome is the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Italy and is empowered to appoint the president of the Italian Bishops' Conference.\n\nThe Church of Rome is also the principal church of the [[Ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Province]] of Rome, so the bishop of Rome is [[Metropolitan bishop|Archbishop and Metropolitan]] of the [[List of Catholic dioceses (structured view)#Ecclesiastical Province of Rome|Roman province]].\n\nAs a bishop, the pope is referred to as a [[Vicar of Christ]].

The body of officials that assist the Pope in governance of the Church as a whole is known as the [[Roman curia]]. The term \"Holy See\" (i.e. of Rome) is generally used only of the Pope and the curia, because the [[Code of Canon Law]], which concerns governance of the [[Latin Church]] as a whole and not internal affairs of the see (diocese) of Rome itself, necessarily uses the term in this technical sense.\n\nFinally, the title \"[[Servant of the servants of God]]\" was an addition of [[Pope Gregory the Great]], a reminder that in Christianity, leadership is always about service/ministry (''diakonia'').\n\nThe [[style (manner of address)|style]] of address for the bishop of Rome is \"His Holiness\".\n\n====Election====\n\nThe present rules governing the election of a pope are found in the apostolic constitution ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]''.<ref name=\"UDG\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |title=Apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis |accessdate=2007-04-20 |author=Pope John Paul II |date=February 22, 1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506074146/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |archivedate=May 6, 2007 |author-link=Pope John Paul II }}</ref> This deals with the powers, from the death of a pope to the announcement of his successor's election, of the cardinals and the departments of the Roman curia; with the funeral arrangements for the dead pope; and with the place, time and manner of voting of the meeting of the cardinal electors, a meeting known as a [[Papal conclave|conclave]].

Augustine, ''A Commentary on the New Code of Canon Law'' (Herder 1918), book II, pp. 36\u201337]</ref> laid down that cardinals have [[Order of precedence in the Catholic Church|precedence]] over all other prelates, even patriarchs.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM Code of Canon Law (1917), canon 239 \u00a71 21\u00b0]</ref> The 1983 Code of Canon Law did not deal with questions of precedence.\n\nThe cardinalate is not an integral part of the theological structure of the Catholic Church, but largely an honorific distinction that has its origins in the 1059 assignation of the right of electing the Pope exclusively to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven [[suburbicarian diocese]]s.<ref name=BritannicaRomanCuria/> Because of their resulting importance, the term ''cardinal'' (from Latin ''cardo'', meaning \"hinge\") was applied to them. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began. Each cardinal is still assigned a church in Rome as his \"titular church\" or is linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses. Of these sees, the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] holds that of [[Bishop of Ostia|Ostia]], while keeping his preceding link with one of the other six sees. Traditionally, only six cardinals held the rank of [[Cardinal Bishop]], but when Eastern patriarchs are made cardinals, they too hold the rank of Cardinal Bishop, without being assigned a [[suburbicarian see]]. The other cardinals have the rank either of [[Cardinal Priest]] or [[Cardinal Deacon]], the former rank being normally assigned to bishops in charge of dioceses, and the latter to officials of the Curia and to priests raised to the cardinalate.\n\n===Primates===\nThe Latin Church title of [[primate (bishop)|primate]] has in some countries been granted to the bishop of a particular (usually metropolitan) see.<ref name=ce>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Primate}}</ref> It once involved authority over all the other sees in the country or region, but now only gives a \"prerogative of honor\" with no power of governance unless an exception is made in certain matters by a privilege granted by the Holy See or by an approved custom.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1I.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 438]</ref> The title is usually assigned to the [[#Ordinaries and local ordinaries|ordinary]] of the first diocese or the oldest archdiocese in the country.<ref name=ce/> Thus in [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Poland]], the primate is the archbishop of the oldest archdiocese ([[Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno]], founded in 1000), and not the oldest diocese ([[Diocese of Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144]], founded in 968).\n\nNotably, the [[Archbishop of Baltimore]] is not formally considered a primate of the [[Catholic Church in the United States]], but \"prerogative of the place\".\n\nThe closest equivalent position in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is an [[exarch]] holding authority over other bishops without being a patriarch.<ref name=ce/> In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], exarchs, whether apostolic or patriarchal, do not hold authority over other bishops (see below, [[#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law]]).\n\n===Metropolitan bishops===\n[[File:Archbishop-robert-carlson.jpg|right|thumb|Archbishop [[Robert James Carlson|Robert Carlson]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Metropolitan Archbishop of St. Louis]].

In addition, it is held by certain other bishops, referred to as \"Titular Archbishops\" (see \"[[#Other bishops|Other Bishops]]\" below) who have been given no-longer-residential archdioceses as their titular sees\u2014many of these in administrative or diplomatic posts, for instance as [[papal nuncio]]s or secretaries of [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|curial congregation]]s. The bishop of a non-archiepiscopal see may be given the personal title of archbishop without also elevating his see (such a bishop is known as an [[archbishop#Archbishops ad personam|archbishop ''ad personam'']]), though this practice has seen significantly reduced usage since the [[Second Vatican Council]].\n\n===Diocesan bishops===\nThe bishop or eparch of a see, even if he does not also hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is the centre of unity for his [[diocese]] or [[eparchy]], and, as a member of the College of Bishops, shares in responsibility for governance of the whole Church (cf. ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, not just an administrative subdivision of something larger, the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.\n\nWithin each diocese, even if the [[Eucharist]] is celebrated by another bishop, the necessary communion with the Bishop of the diocese is signified by the mention of his name. In Eastern eparchies the name of the patriarch, major archbishop or metropolitan is also mentioned, because these also have direct responsibility within all the eparchies of the particular Church in question. For the same reason, every Catholic celebration of the Eucharist has a mention of the Pope by name.\n\nOrdination to the episcopate is the fullness of the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] and the completion of the sacrament of [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]]. Bishops are considered the successors of the apostles.\n\nWithin the Catholic Church the following posts have similarities to that of a diocesan bishop, but are not necessarily held by a bishop.\n\n====Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law<!--linked from 'Military ordinariate'-->====\n{{canon law}}\nCanon 368 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] lists five Latin Church jurisdictional areas that are considered equivalent to a diocese. These are headed by:\n*A [[territorial prelature|Territorial Prelate]], formerly called a Prelate ''nullius dioceseos'' (of no diocese), in charge of a geographical area that has not yet been raised to the level of diocese\n*A [[territorial abbey|Territorial Abbot]], in charge of an area, which in mission countries can be quite vast, associated with an abbey\n*A [[apostolic vicar|Vicar Apostolic]] (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic vicariate, usually in a mission country, not yet ready to be made a diocese\n*A [[apostolic prefecture|Prefect Apostolic]] (usually not a bishop), in charge of an apostolic prefecture, not yet ready to be made an apostolic vicariate\n*A [[apostolic administrator|Permanent Apostolic Administrator]], in charge of a geographical area that for serious reasons cannot be made a diocese.\n\nTo these may be added:\n*An [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|Apostolic Exarch]] (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic exarchate\u2014not yet ready to be made an eparchy\u2014for the faithful of an [[Eastern Catholic Church]] in an area that is situated outside the home territory of that Eastern Church.\n*A [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|Patriarchal Exarch]], a bishop in charge of a patriarchal exarchate\u2014not yet ready to be made an eparchy\u2014for the faithful of an [[Eastern Catholic Church]] in an area situated within the home territory of that patriarchal Eastern Church.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_VIII Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 314 \u00a71] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html |date=2011-06-04 }}; cf.

Apart from certain limitations of nature and law, he has, on a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a Diocesan Bishop (canons 427\u2013429 of the ''Code of Canon Law''). Occasionally an [[Apostolic Administrator]] is appointed by the Holy See to run a [[Sede vacante|vacant diocese]], or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.\n\n===Other bishops===\nA Diocesan Bishop may have bishops who assist in his ministry. The [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of a see has the right of succession on the death or resignation of the Diocesan Bishop, and, if the see is an archdiocese, holds the title of Archbishop. Similarly, a retired Diocesan Bishop keeps his connection with the see to which he was appointed, and is known as Bishop (or Archbishop) [[Emeritus]] of that see. On the other hand, an [[Auxiliary Bishop]], who may also hold posts such as [[vicar general]] or [[episcopal vicar]], is appointed bishop of a [[titular see]], a see that in the course of history has ceased to exist as an actual jurisdictional unit.\n\nThe titular sees\u2014which may be archiepiscopal or simply episcopal\u2014assigned to such bishops were once known as sees ''in partibus infidelium'', because they were situated in areas lost to Christianity as a result of Muslim conquests. Now former sees even in Christian countries are assigned as titular sees. These sees are also assigned to bishops who serve in the [[Roman Curia]], as [[Papal Nuncio]]s, or as equivalents of Diocesan Bishops in law (see above), such as Vicars Apostolic and Apostolic Exarchs.\n\nThe term \"Titular Bishop\" is frequently used for such bishops, but is, strictly speaking, inaccurate, since they are indeed bishops, even if they do not serve the see to which they are appointed, and are not merely holders of an honorary title of bishop. They are members of the College of Bishops as much as the Diocesan Bishops.\n\nIn most English-speaking countries, the honorary title prefixed to the name of a bishop is \"The Most Reverend\". However, in the United Kingdom and in those countries most strongly influenced by English (not Irish) practice, \"The Most Reverend\" is reserved for archbishops, and other bishops are called \"The Right Reverend\".\n\nImportant titles or functions usually, but not necessarily, held by (arch)bishops who are not in charge of a diocese or an equivalent community include those of [[Apostolic Delegate]], [[Apostolic Nuncio]], [[Papal Legate]], [[Patriarchal Vicar]], [[Pontifical Delegate]].\n\n==Ordinaries and local ordinaries==\n{{anchor|Ordinary}}<!--[[Ordinary (Catholic Church)]] redirects here-->{{main article|Ordinary (officer)}}\nLocal ordinaries are placed over or exercise ordinary executive power in [[particular church]]es or equivalent communities.<ref>''Id''.[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.134 c.134 &sect;&sect;1&ndash;2]</ref>\n*The Supreme Pontiff (the [[Pope]]) is a local ordinary for the whole [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canon 134, \u00a71 and \u00a72|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/ __P1D.HTM|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|work=1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]]|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 43 and 45] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html |date=2011-06-04 }}</ref>\n*In [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Patriarch]]s, [[major archbishop]]s, and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s have ordinary power of governance for the whole territory of their respective autonomous particular churches.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 78, 152 and 157] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html |date=2011-06-04 }}</ref>\n*[[diocese|Diocesan]]  [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s and [[eparchy|eparchial]] [[eparchy|eparchs]]\n*Other [[prelate]]s who head, even if only temporarily, a [[particular church]] or a community equivalent to it (see above [[#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law]])\n*[[vicar general|Vicars general]] and [[Protosyncellus|protosyncelli]]\n:{{main article|Vicar general}}\n*[[vicar general|Episcopal vicars]] and [[Protosyncellus|syncelli]]\n:{{main article|Vicar general}}\n\nMajor superiors of [[religious institute]]s (including [[abbot]]s) and of [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are ordinaries of their respective memberships, but not local ordinaries.\n\n==Presbyterate==\n{{main article|Priesthood in the Catholic Church}}\n\n===In general===\nBishops are assisted by [[priest]]s<ref name=BritannicaPriesthood>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507284/Roman-Catholicism Roman Catholicism] (at \"Structure of the Church: The priesthood\").

[[Parish#Roman Catholic Church|Parishes]], whether territorial or person-based, within a diocese are normally in the charge of a priest, known as the parish priest or the pastor.<ref name=BritannicaPriesthood/>\n\nIn the Latin Church, only celibate men, as a rule, are ordained as priests, while the Eastern Churches, again as a rule, ordain both celibate and married men. Among the Eastern particular Churches, the [[Ethiopic Catholic Church]] ordains only celibate clergy, while also having married priests who were ordained in the Orthodox Church, while other Eastern Catholic Churches, which do ordain married men, do not have married priests in certain countries. The Western or Latin Church does sometimes, though rarely, ordain married men, usually Protestant clergy who have become Catholics. All [[sui iuris]] Churches of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, following ordination, marriage is not allowed. Even a married priest whose wife dies may not then marry again.\n\nThe Catholic Church and the ancient Christian Churches see priestly ordination as a [[sacrament]] dedicating the ordinand to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on him. It is for this reason that a person may be ordained to each of the three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.\n\n===Priests in service outside their diocese===\nAlthough priests are incardinated into a diocese or order, they may obtain the permission of their diocesan ordinary or religious superior to serve outside the normal jurisdiction of the diocese or order. These assignments may be temporary or more permanent in nature.\n\nTemporary assignments may include studying for an advanced degree at a [[Pontifical University]] in Rome. They may also include short-term assignments to the faculty of a [[seminary]] located outside the diocese's territory.\n\nLong-term assignments include serving the universal church on the staff of a [[dicastery]] or tribunal of the [[Roman Curia]] or in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See. They may also be appointed the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] or to long-term teaching assignments to the faculty of a seminary or Catholic university. Priests may also serve on the staff of their [[episcopal conference]], as [[military chaplain]]s in the [[military ordinariate]]s, or as [[missionary|missionaries]].\n\n===Positions within a diocese at diocesan level===\nThe diocesan bishop appoints a [[vicar general]] to assist him in the governance of the diocese. Usually, only one vicar general is appointed; particularly large dioceses may have more than one vicar general. The vicar general or one of them is usually appointed [[moderator of the curia]] who coordinates the diocesan administrative offices and ministries.<ref name=\"Canon 475, canon 473\">{{Cite book\n |title=1983 Code of Canon Law \n |chapter-url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1O.HTM \n |accessdate=2009-08-20 \n |date=1983-01-28 \n |publisher=The [[Holy See]] \n |isbn=0-943616-79-4 \n |chapter=Canon 475 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012061518/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1O.HTM \n |archivedate=2007-10-12 \n}}</ref> A diocesan bishop can also appoint one or more [[episcopal vicar]]s for the diocese.

In the Eastern Catholic Churches, they are called protosyncelli and syncelli (canon 191 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'').\n\nDiocesan bishops are required to appoint a [[judicial vicar]] to whom is delegated the bishop's ordinary power to judge cases (canon 1420 of the ''Code of Canon Law'', canon 191 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches''). In the Latin church, the judicial vicar may also be called ''[[officialis]]''. The person holding this post must be a priest, have earned a [[Doctor of Canon Law|doctorate in canon law]] (or at least a [[license]]), be at least thirty years old, and, unless the smallness of the diocese or the limited number of cases suggests otherwise, must not be the vicar general. As one of the jobs of the judicial vicar is to preside over collegiate tribunals, many dioceses have adjutant judicial vicars who can preside over collegiate tribunals in place of the judicial vicar and must have the same qualifications.\n\nThe diocesan bishop appoints a [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]], possibly a vice-chancellor, and notaries to the [[diocesan chancery]]. These officials maintain the records and archives of the diocese. They also serve as the secretaries of the diocesan [[curia]]. The bishop also appoints a finance officer and a finance council to oversee the budget, temporal goods, income, and expenses of the diocese.\n\nThe diocesan bishop may appoint priests to be members of the [[cathedral chapter|chapter of his cathedral]] or of a [[collegiate church]] (so called after their chapter). These priests are given the title of [[Canon (priest)|canon]]. He also appoints six to twelve priests from the presbyteral council to serve as a college of [[consultors]].  They have the responsibility to elect the [[diocesan administrator]] in the event of the vacancy of the see.\n\nThe bishop appoints priests and other members of the faithful to various advisory bodies. These include the presbyteral council, the diocesan [[synod]], and the pastoral council.\n\n===Vicars Forane or Deans===\n\"The [[Vicar Forane]] known also as the [[dean (religion)|Dean]] or the Archpriest or by some other title, is the priest who is placed in charge of a vicariate forane\" (canon 553 of the ''Code of Canon Law''), namely of a group of parishes within a diocese. Unlike a regional Episcopal Vicar, a Vicar Forane acts as a help for the Parish Priests and other priests in the vicariate forane, rather than as an intermediate authority between them and the Diocesan Bishop.\n\n===Parish priest/pastor===\nThis section concerns the priest who in the Code of Canon Law is referred to by the term ''parochus'', which in some English-speaking countries is rendered as \"the parish priest\", in others as \"the pastor\". The English term \"pastor\" is also used in a more generic sense corresponding instead to the Latin term ''pastor'':\n\n<blockquote>The parish priest is the proper pastor of the parish entrusted to him. He exercises the pastoral care of the community entrusted to him under the authority of the diocesan Bishop, whose ministry of Christ he is called to share, so that for this community he may carry out the offices of teaching, sanctifying and ruling with the cooperation of other priests or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of Christ's faithful, in accordance with the law\n:\u2014canon 519 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, assisted by the Canon Law Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Canadian Canon Law Society</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The pastor (''parochus'') is the proper pastor (''pastor'') of the parish entrusted to him, exercising the pastoral care of the community committed to him under the authority of the diocesan bishop in whose ministry of Christ he has been called to share, so that for that same community he carries out the functions of teaching, sanctifying, and governing, also with the cooperation of other presbyters or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of the Christian faithful, according to the norm of law\n:\u2014canon 519 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of America).</blockquote>\n\n===Assistant priests/parochial vicars===\nThe parish priest/pastor may be assisted by one or more other priests:\n\n<blockquote>Whenever it is necessary or opportune for the due pastoral care of the parish, one or more assistant priests can be joined with the parish priest. As cooperators with the parish priest and sharers in his concern, they are, by common counsel and effort with the parish priest and under his authority, to labour in the pastoral ministry\n:\u2014canon 545 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, assisted by the Canon Law Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Canadian Canon Law Society</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Whenever it is necessary or opportune in order to carry out the pastoral care of a parish fittingly, one or more parochial vicars can be associated with the pastor. As co-workers with the pastor and sharers in his solicitude, they are to offer service in the pastoral ministry by common counsel and effort with the pastor and under his authority\n:\u2014canon 545 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' in the English translation by the Canon Law Society of America</blockquote>\n\n===Honorary titles===\nThe honorary title of ''[[monsignor]]'' is conferred by the Pope upon diocesan priests (not members of [[religious institute]]s) in the service of the [[Holy See]], and may be granted by him also to other diocesan priests at the request of the priest's bishop. The priest so honored is considered to be a member of the [[papal household]]. The title goes with any of the following three awards:\n\n* ''[[Chaplain of His Holiness]]'' (called ''Papal Chamberlain'' until a 1969 reform),<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church \u2013 Guide]</ref> the lowest level, distinguished by purple buttons and trim on the black [[cassock]], with a purple sash.\n* ''[[Honorary Prelate]]'' (until 1969 called ''Domestic Prelate''), the middle level, distinguished by red buttons and trim on the black cassock, with a purple sash, and by choir dress that includes a purple cassock.\n* ''[[Protonotary Apostolic]]'', the highest level, with the same dress as that of an Honorary Prelate, except that the non-obligatory purple silk cape known as a [[ferraiolo]] may be worn also.\n\nIn December 2013, [[Pope Francis]] decided to make future grants of the title of ''Monsignor'' to priests not in the service of the Holy See only in the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness and only to priests aged 65 or over.<ref>{{cite news| last = O'Connell | first = Gerard| title= Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65 |url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 | newspaper =Vatican Insider|date=4 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nUnder legislation of [[Pope Pius X]], [[vicar general|vicars general]] and [[vicar capitular|vicars capitular]] (the latter are now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries ''durante munere'', i.e., as long as they hold those offices, and so are entitled to be addressed as Monsignor,<ref>\"Pariter, qui vicarii generalis aut etiam capitularis munere fungitur, hoc munere dumtaxat perdurante, erit protonotarius titularis\" (Pope Pius X, ''Inter multiplices curas'', 62. 21 February 1905)</ref> as indicated also by the placing of the abbreviated title \"Mons\", before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]''. (Honorary titles such as that of \"Monsignor\" are not considered appropriate for [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]].)\n\nSome of the Eastern Catholic Churches of Syriac tradition use the title ''[[Chorbishop]]'', roughly equivalent to the Western title of ''Monsignor''. Other Eastern Catholic Churches bestow the honorific title of ''[[Archimandrite]]'' upon unmarried priests as a mark of respect or gratitude for their services. Married presbyters may be honored with the position of ''[[Archpriest]]'', which has two grades, the higher is \"Mitred Archpriest\" which permits the priest to wear a mitre.\n\nIn the Latin Church titles of [[Archpriest]] is sometimes attached to the pastor of a few number of historic churches including the major basilicas in Rome.  These archpriests are not presbyters, but bishops or cardinals.<ref>See [[Archpriest#Roman Catholicism]].</ref> Similarly, the title of [[Archdeacon]] is sometimes conferred on presbyters.\n\n==Diaconate==\n[[Deacons]] are ordained ministers of the Church who are co-workers with the bishop alongside presbyters, but are intended to focus on the ministries of direct service and outreach to the poor and needy, rather than pastoral leadership. They are usually related to a parish, where they have a liturgical function as the ordinary minister of the [[Gospel]] and the Prayers of the Faithful, They may preach [[homilies]], and in the [[Roman Rite]] may preside at non-Eucharistic liturgies such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, and adoration/benediction. In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], in the absence of a priest, deacons do not vest and may only lead services as a reader, never presiding at weddings or funerals.\n\nThe scriptural basis and description of the role and qualifications of the deacon can be found in Acts 6:1\u20139, and in 1 Timothy 3:1\u201313.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stbrendanchurch.org/deacon/scripture.html |title=The Deacon |publisher=St. Brendan Church |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThey may be seminarians preparing for ordination to the priesthood, \"transitional deacons\", or \"permanent deacons\" who do not intend to be ordained as priests. To be ordained deacons, the latter must be at least 25 years old, if unmarried; if married, a prospective deacon must be at least 35 years old and have the consent of his wife. In the Latin Church, married deacons are permanent deacons. In most diocese there is a cut-off age for being accepted into formation for the diaconate.\n\nThe passage from membership of the laity to that of the clergy occurs with ordination to the diaconate.<ref name=canon266>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PX.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 266]</ref> Previously, the [[Latin Church]] rule was that one became a cleric on receiving clerical [[tonsure]], which was followed by [[minor orders]] and by the [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]], which was reckoned as one of the [[major orders]]. By his [[motu proprio]] ''Ministeria quaedam'' of 15 August 1972, [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed: \"The orders hitherto called minor are henceforth to be spoken of as 'ministries'.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html ''Ministeria quaedam''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103110807/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html |date=2011-11-03 }}, II</ref> The same motu proprio also decreed that the [[Latin Church]] would no longer have the major order of subdiaconate, but it permitted any [[episcopal conference]] that so desired to apply the term \"subdeacon\" to those who hold the ministry (formerly called the minor order) of \"[[acolyte]]\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html ''Ministeria quaedam''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103110807/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html |date=2011-11-03 }}, IV</ref> Even in those societies within the Latin Church that, with the approval of the Holy See, continue to administer the rites of tonsure, minor orders and subdiaconate, those who receive those rites remain lay people, becoming clerics only on being ordained as deacons.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html Instruction on the Application of the Apostolic Letter ''Summorum Pontificum''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223094426/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html |date=2016-02-23 }}, 30</ref>\n\n==Laity==\nMost of the people of God are the [[Laity#Roman Catholicism|laity]], a term derived from Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u1f78\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 (''Laos Theou''), meaning \"people of God\".
