The city has the largest port in the country, [[Port of Karachi]], followed by the second largest, [[Port Qasim]]. Karachi has also been ruled under a number of tribes which meant the city is home to a number of cultural sites including, [[Mohatta Palace]], [[National Museum of Pakistan]], [[Empress Market]], [[Frere Hall]], [[Jehangir Kothari Parade]], [[Karachi Municipal Corporation Building]] and the [[Hindu Gymkhana, Karachi|Hindu Gymkhana]]. There are also several beaches within the city, some of the most famous are [[Clifton Beach, Karachi|Clifton Beach]], [[French Beach, Karachi|French Beach]], [[Sandspit Beach]] and [[Manora Island]].\n\nThe province also forms the basin for the [[Indus river]]. This has led to a number of lakes being formed in the province. Some of the most notable ones include: [[Keenjhar Lake]], [[Manchar (lake)|Manchar Lake]] and the Bakri Waro Lake in [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Khairpur]]. The [[Kirthar National Park]] is also a protected reserve for several wildlife species within the region. The [[Thar Desert]] is also located in the province which adjoins it to [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and India. The [[Great Rann of Kutch]] is a protected wetland site in the province. There are two wildlife sanctuaries in the province: [[Rann of Kutch Wildlife Sanctuary]] and the [[Nara Desert Wildlife Sanctuary]]. The [[Sukkur Barrage]] is another famous icon in the province it was built to alleviate [[Famine|famines]] caused by lack of rain.\n\n[[Port Grand Food and Entertainment Complex]] is a recreational area built in the centre of [[Karachi]], Pakistan along the waterfront of the 19th-century [[Native Jetty Bridge]] that connects the [[Karachi Port Trust]] to [[Keamari]]. The complex is expected to attract up to 5,000 visitors a day and is a major hub of shopping, dining, cultural and coastal recreational activities in the city. Port Grand is located on Napier Mole Bridge a site that is very significant to the history of Karachi and has played a crucial role in making it the city it is today. The project stretches along 1,000&nbsp;ft of Karachi's ancient 19th-century Native Jetty Bridge and spreads over an area of 200,000 sq. ft. The one-kilometre bridge has been transformed into an entertainment and food enclave housing numerous eateries totalling 40,000 sq. ft of climate-controlled area and space for kiosks of exotic Pakistani and foreign food and a variety of beverages. To get to the Port Grand from anywhere in the city, Port Grand is a straight shot west out of Mai Kolachi, adjacent to the PNSC Building as the road curves into the facility on the right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/177989/good-times-port-grand-finally-makes-a-grand-opening/|title=Good times: Port Grand finally makes a grand opening \u2013 The Express Tribune|date=29 May 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Azad Jammu and Kashmir ===\n{{main|Tourism in Azad Kashmir}}\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"px\">\nFile:Kel Taobut Road Neelum Valley AJK.JPG|[[Taobat]], [[Neelum Valley]]\nFile:Saral Lake proper.jpg|[[Saral Lake]], [[Neelum Valley]]\nFile:View From Sharda Fort, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan.jpg| A View of [[Sharda, Azad Kashmir]]\nFile:Ganga Choti.jpg|[[Ganga Choti]], [[Bagh District|Bagh]]\n</gallery>[[Azad Kashmir]] is the region of Pakistan situated in Northern part of the country.

With more and more foreign investment and funding, Pakistan was able to build its major road and air networks to cater to mass movements of cargo and inter-city travel. Roads are being developed by several consultants from the [[Northern Areas]] all the way down to the [[Port of Karachi]].\n\nStatistics from the last decade show tourism is a \"market led industry and not supply driven\" which has led to a large decline in travel to Pakistan. This has led to fewer tour agencies being set up and development of historical sites. It has been estimated that the public and private sectors have gradually earned less income from the tourism market causing less investment and innovation within the industry. This has led to several sites to depreciate over time and the lack of minimum international standards have left many sites in poor states. The latest budget showed that less money was being spent on research and marketing and more on defence and other fixed markets.\n\nThe 2017 World Economic forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report (TTCR) ranked Pakistan 125th out of 136 countries.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2017/country-profiles/#economy=PAK|title=Country profiles|publisher=}}</ref> Low branding and marketing effectiveness and low priority the government gave to the travel and tourism industry.\n\n===[[Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation]]===\nSome have encouraged the government to again attract tourists to Pakistan by initiating the sponsorship of new businesses in the tourist market: building and maintaining the road and air networks to meet international standards. The maturation of human and natural resources can also contribute to the development of this feeble industry. Advertising campaigns need to attract tourist by developing holiday packages tailored to explore the greater regions of the country.\n\nIn September 2004 with the bifurcation of the Minorities, Culture, Sports,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crimaz.org |title=Wrestling |publisher=John Douglas}}</ref> Tourism and Youth Affairs, tourism was given a separate status of [[Ministry of Tourism (Pakistan)|Ministry of Tourism]].

Some of these include:\n* [[Altit Fort]] in [[Hunza Valley]]\n* [[Bagrot Valley]]\n* [[Bala Hissar, Peshawar|Bala Hissar Fort]] in [[Peshawar]]\n* [[Chaqchan Mosque]] in [[Khaplu]]\n* [[Frere Hall]] in [[Karachi]]\n* [[Khaplu Palace]] in [[Khaplu]]\n* [[Mahabat Khan Mosque]]-A [[Mughal Era]] mosque in Peshawar\n* [[Clock Tower, Faisalabad|Faisalabad Clock Tower]] and the Eight Bazaars\n* 17th- and 18th-century [[Tombs of Talpur Mirs]]\n* [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Faiz Mahal]] of the Talpur Mirs\n* [[Samadhi of Ranjit Singh]]\n* Mughal built the tomb of [[Abul-Hasan ibn Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Asaf Khan]] at [[Shahdara Bagh]]\n* [[Empress Market]] built during the rule of the [[British Empire]]\n* The tomb of [[Qutb-ud-din Aibak]], the first Sultan of Delhi and founder of the slave dynasty\n* [[Mohatta Palace]], built in 1927\n* 18th-century [[Omar Hayat Mahal]]\n* 19th-century Italian chateau [[Noor Mahal|Noor Palace]]\n* The 3000 BC fort of [[Kot Diji]] and [[Faiz Mahal]] in [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Khairpur]]\n* 16th-century fort at [[Skardu Fort|Skardu]]\n* Nagar Fort at Chitral\n\nPost-independence Pakistan retained its heritage by constructing sites to commemorate its independence by blending styles and influences from the past. Some of these include:\n* [[Minar-e-Pakistan]] in Lahore\n* [[Grand Jamia Mosque, Lahore]]\n* [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]]\n* The [[Mazar-e-Quaid|mausoleum]] of the founder of Pakistan, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]\n* [[Bab-e-Pakistan]] a memorial site for the victims of the [[Partition of India|independence]]\n* [[Pakistan Monument]] in Islamabad\n* The [[Tomb of Muhammad Iqbal|mausoleum]] of [[Allama Muhammad Iqbal]]\n* The [[Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar|Shrine]] of [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]] - [[Sufi]] Saint in [[Sindh]]\n* [[Gorakh Hill]], [[Dadu District|Dadu]] \u2013 situated on one of the highest plateaus of Sindh\n\n==Infrastructure and the economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Pakistan|Transport in Pakistan|Telecommunications in Pakistan}}\nTourism is a growing industry in Pakistan. With more and more foreign investment and funding, Pakistan was able to build its major road and air networks to cater to mass movements of cargo and inter-city travel. Roads are being developed by several consultants from the [[Northern Areas]] all the way down to the [[Port of Karachi]].\n\nStatistics from the last decade show tourism is a \"market led industry and not supply driven\" which has led to a large decline in travel to Pakistan. This has led to fewer tour agencies being set up and development of historical sites. It has been estimated that the public and private sectors have gradually earned less income from the tourism market causing less investment and innovation within the industry. This has led to several sites to depreciate over time and the lack of minimum international standards have left many sites in poor states. The latest budget showed that less money was being spent on research and marketing and more on defence and other fixed markets.\n\nThe 2017 World Economic forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report (TTCR) ranked Pakistan 125th out of 136 countries.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2017/country-profiles/#economy=PAK|title=Country profiles|publisher=}}</ref> Low branding and marketing effectiveness and low priority the government gave to the travel and tourism industry.\n\n===[[Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation]]===\nSome have encouraged the government to again attract tourists to Pakistan by initiating the sponsorship of new businesses in the tourist market: building and maintaining the road and air networks to meet international standards. The maturation of human and natural resources can also contribute to the development of this feeble industry. Advertising campaigns need to attract tourist by developing holiday packages tailored to explore the greater regions of the country.\n\nIn September 2004 with the bifurcation of the Minorities, Culture, Sports,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crimaz.org |title=Wrestling |publisher=John Douglas}}</ref> Tourism and Youth Affairs, tourism was given a separate status of [[Ministry of Tourism (Pakistan)|Ministry of Tourism]]. The Ministry of Tourism was responsible for the policy formulation, development, marketing and promotion of foreign and domestic tourism besides coordination and regulating of federal and provincial governments and private sector activities responsible and involved in tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prr.hec.gov.pk/Chapters/7S-5.pdf |title=Analysis Tourism Management In Pakistan |accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Golden Peak & Sillhoutte of 3 South Koreans.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[South Korea]]n tourists at the Golden Peak in [[Hunza\u2013Nagar District]], [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]]]\nHowever, it was not able to achieve any of its objectives and was abolished under Constitutional requirements in Pakistan on June 30, 2011. The promotions of tourism were transferred to the provinces. Now each province runs its own organization that is responsible for tourism. It is now part of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation or [[PTDC]]. It is now responsible for the development of the tourism sector.\n\n* [[Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab]] (TDCP) is working in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] for the promotion of the tourism sector.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab (TDCP) |url=https://www.tdcp.gop.pk/ |website=tdcp.gop.pk |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Sindh Tourism Development Corporation]] (STDC)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sindh Tourism Development Corporation (STDC) |url=https://stdc.gos.pk/ |website=stdc.gos.pk |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref> and Culture, Tourism and Antiquities Department<ref>{{cite web |title=Culture, Tourism and Antiquities Department |url=http://sindhculture.gov.pk/ |website=sindhculture.gov.pk |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref> -
