He was a [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force) of [[Nazi Germany]], and the fourth recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]], the nation's highest military decoration at the time.{{refn|In 1940, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves was second only to the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}), which was awarded only to senior commanders for winning a major battle or campaign, in the military order of the Third Reich. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves as highest military order was surpassed on 28 September 1941 by the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ({{Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}).{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=3, 7.}}|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nBorn in [[Mannheim]], Wick joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and was trained as a fighter pilot. He was assigned to [[Jagdgeschwader 2]] \"Richthofen\" (JG&nbsp;2\u20142nd Fighter Wing), and saw combat in the [[Battle of France|Battles of France]] and [[Battle of Britain|Britain]]. In October 1940, he was given the position of wing commander of JG&nbsp;2\u2014the youngest in the Luftwaffe to hold this position. Wick was shot down in the vicinity of the [[Isle of Wight]] on 28 November 1940, most likely by the British ace [[John Dundas (RAF officer)|John Dundas]], who was himself shot down by Wick's wingman. Wick was posted as [[missing in action]], presumed dead. By then he had been credited with the destruction of 56 enemy aircraft in aerial combat, making him the leading German ace at the time. Flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], he claimed all of his victories against the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].\n\n==Early life and pre-war service==\nHelmut Paul Emil Wick was born on 5 August 1915 in [[Mannheim]], Germany, the youngest of three children of a civil engineer, Karl Wick and Berta Wick, n\u00e9e Schenck. Helmut's eldest brother Walter was born in [[Swakopmund]], at the time in the German protectorate in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]]. After the outbreak of World War I, the family returned to Germany.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=10}} Owing to the demand for his father's skills and expertise building roads and bridges, Helmut spent most of his childhood traveling throughout the German Empire. The Wick family moved to [[Hanover]] in 1919; Helmut's mother died there in February 1922. His father then took the family to Oliva, near [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in East Prussia, finally settling in [[Berlin]] in 1935.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=11}}\n\nUpon graduating from ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' (secondary school) in 1935, Wick applied to the officer candidate course of the new German Air Force. Scoring well on the suitability tests, he was accepted into the German military on 6 April 1936 at the [[Luftwaffe]] officer candidate school in [[Dresden]], after completing compulsory [[Reich Labour Service]]. He swore the [[Hitler oath|oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler]] on 16 April. After passing officer training courses, Wick was assessed as \"well suited to become an officer\" on 13 July.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=12}} He then started flight training and shortly later soloed in a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]] \"Stieglitz\". Wick was considered an average pilot and had difficulties with his theoretical training, especially those topics that were of little or no interest to him. In early May 1937, he was briefly transferred to the 6. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (6th squadron) of [[Kampfgeschwader 254|''Kampfgeschwader'' 254]] (254th Bomber Wing). A month later he returned to Dresden to complete his officer training.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=14}}\n\nWick failed to pass the third course of his training but was given a second chance and on 1 April 1938 reported to the officer candidate school at the ''Luftkriegsschule 3'' (LKS&nbsp;3\u20143rd air war school), Wildpark-West near [[Werder (Havel)|Werder]]. He successfully completed the course and in mid-1938 started special pilot training at the Fighter Training facility at [[Werneuchen]]. Upon graduation, he was assigned to II.[[Group (military aviation unit)|Gruppe]] [[Jagdgeschwader 135|''Jagdgeschwader'' 135]] (135th Fighter Wing) which on 1 November 1938 became [[Jagdgeschwader 333|''Jagdgeschwader'' 333]] (333rd Fighter Wing) under ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel) [[Max Ibel]] at [[Herzogenaurach]], flying obsolete [[Arado Ar 68]] biplane fighters. On 8 November 1938, ''Oberf\u00e4hnrich'' (senior ensign) Wick was promoted to [[Leutnant]] (second lieutenant) and on 1 January 1939 was transferred to 1. ''Staffel'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 133|''Jagdgeschwader'' 133]] (133rd Fighter Wing), which was later renamed [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG&nbsp;53\u201453rd Fighter Wing).{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=16}}{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=69}} It was there that Wick began flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] monoplane fighter under the tutelage of [[Werner M\u00f6lders]], a [[Spanish Civil War]] [[flying ace]] credited with 14 aerial victories. Under M\u00f6lders' guidance, Wick became a ''Schwarmf\u00fchrer'' (flight leader).{{sfn|Spick|2011|p=73}}\n\n==World War II==\n===Phoney War and Battle of France===\nOn 31 August 1939 Wick was given orders to transfer to \"Jagdgeschwader Richthofen Nr. I\". At the time there was no such unit; the intention was to send him to [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (JG&nbsp;1\u22121st Fighter Wing), based in [[D\u00f6beritz]], near Berlin. During [[World War I]] the \"Richthofen Geschwader\" name had been attached to the World War I era [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]]. The \"Richthofen\" name had been incorrectly put on Wick's order. Wick noticed the mistake, realizing that he could now choose between JG&nbsp;1 or the famous [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] (JG&nbsp;2\u20142nd Fighter Wing) which currently bore the \"Richthofen\" name.{{sfn|Neher|1943|p=13}} He chose the Richthofen ''Geschwader'', commanded by ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) [[Gerd von Massow]], the unit was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E \"Emil\"|Bf 109 E-3]] and used the tactical code ''Yellow 3''. On 1 September, Wick joined its ''3. Staffel'', serving in the air defence of Berlin during the [[Polish September Campaign|Polish Campaign]]. Following the German victory in Poland, JG&nbsp;2 was transferred to [[Frankfurt]]-Rebstock and tasked with protection of Germany's Western border during the [[Phoney War]]\u2014the phase between Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, and the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=18}} Flying his sixth combat mission, Leutnant Wick claimed his first, and the ''Geschwader's'' second victory on 22 November 1939.{{refn|According to Ringlstetter the ''Geschwader's'' first victory was credited to ''Oberfeldwebel'' Erwin Kley, who received a gold watch and for this achievement.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=20}} Weal states that the first victory went to Wick.{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=26}}|group=\"Note\"}} Near [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], he shot down a French [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss Hawk 75]] fighter piloted by either Sergent Saillard or Camille Plubeau of the Groupe de Chasse II/4 [[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l\u2019Air]], who were killed.{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=116}} For this feat, Wick received the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class  ({{Lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse}}).{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=20}} Wick was allowed to take home leave from his ''Geschwader'' and spent Christmas with his wife Ursel, his baby son Walter, and his parents, before returning to his Gruppe at Frankfurt-Rebstock. From 10 to 17 February 1940, Wick and six other members from JG&nbsp;2 spent a week in the [[Black Forest]] on the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]], skiing and relaxing.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=21}}\n\nOn 10 May 1940, German forces launched an offensive in Western Europe, but Wick remained on the ground while his aircraft, Bf&nbsp;109 ''Yellow 2'', underwent an engine change. Seven days later, he was back in the air, recording three victories over French [[Lior\u00e9-et-Olivier|LeO 45]] bombers in one mission. By 6 June, Wick had 10 confirmed and two unconfirmed victories, including four French [[Bloch MB.150|Bloch 151/152]] fighters that he shot down on 5 June to record his fourth through seventh victories. The two unconfirmed victories were [[Royal Navy]] [[Fairey Swordfish]] biplane torpedo bombers claimed on 19 May and for which he had no witnesses.{{sfn|Musciano|1982|p=74}}{{sfn|Weal|2012|p=43}} The action of 5 June, according to Wick, occurred near [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]] from 17:17 to 17:30.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2001b|p=102}} The [[French Air Force]] made an effort to bomb the bridge heads on the Somme on the 5 June. 126 [[sortie]]s were flown. The 18 and 19 GBA (''Groupe de bombardement''\u2014Group of Bombardment) lost four [[Br\u00e9guet 693]] near P\u00e9ronne when they were attacked by German fighters while undertaking an attack on German tanks and lorries.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=68}} A second operation was carried out without loss to French bomber forces, but the escorting French fighter group GC I/4 lost one Curtis Hawk fighter.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=68}} The French fighter commands, ZOAN and ZOAE flew 438 combat missions submitting the loss of 15 fighters. At approximately 17:00, three [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]]s from GC I/2 and five from II/2 were ordered to attack German spearheads. Near [[Roye, Somme]], they were intercepted by 10 Bf 109s. Each side lost two aircraft. At the same time [[Dewoitine D.520]] from GC II/7 lost four in combat with Bf 109s over the Somme sector, although the fighters they were attacked by were probably from II./[[JG 53]].{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nThe next day Wick became the first pilot of the I. ''Gruppe'' to complete 100 combat missions, claiming his eighth and ninth victory the same day. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{Lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz 1. Klasse}}) by ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Harry von B\u00fclow-Bothkamp]]. By the end of the French Campaign, Wick's total stood at 14 confirmed victories, trailing only ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) M\u00f6lders of JG&nbsp;53 with 25 victories and ''Hauptmann'' [[Wilhelm Balthasar]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 27|''Jagdgeschwader'' 27]] (JG&nbsp;27\u201427th Fighter Wing) with 23 victories as the Luftwaffe{{'}}s top scorer.{{sfn|Musciano|1982|p=74}} At the end of the French campaign, 3.

The first combat took place when Wick dived on a formation of nine 607 squadron fighters. Flight Lieutenants Blackadder and Brazin, Pilot Officer David Evans and [[Sergeant]] Richard Spyer were shot down. All nine Hurricanes suffered damage. German pilots claimed 11.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|pp=248\u2013249}} Returning to base Wick claimed to have shot down three Spitfires over the Channel.

The next day G\u00f6ring revoked his decision and gave Wick command of JG&nbsp;2 \"Richthofen\". At 25 years of age, he thus became the youngest ''Major'' and ''Geschwaderkommodore'' in the Luftwaffe. ''Major'' [[Wolfgang Schellmann]], who had commanded JG 2 since the beginning of September 1940, was placed in command of JG&nbsp;27 instead of Wick.{{sfn|Musciano|1982|p=76}}{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=276}} Wick's wing was chosen to stage southward, to provide an aerial escort to Hitler on his personal train as it jounred to the French-Spanish border for the [[Meeting at Hendaye]] with [[Francisco Franco]].{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=66}}\n\nIn November 1940 Wick continued to claim steadily.

Spotting a flight of Spitfires he climbed to intercept from a more favourable attack position. In a diving attack Wick shot down and killed Pilot Officer Paul A. Baillon, of No.&nbsp;609 Squadron, flying Spitfire ''R6631''.{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=69}}\n\n{{Quote_box\n|width=32%\n|align=right\n|quote=Wick was a real daredevil, He had excellent eyesight and therefore was usually the first to see enemy aircraft.

Pflanz then shot down the Spitfire, which he observed to crash in the sea with its pilot still inside.{{sfn|Foreman|1988|p=143}} Pflanz later claimed Wick survived being shot down and watched him clamber into a dingy.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=276}}\n\nOnly later did Pflanz find out that it was Wick he saw bailing out. G\u00f6ring had ordered ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[torpedo boat]]s on a night-long search-and-rescue mission for Wick. The next day, other naval vessels and the ''[[Seenotdienst]]'' ([[air-sea rescue]]) service, escorted by fighters of JG&nbsp;2, continued in vain to search for him. It has been claimed the Germans used international airwaves to contact the RAF [[Air Ministry]] for information on Wick's fate.{{sfn|Collier|1980|pp=181, 261}}{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=70}} He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, in the daily ''Wehrmachtbericht''.{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=70}} Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=45}}{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=71}} The loss of the irreplaceable Wick had a detrimental effect on morale in JG&nbsp;2.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=276}}\n\n==Family==\nOn 5 August 1939, Wick married Ursel Rolfs (1916\u20131968) in Berlin. The marriage produced two children, Walter (born in October 1939) and a girl, Sabine, born after Wick's death, in February 1941.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=17}} On 23 January 1941, Wick's father received a telephone call from Bodenschatz at the [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] that Wick had been rescued and taken [[prisoner of war]]. Apparently an official [[Reuters]] report had indicated that a 25-year-old Luftwaffe ''Major'', credited with 56 aerial victories, had been interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Canada. Both Hitler and G\u00f6ring initiated steps to get confirmation of the report.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=140}} On 5 February 1941, a telegram from [[Ottawa]] informed Ursel that Wick was not interned in Canada. Ursel married the military doctor, ''Stabsarzt'' (equivalent to captain) Dr. Gerhard Tausch, later in the war.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=142}}\n\n==Summary of career==\n===Aerial victory claims===\nMatthews and Foreman, authors of ''Luftwaffe Aces \u2014 Biographies and Victory Claims'', researched the [[German Federal Archives]] and found records for 56 aerial victory claims, plus four further unconfirmed claims, all of which claimed on the Western Front.{{sfn|Matthews|Foreman|2015|pp=1412\u20131413}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders collapsible collapsed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align:right; width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" | Chronicle of aerial victories\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n{{legend2|#fbec5d;|This and the \u2660 ([[Ace of spades]]) indicates those aerial victories which made Wick an \"[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]\", a term which designates a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more airplanes in a single day. |border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br />\n{{legend2|#e3d9ff|This and the \u2013 (dash) indicates unconfirmed aerial victory claims for which Wick did not receive credit.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br />\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Claim\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | Claim\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" | \u2013 3.

He was a [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force) of [[Nazi Germany]], and the fourth recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]], the nation's highest military decoration at the time.{{refn|In 1940, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves was second only to the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}), which was awarded only to senior commanders for winning a major battle or campaign, in the military order of the Third Reich. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves as highest military order was surpassed on 28 September 1941 by the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ({{Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}).{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=3, 7.}}|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nBorn in [[Mannheim]], Wick joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and was trained as a fighter pilot. He was assigned to [[Jagdgeschwader 2]] \"Richthofen\" (JG&nbsp;2\u20142nd Fighter Wing), and saw combat in the [[Battle of France|Battles of France]] and [[Battle of Britain|Britain]]. In October 1940, he was given the position of wing commander of JG&nbsp;2\u2014the youngest in the Luftwaffe to hold this position. Wick was shot down in the vicinity of the [[Isle of Wight]] on 28 November 1940, most likely by the British ace [[John Dundas (RAF officer)|John Dundas]], who was himself shot down by Wick's wingman. Wick was posted as [[missing in action]], presumed dead. By then he had been credited with the destruction of 56 enemy aircraft in aerial combat, making him the leading German ace at the time. Flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], he claimed all of his victories against the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].\n\n==Early life and pre-war service==\nHelmut Paul Emil Wick was born on 5 August 1915 in [[Mannheim]], Germany, the youngest of three children of a civil engineer, Karl Wick and Berta Wick, n\u00e9e Schenck. Helmut's eldest brother Walter was born in [[Swakopmund]], at the time in the German protectorate in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]]. After the outbreak of World War I, the family returned to Germany.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=10}} Owing to the demand for his father's skills and expertise building roads and bridges, Helmut spent most of his childhood traveling throughout the German Empire. The Wick family moved to [[Hanover]] in 1919; Helmut's mother died there in February 1922. His father then took the family to Oliva, near [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in East Prussia, finally settling in [[Berlin]] in 1935.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=11}}\n\nUpon graduating from ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' (secondary school) in 1935, Wick applied to the officer candidate course of the new German Air Force. Scoring well on the suitability tests, he was accepted into the German military on 6 April 1936 at the [[Luftwaffe]] officer candidate school in [[Dresden]], after completing compulsory [[Reich Labour Service]]. He swore the [[Hitler oath|oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler]] on 16 April. After passing officer training courses, Wick was assessed as \"well suited to become an officer\" on 13 July.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=12}} He then started flight training and shortly later soloed in a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]] \"Stieglitz\". Wick was considered an average pilot and had difficulties with his theoretical training, especially those topics that were of little or no interest to him. In early May 1937, he was briefly transferred to the 6. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (6th squadron) of [[Kampfgeschwader 254|''Kampfgeschwader'' 254]] (254th Bomber Wing). A month later he returned to Dresden to complete his officer training.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=14}}\n\nWick failed to pass the third course of his training but was given a second chance and on 1 April 1938 reported to the officer candidate school at the ''Luftkriegsschule 3'' (LKS&nbsp;3\u20143rd air war school), Wildpark-West near [[Werder (Havel)|Werder]]. He successfully completed the course and in mid-1938 started special pilot training at the Fighter Training facility at [[Werneuchen]]. Upon graduation, he was assigned to II.[[Group (military aviation unit)|Gruppe]] [[Jagdgeschwader 135|''Jagdgeschwader'' 135]] (135th Fighter Wing) which on 1 November 1938 became [[Jagdgeschwader 333|''Jagdgeschwader'' 333]] (333rd Fighter Wing) under ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel) [[Max Ibel]] at [[Herzogenaurach]], flying obsolete [[Arado Ar 68]] biplane fighters. On 8 November 1938, ''Oberf\u00e4hnrich'' (senior ensign) Wick was promoted to [[Leutnant]] (second lieutenant) and on 1 January 1939 was transferred to 1.

During [[World War I]] the \"Richthofen Geschwader\" name had been attached to the World War I era [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]]. The \"Richthofen\" name had been incorrectly put on Wick's order. Wick noticed the mistake, realizing that he could now choose between JG&nbsp;1 or the famous [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] (JG&nbsp;2\u20142nd Fighter Wing) which currently bore the \"Richthofen\" name.{{sfn|Neher|1943|p=13}} He chose the Richthofen ''Geschwader'', commanded by ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) [[Gerd von Massow]], the unit was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E \"Emil\"|Bf 109 E-3]] and used the tactical code ''Yellow 3''. On 1 September, Wick joined its ''3. Staffel'', serving in the air defence of Berlin during the [[Polish September Campaign|Polish Campaign]]. Following the German victory in Poland, JG&nbsp;2 was transferred to [[Frankfurt]]-Rebstock and tasked with protection of Germany's Western border during the [[Phoney War]]\u2014the phase between Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, and the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=18}} Flying his sixth combat mission, Leutnant Wick claimed his first, and the ''Geschwader's'' second victory on 22 November 1939.{{refn|According to Ringlstetter the ''Geschwader's'' first victory was credited to ''Oberfeldwebel'' Erwin Kley, who received a gold watch and for this achievement.{{sfn|Ringlstetter|2005|p=20}} Weal states that the first victory went to Wick.{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=26}}|group=\"Note\"}} Near [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], he shot down a French [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss Hawk 75]] fighter piloted by either Sergent Saillard or Camille Plubeau of the Groupe de Chasse II/4 [[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l\u2019Air]], who were killed.{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=116}} For this feat, Wick received the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class  ({{Lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz 2.

Each side lost two aircraft. At the same time [[Dewoitine D.520]] from GC II/7 lost four in combat with Bf 109s over the Somme sector, although the fighters they were attacked by were probably from II./[[JG 53]].{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nThe next day Wick became the first pilot of the I.
