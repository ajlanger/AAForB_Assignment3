Although Pages was highly regarded for its well-crafted pop and jazz-fusion sound, the group did not achieve commercial success, and disbanded after recording three [[studio album]]s. Pages is perhaps best known as the launching pad for the recording careers of Page and George, who later formed the band [[Mr. Mister]], who topped the charts during the mid-1980s with pop classics such as \"[[Broken Wings (Mr. Mister song)|Broken Wings]]\" and \"[[Kyrie (song)|Kyrie]]\".\n\n==Origins==\nPages grew out of a long friendship between Richard Page and Steve George, dating back to their high school days in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. After high school, the two occasionally played together in bands in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. For a time, Page relocated to San Diego to attend music school.\n\nIn 1977, emerging teen idol [[Andy Gibb]], recently relocated in Los Angeles and as his first single, \"[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]],\" was racing to the top of the charts, recruited Page and George to perform vocals and keyboards as part of his backing band along with Peter Leinheiser on lead guitar, Jerry Manfredi on bass and Russ Battelene on drums.\n\nGibb toured with this group of musicians throughout 1977.  Toward the end of the year, the group recorded a demo tape of original jazz-fusion material.  This tape came to the attention of former [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] drummer [[Bobby Colomby]], who liked what he heard and signed the group, now called \"Pages,\" to [[Epic Records]].  The group also included Page's cousin John Lang.  Although Lang could not play a musical instrument (he claimed he was tone deaf), he became Pages' chief lyricist.\n\n==''Pages'' (1978)==\nPages' [[eponym]]ous first album, released in 1978, featured tracks ranging from light funk (\"Clearly Kim\"), calypso (\"Love Dance\") and driving rock (\"Room At The Top\") to smooth, harmonious ballads (\"This Is For The Girls,\" \"I Get It From You\") and luscious instrumentals (\"Interlude\").\n\nThe album featured an impressive array of session musicians.  The roster of talent included Colomby, [[Philip Bailey]] ([[Earth, Wind & Fire]]), [[Steve Forman]], [[Dave Grusin]], [Claudio Slon]], [[Victor Feldman]] and [[Michael Brecker]].  Although Page provided most of the lead vocals, George took the lead on \"Let It Go\" and \"Listen For The Love.\"\n\nColomby was quoted as saying that \"Pages represents the mainstream of contemporary music. They utilize various elements and combine them into an original and tasty mixture that will appeal to all formats of radio.\"  Despite Colomby's prediction, radio found it hard to place the group's sound.  Neither ''Pages'' nor its single \"If I Saw You Again\" made the Billboard charts.  Leinheiser and Battelene went their own way after the album was recorded.\n\n==''Future Street'' (1979)==\nAfter the commercial failure of their debut album, Pages went back to the studio to record their 1979 follow-up, entitled ''Future Street''.  [[Charles Foster Johnson|Charles \"Icarus\" Johnson]] joined on acoustic and electric guitar, and George Lawrence was brought in on drums.\n\nAccording to Page, \"Jerry [Manfredi], Steve [George] and myself were writing all the music but it just didn't sound right. Everybody knew it, but it was left unspoken for a long time because of that lingering bond. With Charles and George everything went perfect for the first time. The potential was just staring us in the face\".\n\nOnce again produced by Colomby, the album blended the finely crafted overtones of the first album with a somewhat hard-edged pop-rock sound with progressive overtones.  Additional musicians and artists on ''Future Street'' included [[Kenny Loggins]] (backing vocals and songwriting on \"Who's Right Who's Wrong\"), [[George Hawkins (musician)|George Hawkins]], [[Joey Trujillo]] and [[Jai Winding]]. George took lead vocals on \"Two People.\" Another detail is that the cover sleeve was designed by John Lang.\n\nThe opening track, the energetic \"I Do Believe In You,\" peaked at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1979.\n\n==''Pages'' (1981)==\nAlthough ''Future Street'' displayed future commercial potential, the album failed to chart.  Now down to a duo of Page and George (with long-time collaborator Lang still aboard as non-performing lyricist) the band switched to [[Capitol Records]], and brought in acclaimed producer [[Jay Graydon]].  The resulting album - eponymous like their first album - was released in 1981.  Two singles were released from the album, \"You Need a Hero\" and \"Come on Home.\"  These were the only tracks produced by Bobby Colomby on the album.\n\nThe players on this album consisted of Page (lead and background vocals, grand piano on the final track), George (backing vocals, Fender Rhodes, synthesizer: Yamaha CS-80 - Oberheim - ARP 2600, Mini-Moog, clavinet, electric power oboe and grand piano), John Lang (co-writer), [[Charles Foster Johnson|Charles Johnson]] (guitar), [[Neil Stubenhaus]] (bass), [[Ralph Humphrey]] (drums), [[Steve Khan]] (electric guitar), [[Jeff Porcaro]] (drums), [[Steve Lukather]] (electric guitar), [[Paulinho DaCosta]] (percussion), [[Vince Colaiuta]] (drums), [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] (sax), [[Jay Graydon]] (guitars, synthesizer programming, producer), [[Mike Baird (musician)|Mike Baird]] (drums) and [[Al Jarreau]] (vocal flute).  Despite this powerhouse lineup of musicians, the album failed to chart.\n\n==After Pages==\nWith the commercial failure of yet a third album, Page and George decided to disband the group, returning to the session circuit as highly sought-after songwriters and backing vocalists.\n\nThey recorded with well-known producers like [[David Foster]] and [[Quincy Jones]].  They performed on albums by [[Al Jarreau]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Pointer Sisters]], [[Molly Hatchet]] and [[Twisted Sister]]. Richard and Steve also did the vocals for [[Village People]], together with [[Chicago (band)|Chicago's]] [[Bill Champlin]] and Tom Kelly (songwriter of Madonna's world hit \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\").  Page was also part of the well-known back-up vocal trio of that also included Kelly and [[Tommy Funderburk]].\n\nBy 1982, Page and George decided to form a more pop-oriented band with permanent members.  As one-half of the four-piece band [[Mr. Mister]], they would achieve commercial success with the Number One singles \"Broken Wings\" and \"Kyrie\" in the mid-1980s.\n\n==Covers of Pages songs==\nA number of artists have covered Pages songs: \n\n[[Kenny Loggins]] covered \"Who's Right, Who's Wrong\" on his 1979 album ''[[Keep The Fire]]'', with [[Michael Jackson]] providing backing vocals. [[Four Tops|The Four Tops]] also covered the song on their 1981 Casablanca album \"Tonight!\"  \n\n[[America (band)|America]] recorded \"I Do Believe In You\" on their 1980 album, ''[[Alibi (America album)|Alibi]]''. <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMZjLSgQxhM I Do Believe In You by America-Topic on YouTube]</ref>  [[Frank Stallone]] also covered that song on his self-titled debut album from 1984.\n\n[[Herb Alpert]] recorded \"I Get It From You\" on his 1981 album, ''Magic Man''. <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzpq9Q7ZbO4 I Get It From You by Herb Alpert-Topic on YouTube]</ref>  In 1979, [[Bobby Hutcherson]] covered \"The Sailor's Song\" as a [[vibraphone]]-driven instrumental on his ''[[Un Poco Loco (album)|Un Poco Loco]]'' album. <ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/un-poco-loco-mw0000602898 Un Poco Loco-Bobby Hutcherson|AllMusic]</ref>\n\nIn 2011, multi-instrumentalist Zo!
