One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke.

The university was moved from Mondov\u00ec, where it had retreated during the French occupation.

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy.

A diploma of Emperor Henry III of 1047 attributes them to Bishop Regimir in the mid-ninth century.<ref>Savio, p. 320. Semeria, pp. 406-407. Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor). In addition there were five officials called ''Trinitatis''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1021.</ref> The earliest known Provost was Walpert in 890.<ref>Bosio, p. 1775, who labels Walpert a 'diacono cardinale'.</ref> The earliest known Archdeacon was Ansprand, who signed a document in 863.<ref>Bosio, p. 1784.</ref> The earliest known Archpriest was Erchempert, ''Sanctae Taurinensis Ecclesiae Archipresbyter Cardinalis''.<ref>Bosio, p. 1800.</ref> The earliest known Primicerius (Cantor) was Adalwert, who signed a document in 890 ''Sancte Taurinensis Ecclesie Diaconus Cardinalis Cantor.''<ref>Bosio, p. 1805.</ref> The Provost and Primicerius subscribe a document of Bishop Milo in 1185.<ref>Chiuso, p. 435.</ref> The office of Treasurer was established by a bull of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] of 15 January 1472.<ref>Bosio, p. 1794.</ref> In 1690, there were twenty-nine Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 370 note 1.</ref> In 1744, there were six dignities and twenty Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 395 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Cathedral Chapter, there were seven Collegiate Churches in the diocese, which had Chapters of Canons. At Carmagnola there was a Chapter of an Archpriest and nine Canons. At Chieri, at S. Maria della Scala there were an Archpriest, a Cantor, and ten canons. In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].

On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83.

On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from the metropolitan obedience of Milan, and created Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism.

A diploma of Emperor Henry III of 1047 attributes them to Bishop Regimir in the mid-ninth century.<ref>Savio, p. 320. Semeria, pp. 406-407. Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor). In addition there were five officials called ''Trinitatis''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1021.</ref> The earliest known Provost was Walpert in 890.<ref>Bosio, p. 1775, who labels Walpert a 'diacono cardinale'.</ref> The earliest known Archdeacon was Ansprand, who signed a document in 863.<ref>Bosio, p. 1784.</ref> The earliest known Archpriest was Erchempert, ''Sanctae Taurinensis Ecclesiae Archipresbyter Cardinalis''.<ref>Bosio, p. 1800.</ref> The earliest known Primicerius (Cantor) was Adalwert, who signed a document in 890 ''Sancte Taurinensis Ecclesie Diaconus Cardinalis Cantor.''<ref>Bosio, p. 1805.</ref> The Provost and Primicerius subscribe a document of Bishop Milo in 1185.<ref>Chiuso, p. 435.</ref> The office of Treasurer was established by a bull of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] of 15 January 1472.<ref>Bosio, p. 1794.</ref> In 1690, there were twenty-nine Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 370 note 1.</ref> In 1744, there were six dignities and twenty Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 395 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Cathedral Chapter, there were seven Collegiate Churches in the diocese, which had Chapters of Canons. At Carmagnola there was a Chapter of an Archpriest and nine Canons. At Chieri, at S. Maria della Scala there were an Archpriest, a Cantor, and ten canons. In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].
