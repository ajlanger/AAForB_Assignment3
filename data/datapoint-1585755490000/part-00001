[[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], an Ottawa war leader, began urging the Indian tribes that had been allied to the French during the French and Indian War to join together to continue the fight to remove the British from the territory. Pontiac initiated attacks on the western-most frontier forts and settlements, believin defeated French would rally and come to their aid. The start of the conflict is usually described as the siege of [[Fort Detroit]] on 10 May 1763. [[Fort Sandusky]], [[Fort Michilimackinac]], [[Fort Presque Isle]], and numerous other frontier outposts were quickly overrun.\n\nSeveral frontier forts in the [[Ohio Country]] had fallen to the allied tribes, and [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Ligionier]], and [[Fort Bedford]] along Forbes's road were besieged or threatened. Bouquet, who was in [[Philadelphia]], threw together a hastily organised force of 500 men, mostly Scots Highlanders, to relieve the forts. On 5 August 1763, Bouquet and the relief column were attacked by warriors from the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribes near a small outpost called [[Battle of Bushy Run|Bushy Run]], in what is now [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]]. In a two-day battle, Bouquet defeated the tribes and Fort Pitt was relieved. The battle marked a turning point in the war.\n\nIt was during Pontiac's War that Bouquet gained a certain lasting infamy. In a series of letters during the summer of 1763 between Bouquet and his commander, General [[Jeffery Amherst]], the idea was proposed and agreed upon to infect the Indians near Fort Pitt with [[smallpox]] by giving them infected blankets from the fort's smallpox hospital. Amherst wrote to Bouquet, then in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], on about 29 June 1763: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among those disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\"<ref>''The Conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian War after the Conquest of Canada'', Francis Parkman, 1886 - Vol. II, p. 39 (6th edition)</ref> Bouquet agreed, replying to Amherst on 13 July: \"I will try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself.\"<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_40_305_fn.jpeg Postscript of Bouquet's letter to Amherst, 13 July 1763]</ref> Amherst responded on 16 July: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.\"<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jpeg Amherst's reply to Bouquet, 16 July 1763]</ref>\n\nThe journal of William Trent, the commander of the militia at the fort, has provided additional evidence that this plan was carried out, though it appears that the plan had already been carried out before Amherst had proposed it to Bouquet.:\n<blockquote>''[June] 24th [1763] The Turtles Heart a principal Warrior of the Delawares and Mamaltee a Chief came within a small distance of the Fort Mr. McKee went out to them and they made a Speech letting us know that all our [POSTS] as Ligonier was destroyed, that great numbers of Indians [were coming and] that out of regard to us, they had prevailed on 6 Nations [not to] attack us but give us time to go down the Country and they desired we would set of immediately.

What is known is that an outbreak of smallpox did occur among the Indians of the area.  Since the smallpox incident at Fort Pitt, it is estimated that 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans - men, women, and children - died during and years after the Pontiac's War, mostly from smallpox given by the British and some in the outside infected areas than in combat.

This placed him in the heart of tribal lands and would allow him to quickly strike the natives' villages if they refused to cooperate. As part of the peace treaty, Bouquet demanded the return of all white captives in exchange for a promise not to destroy the Indian villages or seize any of their land. The return of the captives caused much bitterness among the tribesmen, because many of them had been forcibly adopted into Indian families as small children, and living among the Native Americans had been the only life they remembered.

The collapsing bubble generates an imploding shock wave that compresses and heats the gas at the center of the bubble to extremely high temperature.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1989 an experimental advance was introduced which produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In single-bubble sonoluminescence, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the [[standing wave]]. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon, because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt [[steel]], as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about 12,000 [[kelvin]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ndiaye AA, Pflieger R, Siboulet B, Molina J, Dufr\u00eache JF, Nikitenko SI | title = Nonequilibrium vibrational excitation of OH radicals generated during multibubble cavitation in water | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A | volume = 116 | issue = 20 | pages = 4860\u20137 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22559729 | doi = 10.1021/jp301989b | bibcode = 2012JPCA..116.4860N }}</ref> Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner [[temperature]] of such a bubble well above one million [[kelvin]]s was postulated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=William C.|last2=Clarke|first2=Douglas B.|last3=White|first3=John W.|last4=Young|first4=David A.|date=September 1994|title=Hydrodynamic simulations of bubble collapse and picosecond sonoluminescence|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2979\u20132985|doi=10.1063/1.868124|issn=1070-6631|bibcode=1994PhFl....6.2979M}}</ref> This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments indicate temperatures around {{convert|20000|K|C F}}.<ref name=Illinois/>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:Sonoluminescence.jpg|right|thumb|Long exposure image of multi-bubble sonoluminescence created by a high-intensity [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] horn immersed in a beaker of liquid]]\n\nSonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.\n\nSome facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1\u2013{{val|10|ul=mW}}.\n* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light\u2014about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter\u2014depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).\n* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability|Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilities]].\n* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.\n\nSpectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.<ref name=flannigan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Didenko YT, McNamara WB, Suslick KS | title = Effect of noble gases on sonoluminescence temperatures during multibubble cavitation | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 777\u201380 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11017370 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.777 | bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84..777D }}</ref> Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.\n\nA study describes a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

Here, ''\u03bc'' is the [[viscosity]], ''p'' the [[pressure]], and ''\u03b3'' the [[surface tension]]. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse. Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble.<ref name=\"pmid10046927\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barber BP, Putterman SJ | title = Light scattering measurements of the repetitive supersonic implosion of a sonoluminescing bubble | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 69 | issue = 26 | pages = 3839\u20133842 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 10046927 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.3839 | bibcode = 1992PhRvL..69.3839B }}</ref> Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh\u2013Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce.\n\n==Mechanism of phenomenon==\n{{main|Mechanism of sonoluminescence}}\nThe mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown.

Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner MP, Hilgenfeldt S, Lohse D | title = Single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | date = May 2002 | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 425\u2013484 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.425 | url = https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/single-bubble-sonoluminescence(ef18245b-e923-4f90-a6be-7b1189c34232).html | bibcode = 2002RvMP...74..425B }}</ref> An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20\u201340% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of [[water vapor]]. Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matula TJ, Crum LA | title = Evidence for gas exchange in single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = January 1998 | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 865\u2013868 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.865 | bibcode = 1998PhRvL..80..865M }}</ref> The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the [[argon flash]] devices.\n\nDuring bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).\n\nComputations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.\n\nAny discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Young JB, Schmiedel T, Kang W | title = Sonoluminescence in high magnetic fields. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = December 1996 | volume = 77 | issue = 23 | pages = 4816\u20134819 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.4816 | pmid = 10062638 | bibcode = 1996PhRvL..77.4816Y }}</ref>\n\n===Other proposals===\n\n====Quantum explanations====\nAn unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist [[Julian Schwinger]]<ref>{{cite web | first = Julian | last = Schwinger | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue1/colfusthe.html |title= Cold Fusion: A History of Mine |publisher=Infinite-energy.com |date=1989-03-23 |access-date=2012-11-14}}</ref> and more thoroughly considered in a paper by [[Claudia Eberlein]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eberlein C | title = Theory of quantum radiation observed as sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review A | date = April 1996 | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 2772\u20132787 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.53.2772| pmid = 9913192 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27f5/25c6fca3f8eff0605a6f71c75ce2a677ce7e.pdf | bibcode = 1996PhRvA..53.2772E | arxiv = quant-ph/9506024 }}</ref> of the [[University of Sussex]].

The collapsing bubble generates an imploding shock wave that compresses and heats the gas at the center of the bubble to extremely high temperature.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1989 an experimental advance was introduced which produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In single-bubble sonoluminescence, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the [[standing wave]]. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon, because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt [[steel]], as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about 12,000 [[kelvin]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ndiaye AA, Pflieger R, Siboulet B, Molina J, Dufr\u00eache JF, Nikitenko SI | title = Nonequilibrium vibrational excitation of OH radicals generated during multibubble cavitation in water | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A | volume = 116 | issue = 20 | pages = 4860\u20137 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22559729 | doi = 10.1021/jp301989b | bibcode = 2012JPCA..116.4860N }}</ref> Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner [[temperature]] of such a bubble well above one million [[kelvin]]s was postulated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=William C.|last2=Clarke|first2=Douglas B.|last3=White|first3=John W.|last4=Young|first4=David A.|date=September 1994|title=Hydrodynamic simulations of bubble collapse and picosecond sonoluminescence|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2979\u20132985|doi=10.1063/1.868124|issn=1070-6631|bibcode=1994PhFl....6.2979M}}</ref> This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments indicate temperatures around {{convert|20000|K|C F}}.<ref name=Illinois/>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:Sonoluminescence.jpg|right|thumb|Long exposure image of multi-bubble sonoluminescence created by a high-intensity [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] horn immersed in a beaker of liquid]]\n\nSonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.\n\nSome facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1\u2013{{val|10|ul=mW}}.\n* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light\u2014about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter\u2014depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).\n* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability|Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilities]].\n* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.\n\nSpectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.<ref name=flannigan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Didenko YT, McNamara WB, Suslick KS | title = Effect of noble gases on sonoluminescence temperatures during multibubble cavitation | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 777\u201380 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11017370 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.777 | bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84..777D }}</ref> Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.\n\nA study describes a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

Here, ''\u03bc'' is the [[viscosity]], ''p'' the [[pressure]], and ''\u03b3'' the [[surface tension]]. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse. Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble.<ref name=\"pmid10046927\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barber BP, Putterman SJ | title = Light scattering measurements of the repetitive supersonic implosion of a sonoluminescing bubble | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 69 | issue = 26 | pages = 3839\u20133842 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 10046927 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.3839 | bibcode = 1992PhRvL..69.3839B }}</ref> Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh\u2013Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce.\n\n==Mechanism of phenomenon==\n{{main|Mechanism of sonoluminescence}}\nThe mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown.

Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner MP, Hilgenfeldt S, Lohse D | title = Single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | date = May 2002 | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 425\u2013484 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.425 | url = https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/single-bubble-sonoluminescence(ef18245b-e923-4f90-a6be-7b1189c34232).html | bibcode = 2002RvMP...74..425B }}</ref> An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20\u201340% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of [[water vapor]]. Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matula TJ, Crum LA | title = Evidence for gas exchange in single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = January 1998 | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 865\u2013868 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.865 | bibcode = 1998PhRvL..80..865M }}</ref> The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the [[argon flash]] devices.\n\nDuring bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).\n\nComputations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.\n\nAny discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Young JB, Schmiedel T, Kang W | title = Sonoluminescence in high magnetic fields. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = December 1996 | volume = 77 | issue = 23 | pages = 4816\u20134819 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.4816 | pmid = 10062638 | bibcode = 1996PhRvL..77.4816Y }}</ref>\n\n===Other proposals===\n\n====Quantum explanations====\nAn unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist [[Julian Schwinger]]<ref>{{cite web | first = Julian | last = Schwinger | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue1/colfusthe.html |title= Cold Fusion: A History of Mine |publisher=Infinite-energy.com |date=1989-03-23 |access-date=2012-11-14}}</ref> and more thoroughly considered in a paper by [[Claudia Eberlein]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eberlein C | title = Theory of quantum radiation observed as sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review A | date = April 1996 | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 2772\u20132787 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.53.2772| pmid = 9913192 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27f5/25c6fca3f8eff0605a6f71c75ce2a677ce7e.pdf | bibcode = 1996PhRvA..53.2772E | arxiv = quant-ph/9506024 }}</ref> of the [[University of Sussex]]. Eberlein's paper suggests that the light in sonoluminescence is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to [[Hawking radiation]], the radiation generated at the [[event horizon]] of [[black hole]]s. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains [[virtual particle]]s, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This is related to the [[Unruh effect]] or the [[Casimir effect]].
