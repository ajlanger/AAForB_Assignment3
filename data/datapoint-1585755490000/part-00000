The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>[http://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf]</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.

As a result, Britain (and Nova Scotia) continued to trade with both the [[Confederate States of America|South]] and the North. Nova Scotia's economy boomed during the Civil War.\n\n===Post-Confederation history===\nSoon after the American Civil War, Pro-Canadian Confederation [[List of premiers of Nova Scotia|premier]] [[Charles Tupper]] led Nova Scotia into the [[Canadian Confederation]] on 1 July 1867, along with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]]. The [[Anti-Confederation Party]] was led by [[Joseph Howe]]. Almost three months later, in the election of 18 September 1867, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, numerous businesses developed in Nova Scotia became of pan-Canadian and international importance: the [[Starr Manufacturing Company]] (first skate-manufacturer in Canada), the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]], [[Cunard Line]], [[Alexander Keith's Brewery]], [[Morse's Tea Company]] (first tea company in Canada), among others. \n[[File:Bluenose sailing 1921.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Bluenose]]'' in 1921. The racing ship became a provincial icon for Nova Scotia in the 1920s and 1930s.]]\nNova Scotia became a world leader in both building and owning wooden sailing ships in the second half of the 19th century. Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders [[Donald McKay]] and [[William Dawson Lawrence]]. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured when [[Joshua Slocum]] became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world (1895). International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the ''[[Bluenose]]'' schooner. Nova Scotia was also the birthplace and home of [[Samuel Cunard]], a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] shipping magnate (born at [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], Nova Scotia) who founded the [[Cunard Line]].\n\nIn 1937, [[Everett Farmer]] was the last person hanged (for murder) in Nova Scotia.<ref name=nscourts/>\n\n== Demography ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Nova Scotia}}\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nAccording to the 2006 Canadian census<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo26d-eng.htm |title= Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2006 Census) (Nova Scotia) | author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada|date=January 2005 | accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> the largest ethnic group in Nova Scotia is [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (31.9%), followed by English (31.8%), Irish (21.6%), French (17.9%), German (11.3%), [[First Nations|Aboriginal origin]] (5.3%), [[Dutch people|Dutch]] (4.1%), [[Black Nova Scotians|Black Canadians]] (2.8%), [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (1.9%) Italian (1.5%), and [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian]] (1.4%). 40.9% of respondents identified their ethnicity as \"Canadian\".\n\n=== Language ===\n{{See also|Maritimer English|Cape Breton English|Acadian French|Canadian Gaelic}}\nThe [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]] showed a population of 921,727.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>[http://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf]</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.
