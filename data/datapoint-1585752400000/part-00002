It was declared an independent Afrikaans-language university in 1950 and the name was changed to the University of the Orange Free State.  The university has two satellite campuses.

In 1906 the tertiary part of Grey College became known as the Grey University College (GUC), but shortly thereafter the school and college parted ways.  In 1910, the Parliament of the Orange River Colony passed legislation declaring the GUC an official educational institution in the fields of the Arts and Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufs.ac.za/content.php?cid=1&sid=1|title=History of the University|website=ufs.ac.za}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the medium of instruction was English, but later this changed to be bilingual and included [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

The University was declared a full-fledged, independent university in 1950, and the name was again changed to the University of the Orange Free State.\n\nIn 1993, it adopted a system of parallel-medium tuition.

However, Dutch was one of the subjects taught at the college from the very beginning. Language activists in favor of [[Afrikaans]] made it possible for the language to be accepted as one of the subjects at the college as a \"supplementary subject to Dutch\" in 1919 where Afrikaans became a popular subject. In 1950 the University of the Orange Free State (UOFS) was established and the official medium language was Afrikaans.[https://www.ufs.ac.za/afrikaans-and-dutch-german-and-french/afrikaans-and-dutch-german-and-french-home/general/history-of-the-department] The name of the University again changed in 2001 to the University of the Free State as it is known today.[https://www.ufs.ac.za/about-the-ufs/ufs-in-focus/brief-history] Although a bilingual language policy (Afrikaans & English) were introduced since 1993 it was formalized in 2003.
