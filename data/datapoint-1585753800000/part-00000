He graduated in 1937 with a First in Economics. Called up in 1940, he had the leftwing equivalent of a good war: \"I had several large-scale quarrels with authority, although I was a good and efficient soldier\". Against the party line, he refused to take a commission, but advanced rapidly from anti-aircraft gunner to gunnery sergeant-major instructor and [[regimental sergeant major]], engaged in political work wherever he went \u2013 especially, from 1943 to 1946, in India.<ref name=jisc/>\n\nWhilst in India, Saville met Nehru and leaders of the Muslim League and his friendship with Indian communist students in Britain, all from establishment families, opened most anti-imperial doors, reinforced his own firm, but no longer uncritical, convictions. (Unlike him, Constance had never accepted the Moscow-imposed party line of 1939\u201341, which followed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact). The cold war, particularly frozen during the years of the [[Korean War]] and [[McCarthyism]], made it easier to maintain them.\n\nHe soon became a pillar of the Communist Party Historians' Group (\"intellectually my lifeline\"), and also of the Hull Communist party and its associated organisations, while building a double expertise in 19th-century British economic history and labour history.\n\nHe was deeply involved in the crisis of the British Communist Party in 1956, following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]]. Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956, or, more exactly, the failure of the British CP leadership to recognise its significance, transformed the Historians' Group from loyalists into vocal critics. Saville's was the first voice raised at its meetings. Breaking his affiliation with the cluster of British Marxist historians known as the [[Communist Party Historians Group]], Saville emerged as one of the founders of the ''[[New Reasoner]]'', in partnership with another Yorkshire Communist historian, [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]], part of a group of dissident Marxists who condemned the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956.\n\nSaville became Professor of Economic History at [[University of Hull|Hull University]] in 1973, where he had taught since 1947. He was associated with the ''[[Socialist Register]]'' (editor with [[Ralph Miliband]]) and the multi-volume ''Dictionary of Labour Biography''; from 1972 onwards he was one of the editors of the ten-volume ''Dictionary''.\n\nHis acquaintances and co-thinkers included John Griffith, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Philip Larkin]], [[Doris Lessing]], Ralph Miliband, Sir John Pratt, [[Raphael Samuel]] and E.P. Thompson. Harry Newton, a left-wing student, had passed himself off as a family friend. His true identity, as a [[MI5]] agent planted at his home in Hull, was uncovered after his death.\n\nHe is commemorated with a green plaque on [[The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull]].\n\nHis beloved wife Constance died in 2007.
