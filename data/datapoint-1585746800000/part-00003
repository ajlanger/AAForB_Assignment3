While initially skeptical that the Veyron would ever be produced, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] later declared the Veyron \"the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime\", comparing it to [[Concorde]] and [[SS Great Britain|S.S. ''Great Britain'']]. He also pointed out that the actual production cost of a Bugatti Veyron car was {{GBP|5 million}}, but was sold to customers for just {{GBP|1 million}}. When asked why, he jokingly said that [[Volkswagen]] designed the car merely as a \"Technical Exercise\". [[James May]] described the Veyron as \"our Concorde moment.\" Clarkson test drove the Veyron from [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] in northern Italy to [[London]] in a race against May and [[Richard Hammond]] who made the journey in a [[Cessna 182]] aeroplane.\n\nA few episodes later, May drove the Veyron at the VW test track and took it to its top speed of {{convert|407.16|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. In series 10, Hammond raced the Veyron against the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and lost. He also raced the car in Series 13 against a [[McLaren F1]] driven by [[The Stig]] in a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) drag race in [[Abu Dhabi]]. The commentary focused on Bugatti's \"amazing technical achievement\" versus the \"non-gizmo\" racing purity of the F1. While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were travelling at approximately 200&nbsp;km/h, the Bugatti overtook its competitor from 200 to 300&nbsp;km/h and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron's [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control]] in order to make the race more interesting.\n\nThe Veyron also won the award for \"Car of the Decade\" in ''Top Gear'''s end of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented \"It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment\". When the standard version was tested in 2008, it did not reach the top of the lap time leader board, with a time of 1:18.3, which was speculated as being due to the car's considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. In 2010 the Super Sport version achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (dethroned the [[Gumpert Apollo|Gumpert Apollo S]], replaced by the [[Ariel Atom V8]] in 2011),<ref name = \"tgpower\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/powerlaps.shtml\n| title = Power Laps\n| work  = [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear UK]]\n| publisher = BBC\n| accessdate = 29 November 2011\n}}</ref> as well as being taken to a verified average top speed of {{convert|431|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} by Raphanel on the programme,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/bugatti/8063779/Bugatti-Veyron-16.4-Super-Sport-review.html|title=Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport review|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Paul|last=Hudson|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=1 November 2010|quote=The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport is officially the world\u2019s fastest production car, after reaching 431.072 km/h (267.856mph) at the VW group's Ehra-Lessien test track on 3 July.

Still, we could not let go of the idea of reaching the 400 km/h mark with this car as well.

While initially skeptical that the Veyron would ever be produced, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] later declared the Veyron \"the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime\", comparing it to [[Concorde]] and [[SS Great Britain|S.S. ''Great Britain'']]. He also pointed out that the actual production cost of a Bugatti Veyron car was {{GBP|5 million}}, but was sold to customers for just {{GBP|1 million}}. When asked why, he jokingly said that [[Volkswagen]] designed the car merely as a \"Technical Exercise\". [[James May]] described the Veyron as \"our Concorde moment.\" Clarkson test drove the Veyron from [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] in northern Italy to [[London]] in a race against May and [[Richard Hammond]] who made the journey in a [[Cessna 182]] aeroplane.\n\nA few episodes later, May drove the Veyron at the VW test track and took it to its top speed of {{convert|407.16|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. In series 10, Hammond raced the Veyron against the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and lost. He also raced the car in Series 13 against a [[McLaren F1]] driven by [[The Stig]] in a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) drag race in [[Abu Dhabi]]. The commentary focused on Bugatti's \"amazing technical achievement\" versus the \"non-gizmo\" racing purity of the F1. While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were travelling at approximately 200&nbsp;km/h, the Bugatti overtook its competitor from 200 to 300&nbsp;km/h and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron's [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control]] in order to make the race more interesting.\n\nThe Veyron also won the award for \"Car of the Decade\" in ''Top Gear'''s end of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented \"It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment\". When the standard version was tested in 2008, it did not reach the top of the lap time leader board, with a time of 1:18.3, which was speculated as being due to the car's considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. In 2010 the Super Sport version achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (dethroned the [[Gumpert Apollo|Gumpert Apollo S]], replaced by the [[Ariel Atom V8]] in 2011),<ref name = \"tgpower\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/powerlaps.shtml\n| title = Power Laps\n| work  = [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear UK]]\n| publisher = BBC\n| accessdate = 29 November 2011\n}}</ref> as well as being taken to a verified average top speed of {{convert|431|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} by Raphanel on the programme,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/bugatti/8063779/Bugatti-Veyron-16.4-Super-Sport-review.html|title=Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport review|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Paul|last=Hudson|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=1 November 2010|quote=The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport is officially the world\u2019s fastest production car, after reaching 431.072 km/h (267.856mph) at the VW group's Ehra-Lessien test track on 3 July.
