On the same morning as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], forces of the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked the British [[Crown colony]] of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. The attack was in violation of international law as Japan had not declared war against the [[British Empire]]. The Hong Kong garrison consisted of [[British Army during the Second World War|British]], [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian]] and [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Canadian]] units besides Chinese soldiers and conscripts from both within and outside Hong Kong.\n\nLocations which played an important role in setting the pace of military operations during December 1941 include [[Tai Po Road]], the [[Shing Mun Redoubt]] trench and tunnel complex in the [[Gin Drinkers' Line]], [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]], [[Ma Lau Tong]], [[Lye Moon Passage|Lyemun]] (also spelt as Lye Moon or [[Lei Yue Mun]]), [[North Point]], [[Aldrich Bay]] (Quarry Bay), [[Shau Kei Wan|Shaukiwan]], [[Sai Wan Ho|Saiwan Hill]], [[Wong Nai Chung Gap|Wong Nei Chong Gap]] (Wong Nai Chung Gap), [[Tai Tam Reservoirs|Tytam]] (Tai Tam Gap & Reservoirs), [[Shouson Hill]] and [[Stanley Fort]]. Coastal defence batteries including those at [[Stonecutters Island]], [[Pak Sha Wan]], [[Lyemun fort]], Saiwan, [[Mount Collinson]], [[Mount Parker, Hong Kong|Mount Parker]], Belchers, [[Mount Davis, Hong Kong|Mount Davis]], Jubilee Hill, Bokara, and Stanley provided artillery support for ground operations until they were put out of action or surrendered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

On 21 October 1938 the Japanese occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong was surrounded.{{sfn|Fung|2005|p=129}} British defence studies concluded that Hong Kong would be extremely hard to defend in the event of a Japanese attack, but in the mid-1930s work began on improvements to defences including along the [[Gin Drinkers' Line]]. By 1940, the British determined to reduce the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|Hong Kong Garrison]] to only a symbolic size. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British [[British Far East Command|Far East Command]] argued that limited reinforcements could allow the garrison to delay a Japanese attack, gaining time elsewhere.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}} [[Winston Churchill]] and the general staff named Hong Kong as an ''outpost'' and decided against sending more troops. In September 1941, they reversed their decision and argued that additional reinforcements would provide a military deterrent against the Japanese and reassure Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] that Britain was serious about defending the colony.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the same morning as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], forces of the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked the British [[Crown colony]] of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. The attack was in violation of international law as Japan had not declared war against the [[British Empire]]. The Hong Kong garrison consisted of [[British Army during the Second World War|British]], [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian]] and [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Canadian]] units besides Chinese soldiers and conscripts from both within and outside Hong Kong.\n\nLocations which played an important role in setting the pace of military operations during December 1941 include [[Tai Po Road]], the [[Shing Mun Redoubt]] trench and tunnel complex in the [[Gin Drinkers' Line]], [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]], [[Ma Lau Tong]], [[Lye Moon Passage|Lyemun]] (also spelt as Lye Moon or [[Lei Yue Mun]]), [[North Point]], [[Aldrich Bay]] (Quarry Bay), [[Shau Kei Wan|Shaukiwan]], [[Sai Wan Ho|Saiwan Hill]], [[Wong Nai Chung Gap|Wong Nei Chong Gap]] (Wong Nai Chung Gap), [[Tai Tam Reservoirs|Tytam]] (Tai Tam Gap & Reservoirs), [[Shouson Hill]] and [[Stanley Fort]]. Coastal defence batteries including those at [[Stonecutters Island]], [[Pak Sha Wan]], [[Lyemun fort]], Saiwan, [[Mount Collinson]], [[Mount Parker, Hong Kong|Mount Parker]], Belchers, [[Mount Davis, Hong Kong|Mount Davis]], Jubilee Hill, Bokara, and Stanley provided artillery support for ground operations until they were put out of action or surrendered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

On 21 October 1938 the Japanese occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong was surrounded.{{sfn|Fung|2005|p=129}} British defence studies concluded that Hong Kong would be extremely hard to defend in the event of a Japanese attack, but in the mid-1930s work began on improvements to defences including along the [[Gin Drinkers' Line]]. By 1940, the British determined to reduce the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|Hong Kong Garrison]] to only a symbolic size. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British [[British Far East Command|Far East Command]] argued that limited reinforcements could allow the garrison to delay a Japanese attack, gaining time elsewhere.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}} [[Winston Churchill]] and the general staff named Hong Kong as an ''outpost'' and decided against sending more troops. In September 1941, they reversed their decision and argued that additional reinforcements would provide a military deterrent against the Japanese and reassure Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] that Britain was serious about defending the colony.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Among the dead was Major Charles Sydney Clarke of [[China Command]] HQ, two men of the 12th and 20th Coastal Regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA), six men of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (RASC) and two of the [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps]] (RCASC), nineteen men of the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] (RAOC) and three of the [[Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps]] (RCOC) and fourteen men of the RASC Company of the HKVDC.\n\nThe Japanese also executed at least fourteen captives at [[Overbays]], men of the same units as at The Ridge but also including three Royal Rifles of Canada and an officer of the 1st Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]]. A further seven were killed at [[Eucliffe]] and another 36 known victims cannot be placed precisely at one of the three locations (Ridge, Overbays, Eucliffe). Ride, who was present at the surrender, stated later that he saw fifty bodies lying by the road, including six Middlesex men among them. These men may have been some of those attached to the Hong Kong Chinese Regiment. The [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] report also states that five men of the [[Royal Air Force]] went missing near The Ridge on 20 December, perhaps captured and killed.\n\n====Deepwater Bay Ride====\nSix men of the Middlesex were killed defending [[Pillbox (military)|PB]] 14 at [[Deepwater Bay Ride]] (Lyon Light). It is uncertain whether they were killed in action, or murdered after capture.\n\n====St Stephen's College====\n{{main|St. Stephen's College massacre}}\nThe massacre perpetrated at [[St. Stephen's College, Hong Kong|St Stephen's College]] is the least well known.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Only thirteen victims can be confirmed at the location but reports and estimates put the real number as high as 99. The names of all the reported victims may never be known. Between 75 and 150 bodies were cremated by the victors in the aftermath of the battle but this total includes the victims of the fighting around Stanley Fort, such as the men of 965 Defence Battery. Although it is the \"most infamous massacre\", it \"has been the hardest to match with records\". Three British and four Chinese nurses were said to have been raped and murdered and one Canadian, Captain Overton Stark Hickey of the RCASC, murdered trying to stop the rapes. Besides the raped nurses, the medical staff suffered two deaths, a doctor shot in the head whilst attempting escape and 25 orderlies of the [[Indian Hospital Corps]] (IHC) and St John Ambulance personnel.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} The 55 St John victims of the battle of Hong Kong are memorialised at the present headquarters in Hong Kong but since no dates are given on the memorial it is impossible to identify those killed at St Stephen's. Four Chinese servants and one civilian, Tam Cheung Huen, were killed. Tam is the only Chinese victim of this massacre known by name. Among the soldiers receiving treatment at the college, two riflemen were mutilated and murdered and a further 56 men were reportedly bayoneted in their beds. Some of these men may have been Royal Rifles whose deaths are incorrectly reported as occurring elsewhere on 26 December.\n\n====Maryknoll Mission====\nAt least eight men\u2014six of the Middlesex and two [[Royal Engineers]]\u2014were killed after capture at [[Maryknoll Mission]]. Four members of the 8th Coastal Regiment RA may have been killed here as well; estimates of the number of men murdered vary from 11 to 16.\n\n====Brick Hill====\nTwenty-six prisoners are believed to have been killed after the fighting for [[Brick Hill (Hong Kong)|Brick Hill]] but some of these may have died in the fight, including some of the seventeen men of the Heavy Anti-Aircraft, [[Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery]] (HKSRA) known to have died there. Most of the soldiers here murdered were Muslims, including one religious teacher.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Casualties===\n<!--[[File:Sai Wan War Cemetery 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sai Wan War Cemetery]]]]-->\nThe Japanese had at least 1,895 men killed of an estimated 6,000 casualties. Allied casualties were 1,111 men killed, 1,167 missing and 1,362 wounded.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=214}} Allied dead, including British, Canadian and Indian soldiers, were eventually interred at [[Sai Wan War Cemetery|Sai Wan Military Cemetery]] and the [[Stanley Military Cemetery]]. C Force casualties in the battle were 23 officers and 267 other ranks killed or died of wounds, including five officers and 16 other ranks of the brigade headquarters, seven officers and 123 men of the Royal Rifles and 11 officers and 128 men of the Winnipeg Grenadiers. C Force also had 28 officers and 465 men wounded. Some of the dead were murdered by Japanese soldiers during or after surrender. Japanese soldiers committed a number of atrocities on 19 December, when the aid post at the Salesian Mission near Sau Ki Wan was overrun.{{sfn|Stacey|1956|p=488}} A total of 1,528 soldiers, mainly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (predominantly Indians and Canadians), are either buried or commemorated there. There are also graves of other Allied combatants who died in the region during the war, including some Dutch sailors who were re-interred in Hong Kong after the war.\n\nThe nearby Sai Wan Battery, with buildings constructed as far back as 1890, housed the Depot and Record Office of the [[Hong Kong Military Service Corps]] for nearly four decades after the war. The barracks were handed over to the government in 1985 and were subsequently converted into [[Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village]].\n\nAt the end of February 1942, The Japanese government stated that numbers of [[prisoners of war]] in Hong Kong were: British 5,072, Canadian 1,689, Indian 3,829, others 357, a total of 10,947.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=L-VXAAAAYAAJ&q=%225072+Canadian+1689+Indian+3829+others+357%22&dq=%225072+Canadian+1689+Indian+3829+others+357%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5lKDT_v4Csyu8QP9uomTBg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ Official Report of the Debates of The House of Commons of The Dominion Of Canada (Volume 2) 1942 (page 1168)]</ref> They were sent to:\n* [[Sham Shui Po Barracks|Sham Shui Po POW Camp]]\n* [[Argyle Street Camp]] for officers\n* [[North Point Camp]] primarily for Canadians and Royal Navy\n* [[Ma Tau Chung]] Camp for Indian soldiers\n* [[Yokohama Camp]] in Japan\n* [[Fukuoka Camp]] in Japan\n* [[Osaka Camp]] in Japan\n\nOf the Canadians captured during the battle, 267 subsequently perished in Japanese prisoner of war camps, mainly due to neglect and abuse. In December 2011, Toshiyuki Kato, Japan's parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs, apologised for the mistreatment to a group of Canadian veterans of the Battle of Hong Kong.{{sfn|AP|2011|p=2}}\n\nCivilians were interned at the [[Stanley Internment Camp]]. Initially, there were 2,400 internees although this number was reduced, by repatriations during the war. Interned persons who died and prisoners executed by the Japanese are buried in Stanley Military Cemetery.\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Hong Kong}}\n{{See also|British Army Aid Group|Hong Kong Volunteer Company}}\n\n[[File:Dongjianggu.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Dongjiang guerillas fighting in [[trench warfare|trenches]]}}]]\n[[Isogai Rensuke]] became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong. This ushered in the three years and eight months of Imperial Japanese administration. During the over three and a half years of occupation by the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=123}} The [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|local population in the rural New Territories]], a mix of Hakka, Cantonese and other Han Chinese groups, waged a guerrilla war with limited success. The [[Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong#Anti-Japanese resistance|resistance groups]] were known as the Gangjiu and Dongjiang forces. The Japanese razed several villages in reprisal; the guerillas fought until the end of the Japanese occupation. General Takashi Sakai, who led the invasion of Hong Kong and served as governor for some time, was tried as a war criminal and executed by a firing squad in 1946.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}\n\n===Awards===\n[[File:Hong Kong Park statue.jpg|thumb|150px|{{centre|Statue of an anonymous World War I soldier from statuary collection of [[Eu Tong Sen]].

The men had been captured and were in the process of planning a mass escape by British forces.

The shield in the colonial [[Emblem of Hong Kong]] granted in 1959, featured the battlement design to commemorate the defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War. This Coat of Arms was in place until 1997, when it was replaced by the regional emblem. After the war, Lei Yue Mun Fort became a training ground for the British Forces until 1987, when it was vacated. In view of its historical significance and unique architectural features, the former [[Urban Council]] decided in 1993 to conserve and develop the fort into the [[Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence]].\n\n[[File:HK Edinburgh Place \u724c\u533e City Hall Memorial Garden and Shrine.JPG|upright|thumb|{{centre|Commemorative plaque at the entrance to ''Memorial Gardens'' at [[Hong Kong City Hall]]}}]]\nThe memorial garden at [[Hong Kong City Hall]] commemorates those who died in Hong Kong during World War II.\n[[File:The City Hall Memorial Garden Overview 2014.jpg|The memorial garden at Hong Kong City Hall|thumb]]\n[[File:The City Hall Memorial Garden Memorial Shrine 2012.jpg|Shrine to the war dead in the memorial garden at Hong Kong City Hall|thumb]]\n\n==Orders of battle==\n* '''{{army|Empire of Japan}}'''\n** [[Twenty-Third Army (Japan)]] (Lieutenant-General T.
