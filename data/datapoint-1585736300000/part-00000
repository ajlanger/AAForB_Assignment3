{"title_page": "1923 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1923 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 15th. The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team. Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8-7 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LX, Issue 18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>. City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984-86 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991-94, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997-99, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013-15.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14-3 in the final.\n\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20-20 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1923}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{end}}\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== First Grade Championship  ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8-7 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] received a bye in the semi-finals and met Athletic in the final who they defeated 5 points to 0.\n\nThe following weekend another seven-a-side tournament was held at [[Carlaw Park]] to raise money for the Takapuna Orphanage which was destroyed by fire. Unfortunately the weather was particularly bad in the morning which had an effect on the attendance with only 1,000 spectators. The teams were supposed to composed of senior players but in reality were largely made up of junior players.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Seven-a-side Carnival Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Labour Day Tournament/Richmond Wins Final\n| page =5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LX, Issue 18536\n| date = 1923-10-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19231022.2.23.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Richmond || 2 || Athletic B || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct || Athletic A || 5 || Marist Old Boys || 3 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct || Devonport || 10 || Ponsonby || 6 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Semi Final\n| 20 Oct || Athletic A || 6 || Devonport || 3 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Final\n| 20 Oct || Richmond || 5 || Athletic A || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Seven-a-side Tournament Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 27 Oct <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Mixed Programme/Devonport Wins Seven A Side\n| page =3\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 258\n| date = 1923-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19231029.2.16\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Devonport || 21 || Athletic || 3 || Carlaw Park||1,000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 27 Oct || Ponsonby || 9 || City || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Semi Final\n| 27 Oct || Devonport || 14 || Marist Old Boys || 8 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Final\n| 27 Oct || Devonport || WBD || Ponsonby || LBD || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Lower Grade Clubs ===\nThere were 6 lower grades in 1923, though the sixth grade was split into A and B divisions once again, and one of the grades was a cadets grade.\n\nGrades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold:\n*'''Second Grade''': Athletic, '''City''', Devonport, Ellerslie, Epsom, Ihumatao (misspelled as Ihumata in the newpapers), Kingsland, Mangere, Marist Old Boys, Newton, Otahuhu, Ponsonby, and Richmond\n*'''Third Grade''': City, Coromandel, Devonport, Ellerslie, Ihumatao, Kingsland, Manukau, Marist, Parnell, Point Chevalier, '''Ponsonby''', Richmond, and Victoria Cruising Club.\n*'''Fourth Grade''': Athletic, City, '''Devonport''', Ellerslie, Kingsland, Mangere, Manukau, Marist, Newton, Otahuhu, Parnell\n*'''Fifth Grade''': City, Manukau, Marist, Newton, Northcote, Point Chevalier, '''Richmond''', and Takapuna\n*'''Sixth Grade A''': Athletic, City A, Devonport, Ellerslie, Manukau, Marist, Otahuhu, Parnell A, Parnell B, Ponsonby A,  Richmond\n*'''Sixth Grade B''': Athletics, City, Ellerslie, Manukau Cruising Club, Marist Parnell, Ponsonby, Richmond\n*'''Cadet Competition''': 22nd Company, 26th Company, 27th Company, 29th Company, 34th Company, 36th A Company, 36th B Company, 49th Company\n\n=== Exhibition Matches ===\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] traveled to [[Taumarunui]] towards the end of the season when they had a bye in the First Grade competition and were victorious against the local side by 14 points to 5.

Athletic won by 9 points to 5.\n\nOn the 15th of September the Athletic and Parnell 4th grade teams played a match in [[Whangarei]] which was the first time and organised game of rugby league had been played in the area.

They started the season with a match against Wellington in which they ran up a huge score, winning by 71 points to 12. Their second match was played mid week against Hamilton, before two games against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] and finishing the season with a game against an Auckland provincial team.\n\nAuckland challenged [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] for the Northern Union Cup which it had lost to the same opponents in 2022. The match was drawn and so [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] retained the cup. Auckland later played an Auckland provincial team and won comfortably in front of 7,000 spectators on [[Carlaw Park]]. A curtain-raiser was played between the Referees Association and the Junior Advisory Board, and was won by the former by 10 points to 6.

The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team. Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8-7 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LX, Issue 18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>. City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984-86 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991-94, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997-99, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013-15.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14-3 in the final.\n\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20-20 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1923}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{end}}\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== First Grade Championship  ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8-7 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] received a bye in the semi-finals and met Athletic in the final who they defeated 5 points to 0.\n\nThe following weekend another seven-a-side tournament was held at [[Carlaw Park]] to raise money for the Takapuna Orphanage which was destroyed by fire. Unfortunately the weather was particularly bad in the morning which had an effect on the attendance with only 1,000 spectators. The teams were supposed to composed of senior players but in reality were largely made up of junior players.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Seven-a-side Carnival Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Labour Day Tournament/Richmond Wins Final\n| page =5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LX, Issue 18536\n| date = 1923-10-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19231022.2.23.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Richmond || 2 || Athletic B || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct || Athletic A || 5 || Marist Old Boys || 3 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct || Devonport || 10 || Ponsonby || 6 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Semi Final\n| 20 Oct || Athletic A || 6 || Devonport || 3 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Final\n| 20 Oct || Richmond || 5 || Athletic A || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Seven-a-side Tournament Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 27 Oct <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Mixed Programme/Devonport Wins Seven A Side\n| page =3\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 258\n| date = 1923-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19231029.2.16\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Devonport || 21 || Athletic || 3 || Carlaw Park||1,000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 27 Oct || Ponsonby || 9 || City || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Semi Final\n| 27 Oct || Devonport || 14 || Marist Old Boys || 8 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Final\n| 27 Oct || Devonport || WBD || Ponsonby || LBD || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Lower Grade Clubs ===\nThere were 6 lower grades in 1923, though the sixth grade was split into A and B divisions once again, and one of the grades was a cadets grade.\n\nGrades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold:\n*'''Second Grade''': Athletic, '''City''', Devonport, Ellerslie, Epsom, Ihumatao (misspelled as Ihumata in the newpapers), Kingsland, Mangere, Marist Old Boys, Newton, Otahuhu, Ponsonby, and Richmond\n*'''Third Grade''': City, Coromandel, Devonport, Ellerslie, Ihumatao, Kingsland, Manukau, Marist, Parnell, Point Chevalier, '''Ponsonby''', Richmond, and Victoria Cruising Club.\n*'''Fourth Grade''': Athletic, City, '''Devonport''', Ellerslie, Kingsland, Mangere, Manukau, Marist, Newton, Otahuhu, Parnell\n*'''Fifth Grade''': City, Manukau, Marist, Newton, Northcote, Point Chevalier, '''Richmond''', and Takapuna\n*'''Sixth Grade A''': Athletic, City A, Devonport, Ellerslie, Manukau, Marist, Otahuhu, Parnell A, Parnell B, Ponsonby A,  Richmond\n*'''Sixth Grade B''': Athletics, City, Ellerslie, Manukau Cruising Club, Marist Parnell, Ponsonby, Richmond\n*'''Cadet Competition''': 22nd Company, 26th Company, 27th Company, 29th Company, 34th Company, 36th A Company, 36th B Company, 49th Company\n\n=== Exhibition Matches ===\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] traveled to [[Taumarunui]] towards the end of the season when they had a bye in the First Grade competition and were victorious against the local side by 14 points to 5. In Round 12 Athletic played a match against representatives of the Wednesday league which was a mid week league competition in Auckland as a curtain-raiser to the [[City Rovers|City]] \u2013 [[Marist Saints|Marist]] game. Athletic won by 9 points to 5.\n\nOn the 15th of September the Athletic and Parnell 4th grade teams played a match in [[Whangarei]] which was the first time and organised game of rugby league had been played in the area. As both of the teams were composed of junior players, the game was not of a high standard and gained little interest.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | List of Exhibition Matches\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 28 July <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Richmond v Taumarunui\n| page =9\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 180\n| date = 1923-07-26\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230730.2.134\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n|| Taumarunui|| 5 || Richmond || 14 || Taumarunui\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 15 Sep <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland at Whangarei\n| page =10\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 222\n| date = 1923-09-17\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230917.2.138\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Athletic 4th Grade|| 11 || Parnell  4th Grade|| 9 || Kensington Park, Whangarei\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 22 Sep <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Ponsonby Defeats City/Win by Six Points to Three\n| page =9\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 228\n| date = 1923-09-24\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230924.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n|| Ponsonby|| 6 || City || 3 || Carlaw Park  ||7,000\n|-\n|}\n\n== Representative Season ==\nThe Auckland representative side played 5 matches. They started the season with a match against Wellington in which they ran up a huge score, winning by 71 points to 12. Their second match was played mid week against Hamilton, before two games against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] and finishing the season with a game against an Auckland provincial team.\n\nAuckland challenged [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] for the Northern Union Cup which it had lost to the same opponents in 2022. The match was drawn and so [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] retained the cup. Auckland later played an Auckland provincial team and won comfortably in front of 7,000 spectators on [[Carlaw Park]]. A curtain-raiser was played between the Referees Association and the Junior Advisory Board, and was won by the former by 10 points to 6. In the final full league fixture of the season [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] played [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] again and were this time victorious 25 to 11.\n\n===Auckland v Wellington===\nEvery single member of the Auckland team scored points aside from [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] which was ironic given that he was one of Auckland Rugby League's most prolific point scorers.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 22 August\n| time =3:00\n| home =Auckland\n| score =71-12\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland V Wellington\n| page =10\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 201\n| date = 1923-08-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230823.2.139\n| accessdate = 2020-03-21}}</ref>\n| away =Wellington\n| try1 =Godick 3, [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]] 4, [[Frank Delgrosso]] 2, [[Bert Laing]] 2, V Thomas, [[Wally Somers]], W Hanlon, [[Bill Stormont]], Harry Douglas, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 =Godick 2, [[Bert Laing]] 2, [[Wilson Hall (rugby league)|Wilson Hall]], [[Clarrie Polson]] 3, [[Wally Somers]], [[Nelson Bass]]\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =Hedges, Ryan\n| con2 = Whittington\n| pen2 =Whittington, Greer\n| stadium =Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance =5000\n| referee =Ripley\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Hamilton===\nIn the match with Hamilton which, was played midweek, there were no players from the Ponsonby United and City Rovers clubs available as they were playing the Roope Rooster final on the following Saturday.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 22-16\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland Defeats Hamilton/22 Points to 16 in Good Game\n| page = 4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LX, Issue 18503\n| date = 1923-09-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230913.2.11.1\n| accessdate = 2020-03-20}}</ref>\n| away = Hamilton\n| try1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2, [[Clarrie Polson]] 2, [[Nelson Bass]], Harry Douglas\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Clarrie Polson]]\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = McVeay 2, N Vernall, Paki\n| con2 = McVeay\n| pen2 = McVeay\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 2000\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n===South Auckland (Waikato) v Auckland (Northern Union Challenge Cup Match)===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 15 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = South Auckland (Waikato)\n| score = 20-20\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Cup\n| page =10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 222\n| date = 1923-09-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230917.2.138\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n| away = Auckland\n| try1 = Payne 2, Wilson, Stewart\n| con1 = J Dufty 2\n| pen1 = J Dufty\n| try2 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Hec Brisbane]], Stevens, Webb\n| con2 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2, [[Clarrie Polson]] 2\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Steele Park, Hamilton\n| attendance =\n| referee = T Hill\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Auckland Province===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 29 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 44-15\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Beats Province/In Match of Big Scoring\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIV, Issue 234\n| date = 1923-10-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19231001.2.134\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n| away = Auckland Province\n| try1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]], [[Ivan Littlewood]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Clarrie Polson]], Johnston, Stack, O\u2019Brien, [[Hec McDonald]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2, F Wilson 2, [[Clarrie Polson]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = Stewart, [[Wilson Hall (rugby league)|Wilson Hall]], McNeil\n| con2 = S Crewther\n| pen2 = J Dufty, S Crewther\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n===Auckland v South Auckland===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 13 October\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 35-11\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Close of the Season/Auckland 35; S.
