Banda Singh Bahadur first established a Sikh kingdom and then brought in the Land reforms in the form of breaking up large estates and distributing the land to peasants. He and his comrades were eventually defeated and executed, but he became an icon among the Sikhs.

According to Sainapti, while creating the Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh said that ''bhaddar'' is ''bharam'' (illusion), and not ''[[dharma|dharam]]''.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/>\n\nTensions developed between the Punjabi [[Khatri]] disciples of the Guru in Delhi, and members of the newly formed Khalsa. A prominent Khatri disciple was expelled from the place of worship (''dharmasala'') for refusing to join the Khalsa. Another disciple was expelled for eating with him, starting a chain of further expulsions.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/> The expelled disciples convened a community gathering, at which two wealthy Khatris demanded that the Khalsa produce a written order from the Guru that a new mandatory code of conduct had been promulgated. A Khatri family that refused to follow the ''bhaddar'' ritual was boycotted by the Khatri community.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/> The Khatri council ([[panchayat|panch]]) closed the bazaar to pressure the Khalsa. The Khalsa petitioned the state officials to intervene, who forced reopening of the shops. Later, peace was established between the two groups in a ''sangat'' (congregation). However, hostility between some Khatris and the Khalsa persisted in the later years.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/>\n\n==Contemporary status==\n[[File:Communal lunch in Keshgarh Sahib.jpg|thumb| Khalsa principles of [[Deg Tegh Fateh|Deg]] to cook food ([[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]]) in huge amount]]\n\nToday, the Khalsa is respected by the entire gamut of Sikhs; however, not all Sikhs are Amritdharis<ref name=\"Cynthia Mahmood Faith Baisakhi\"/> The issue of Khalsa code of conduct has led to several controversies.

Many Sikhs in Britain have insisted on their right of not conforming to the Khalsa norms while maintaining that they are truly Sikh. On the other hand, some of the Khalsa Sikhs think of the non-Khalsa Sikhs as having abandoned the Sikh faith altogether. A 3HO sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan.

This has been deemed necessary due to the rising persecution of the rulers. Before joining the Khalsa, most of the people were from professions like farming, pottery, masonry, carpenters, [[Labana]]s, etc.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh in Oct 1708 deputed his disciple [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] to lead the Khalsa in an uprising against the Mughals. Banda Singh Bahadur first established a Sikh kingdom and then brought in the Land reforms in the form of breaking up large estates and distributing the land to peasants. He and his comrades were eventually defeated and executed, but he became an icon among the Sikhs. After a long exile the Khalsa regrouped under [[Nawab Kapur Singh]], who gathered local Khalsa leaders and created ''[[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]]'', a coalition army. The Dal Khalsa fought against the Mughals and the Afghans, eventually resulting in the establishment of a number of small republics called [[misl]]s (autonomous confederacies) and later in the formation of the [[Sikh Empire]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Mughal empire and the later establishment of the Sikh Empire in Punjab, the Khalsa was converted into a strong, multireligious and multinational fighting force, modernized according to European principles: the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]] which had a huge role in the expansion of the empire. Led by generals like: [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] himself, [[Misr Diwan Chand]] and [[Hari Singh Nalwa]]. It successfully defeated all its adversaries, including the Afghan tribals and army, Hill Chiefs, [[Misl|Misldars,]] Chinese, Tibetan and [[Gurkha]]s. By the time of death of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] in 1839, the whole army of [[Sikh Empire]] was assessed at 120,000 men, with 250 artillery pieces.

According to Sainapti, while creating the Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh said that ''bhaddar'' is ''bharam'' (illusion), and not ''[[dharma|dharam]]''.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/>\n\nTensions developed between the Punjabi [[Khatri]] disciples of the Guru in Delhi, and members of the newly formed Khalsa. A prominent Khatri disciple was expelled from the place of worship (''dharmasala'') for refusing to join the Khalsa. Another disciple was expelled for eating with him, starting a chain of further expulsions.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/> The expelled disciples convened a community gathering, at which two wealthy Khatris demanded that the Khalsa produce a written order from the Guru that a new mandatory code of conduct had been promulgated. A Khatri family that refused to follow the ''bhaddar'' ritual was boycotted by the Khatri community.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/> The Khatri council ([[panchayat|panch]]) closed the bazaar to pressure the Khalsa. The Khalsa petitioned the state officials to intervene, who forced reopening of the shops. Later, peace was established between the two groups in a ''sangat'' (congregation). However, hostility between some Khatris and the Khalsa persisted in the later years.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/>\n\n==Contemporary status==\n[[File:Communal lunch in Keshgarh Sahib.jpg|thumb| Khalsa principles of [[Deg Tegh Fateh|Deg]] to cook food ([[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]]) in huge amount]]\n\nToday, the Khalsa is respected by the entire gamut of Sikhs; however, not all Sikhs are Amritdharis<ref name=\"Cynthia Mahmood Faith Baisakhi\"/> The issue of Khalsa code of conduct has led to several controversies. In the early 1950s, a serious split occurred in the [[Sikh diaspora|Canadian Sikh community]], when the [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]] elected a clean-shaven Sikh to serve on its management committee.<ref name=\" PRMagocsi Canada\">{{cite book|editor=Paul Robert Magocsi |title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples |origyear=1998 |year=1999 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0802029386 |oclc=56300149 |pages=1157}}</ref> Although most of the early Sikh immigrants to Canada were non-Khalsa, and a majority of the members of the society were clean-shaven non-Khalsa Sikhs, a faction objected to the election of a non-Khalsa to the management committee. The factions in Vancouver and [[Victoria, British Columbia]] broke away from the Khalsa Diwan Society and established their own gurdwara society called Akali Singh.<ref name=\"PRMagocsi Canada\"/>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there have been tensions between the Khalsa Sikhs and the non-Khalsa Sikhs. Many Sikhs in Britain have insisted on their right of not conforming to the Khalsa norms while maintaining that they are truly Sikh. On the other hand, some of the Khalsa Sikhs think of the non-Khalsa Sikhs as having abandoned the Sikh faith altogether. A 3HO sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Parsons\n| first = Gerald\n| title = The Growth of Religious Diversity: Britain from 1945\n| year = 1994\n| publisher = Routledge\n| isbn = 978-0415083263\n| oclc = 29957116\n| pages = 231\n}}</ref>\n\nEach year the Khalsa display their military skills around the world at a festival called [[Hola Mohalla]].
