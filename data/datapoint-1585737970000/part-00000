Stereotypes of [[East Asian people|East Asians]], like other ethnic stereotypes, are often portrayed in the mainstream media, cinema, music, television, literature, internet, and other forms of creative expression in American culture and society. These stereotypes have been largely and collectively internalized by society and have mainly negative repercussions for Americans of East Asian descent and East Asian immigrants in daily interactions, current events, and government legislation.<ref name=\"vanishing\"/><ref name=\"felicia\"/> Media portrayals of East Asians often reflect an [[Americentric]] perception rather than realistic and authentic depictions of true cultures, customs and behaviors.<ref name=\"vanishing\">{{Citation |last=Kashiwabara |first=Amy |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Amydoc.html |title=Vanishing Son: The Appearance, Disappearance, and Assimilation of the Asian-US Man in US Mainstream Media |publisher=UC Berkeley Media Resources Center}}</ref> In the past, East Asian Americans have experienced [[discrimination]] and have been victims of [[hate crime]]s related to their ethnic stereotypes, as it has been used to reinforce [[xenophobia|xenophobic sentiments]].<ref name=\"vanishing\"/><ref name=\"sfgate\"/>\n\n==Exclusion or hostility==\n===Yellow Peril===\n[[File:YellowTerror.jpg|thumb|1899 editorial cartoon with caption: \"The Yellow Terror in all his glory.\"]]\n{{Main|Yellow Peril}}\n\nThe term \"Yellow Peril\" refers to [[White American|white]] apprehension, peaking in the late 19th-century, that the European inhabitants of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]] would be displaced by a massive influx of East Asians; who would fill the nation with a foreign culture and speech incomprehensible to those already there and steal jobs away from the European inhabitants and that they would eventually take over and destroy their civilization, ways of life, culture and values. The term has also referred to the belief and fear that East Asian societies would invade and attack Western societies, wage war with them and lead to their eventual destruction, demise and eradication. During this time, numerous anti-Asian sentiments were expressed by politicians and writers, especially on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], with headlines like \"The 'Yellow Peril'\" (''Los Angeles Times'', 1886) and \"Conference Endorses Chinese Exclusion\" (''The New York Times'', 1905)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1905/12/09/archives/conference-indorses-chinese-exclusion-editor-poon-chu-says-china.html |title=Conference Indorses Chinese Exclusion; Editor Poon Chu Says China Will... \u2013 Article Preview \u2013 The |work=New York Times |date= December 9, 1905|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}</ref> and the later Japanese Exclusion Act.

The model minority construct is typically measured by level of educational attainment, representation in [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] [[professional]] and managerial occupations, and household income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmhc.utexas.edu/modelminority.html#what|title=Model Minority Stereotype|website=cmhc.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> Generalized statistics and positive socioeconomic indicators of East Asian Americans are often cited to back up model minority status such as above average educational attainment rates, high representation in professional and managerial occupations such as academia, medicine, investment banking, management consulting, high technology, and law), and a higher household income than other racial groups in the United States as well as other socioeconomic indicators such as low poverty rates, low crime rates, low illegitimacy rates, low rates of welfare dependency, and lower divorce rates and higher family stability. East Asians are most often perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. However, some East Asian Americans believe the model minority stereotype to be damaging and inaccurate, and are acting to dispel this stereotype.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/290/5494/1072 ASIAN-AMERICAN SCIENTISTS: Silent No Longer: 'Model Minority' Mobilizes \u2013 Lawler 290 (5494): 1072 \u2013 Science].</ref> Some have said that the model minority myth may perpetuate a denial of Asian Americans' racial reality, which happens to also be one of eight themes that emerged in a study of commonly experienced Asian American microaggressions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Many scholars, activists, and most major American news sources have started to oppose this stereotype, calling it a misconception that exaggerates the socioeconomic success of East Asian Americans.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stacey J.

Complaints are dismissed by American politicians and other government legislators with the claim that the racism that many East Asian Americans still face is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematically deceptive [[racial hierarchy]]. Believing that due to their socioeconomic success and that they possess so-called \"positive\" stereotypical traits, many ordinary Americans assume that East Asian Americans face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in American society at large, and that their community is thriving, having \"gained\" socioeconomic success through their own merit.<ref>{{citation|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 \u2013 Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|accessdate=February 24, 2013|date=July 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|accessdate=February 24, 2013|date=July 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Stereotypes in American fiction==\n[[Fu Manchu]] and [[Charlie Chan]] are two important and well-known fictional East Asian characters in America's cultural history.

In the films, the role of Charlie Chan has usually been played by white actors (namely [[Warner Oland]], [[Sidney Toler]], and [[Roland Winters]]).<ref name=\"imdb\">{{Citation|title=Internet Movie Database&nbsp;\u2014 list of Charlie Chan movies|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013184/ |publisher=IMDB}}</ref>\n\nIn stark contrast to the Chinese villain Fu Manchu, East Asian American protagonist Charlie Chan represents the American archetype of the \"good\" East Asian.<ref name=\"wu\"/> In ''The House Without a Key'', Earl Derr Biggers describes Charlie Chan in the following manner: \"He was very fat indeed, yet he walked with the light dainty step of a woman. His cheeks were chubby as a baby's, his skin ivory tinted, his black hair close-cropped, his amber eyes slanting.\"<ref name=\"key\">Earl Derr Biggers, ''The House Without a Key'' (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1925), p. 76.</ref> Charlie Chan speaks English with a heavy accent and flawed grammar, and is exaggeratedly polite and apologetic. After one particular racist affront by a Bostonian woman, Chan responds with exaggerated submission, \"Humbly asking pardon to mention it, I detect in your eyes slight flame of hostility. Quench it, if you will be so kind. Friendly co-operation are essential between us.\" Bowing deeply, he added, \"Wishing you good morning.\"<ref name=\"key\"/><!--{I recommend this section be deleted for not being up-to-date.

Many modern critics, particularly Asian-American critics, claim that Charlie Chan has none of the daring, assertive, or romantic traits generally attributed to white fictional detectives of the time,<ref>Kim (1982), 179.</ref> allowing \"white America ...

Even worse, these critics contend, is the common portrayal of the East Asian population as having yellow skin tones (which the critics reference as [[colorism]]). This colorist portrayal negatively contrasts \"colored\" Asian Americans with the European population of North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. East Asians are also stereotyped (or orientalized) as having straight dark (or shiny \"blue\") hair usually styled in a \"bowl cut\" (boys) or with straight overgrown bangs (girls). They are often homogenized as one indiscriminate monolithic conglomeration of cultures, languages, histories, and physiological and behavioral characteristics.

Even worse, these critics contend, is the common portrayal of the East Asian population as having yellow skin tones (which the critics reference as [[colorism]]). This colorist portrayal negatively contrasts \"colored\" Asian Americans with the European population of North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. East Asians are also stereotyped (or orientalized) as having straight dark (or shiny \"blue\") hair usually styled in a \"bowl cut\" (boys) or with straight overgrown bangs (girls). They are often homogenized as one indiscriminate monolithic conglomeration of cultures, languages, histories, and physiological and behavioral characteristics. Almost invariably it is assumed that a person of Asian descent has genetic origins in East Asian countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] or [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nn03oZbkt8C&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=asians+are+stereotyped+as+being+a+homogeneous+group#v=onepage&q=asians%20are%20stereotyped%20as%20being%20a%20homogeneous%20group&f=false |title=Body Politics of the Asian American Woman: From Orientalist Stereotype to the Hybrid Body |author=Jung Heum Whang |date=September 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2013|isbn=9780549173045 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZXtZ8lFepsC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=immigrant+acts+asian+american+homogeneous+group+lisa+lowe#v=onepage&q=immigrant%20acts%20asian%20american%20homogeneous%20group%20lisa%20lowe&f=false|title=Immigrant Acts: On Asian American Cultural Politics|author=Lisa Lowe|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1996|accessdate=June 26, 2013|isbn=0822318644}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a common assumption that people of Asian descent are all of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Taiwanese descent, in reality the term \"Asian American\" broadly refers to all people who descend from the Asian continental sub-regions of [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] as a whole.
