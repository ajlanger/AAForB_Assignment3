Cultivated Australian is spoken by [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and was spoken by [[Malcolm Fraser]].\n\n=== Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander English ===\n{{Main|Australian Aboriginal English}}\n\nAustralian Aboriginal English refers to a dialect of Australian English used by a large proportion of Indigenous Australians. It is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. The dialect is not to be confused with [[Australian Kriol language]], which is not mutually intelligible with Australian English but in fact a separate language spoken by over 30,000 people. On the [[Torres Strait Islands]], a distinctive dialect known as [[Torres Strait English]], the furthest extent of which is [[Torres Strait Creole]], is spoken.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/ethnocultural-voices |title=ethnocultural voices &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Ethnocultural varieties ===\n\nThe ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=Australian English &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=Australian English defined &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1960s, major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne received large numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and the Middle East (Italians, Greeks, Lebanese, Maltese, Croats, Jews etc.), the second generation of these immigrants can also have a distinct accent, in a similar situation as the east coast of the United States with descendants of European migrants having the \"Jersey accent\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Regional variation==\nAlthough relatively homogeneous, some regional variations in Australian English are notable. The dialects of English spoken in the eastern states, where the majority of the population lives, differ somewhat to that spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]] and [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]]. Another notable dialect is [[Torres Strait English]], spoken by the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands. Torres Strait English, as distinct from Torres Strait Creole, developed separately to, but has been significantly influenced by, General Australian English.\n\nThe regional varieties of English can be distinguished in terms of vocabulary and phonology. With each local dialect taking words from various sources such as British, Irish and American English as well as local [[Indigenous Australian languages|Aboriginal languages]], it is in vocabulary where regional varieties are most distinct from each other. Regional phonological features may be inherited due to differing settlement patterns or may have developed locally.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nRegional variation in Australia consists primarily of differences in vocabulary rather than tone or accent.\n\nThere are differences in the [[Australian English vocabulary#Beer glasses|names of beer glasses]] from one area to another. In the 2000s, however, the range of glass sizes in actual use has been greatly reduced. In [[New South Wales]], [[wikt:Appendix:Australian English terms for clothing#Swimwear|swimwear]] is known as ''swimmers'' or ''cossie'' and, in Queensland, it is ''togs''. In most other areas,<!--Victoria and South Australia according to \"Australian English\"--> the term ''bathers'' dominates. What is referred to by schoolchildren as a bag in most parts of Australia is known as a \"port\" by some Queenslanders. Further, the processed meat known as \"devon\" on the East Coast is known as \"polony\" on the West Coast, while in Central Australia (South Australia and the Northern Territory), the term \"fritz\" is used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany regional variations are due to Australians' passion for sport and the differences in non-linguistic traditions from one state to another: the word ''football'' refers to the most popular code of football in different States or regions, or even ethnic groups within them. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] start a game of [[Australian rules football]] with a ''ball up'', Western Australians with a ''bounce down''; [[New South Wales]] people and [[Queensland]]ers start a game of [[rugby league]] football or [[rugby union]] football with a ''kick off'', as do soccer players across Australia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFrom 2004, the national governing body for Association football, (the [[Football Federation Australia]]), has promoted the use of \"football\" in place of \"soccer\". Several media outlets have adopted this use,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foxsports.news.com.au/football/ |title=Foxsports |publisher=Foxsports.news.com.au |date=7 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/ |title=Sydney Morning Herald |newspaper=Smh.com.au |date=23 December 2012}}</ref> while others have stuck with \"soccer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/sport/ |title=Daily Telegraph |work=News.com.au }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer Herald Sun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185547/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ The Courier-Mail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185248/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |title=West Australian |publisher=Thewest.com.au |access-date=15 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619020913/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |archive-date=19 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ The Advertiser] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012719/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ |date=2 February 2007 }}</ref> However, use of [[football (word)|the word \"football\"]] to mean either [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on the major code of the state, remains the standard usage in Australia. In all places, the specific name or nickname of the code (\"soccer\", \"league\", \"union\" or \"Aussie rules\") can often be heard used for disambiguation.\n\nThe slang word ''footy'' has been traditionally associated with either Australian rules football (Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory) or rugby league football (New South Wales, Queensland). Prominent examples in popular culture are ''[[The Footy Show (disambiguation)|The Footy Show]]''s; also FootyTAB, a betting wing of the NSW [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]].\n\nFor many Australians, the verb ''barrack'' (or the accompanying noun form ''barracker''), is used to denote following a team or club. Barrack has its origins in British English, although in the UK it now usually means to jeer or denigrate an opposing team or players. The expression \"root (or rooting) for a team\", as used in the United States, is not generally used in Australia (''root'' is slang for [[sexual intercourse]] in Australia).<ref>[http://www.traveller.com.au/its-rooted-aussie-terms-that-foreigners-just-wont-get-38nlc \"It's rooted: Aussie terms that foreigners just won't get\"], Tim Richards, http://www.traveller.com.au</ref>\n\nThere are many regional variations for describing social classes or [[subculture]]s. A ''[[bogan]]'' is also referred to as a ''bevan'' in Queensland. These variations, however, have almost completely been replaced by the term ''bogan''.\n\nDistinctive grammatical patterns also exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh?'' and the position of the word ''but'' at the end of a sentence in Queensland (\"But I don't like him\" becomes \"I don't like him but\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Phonology===\n\n;Variation between {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}\nThere exists significant regional variation in terms of the extent to which the [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap.E2.80.93bath split|trap\u2013bath split]] has taken hold particularly before {{IPA|/nd/}} (especially the suffix ''-mand''), {{IPA|/ns/}}, {{IPA|/nt/}}, {{IPA|/nt\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/mpl/}}. In words like ''chance'', ''plant'', ''branch'', ''sample'' and ''demand'', the majority of Australians use {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} (as in ''bad''). Some, however, use {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (as in ''cart'') in these words, particularly in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. In parts of Victoria and South Australia, ''castle'' rhymes with ''hassle'' rather than ''parcel''. Also, some may use {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} in ''grasp'', ''gasp'', ''plaque'' and ''rasp''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Felicity Cox and Robert Mannell |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/transcription/exercises/index.html |title=Australian English Transcription Practice Exercises \u2013 Orthography |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> The table below, based on Crystal (1995), shows the percentage of speakers from different capital cities who pronounce words with {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} as opposed to {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Use of {{IPA|/'''\u0250\u02d0'''/}} as opposed to {{IPA|/'''\u00e6'''/}}\n|-\n!

Cultivated Australian is spoken by [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and was spoken by [[Malcolm Fraser]].\n\n=== Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander English ===\n{{Main|Australian Aboriginal English}}\n\nAustralian Aboriginal English refers to a dialect of Australian English used by a large proportion of Indigenous Australians. It is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. The dialect is not to be confused with [[Australian Kriol language]], which is not mutually intelligible with Australian English but in fact a separate language spoken by over 30,000 people. On the [[Torres Strait Islands]], a distinctive dialect known as [[Torres Strait English]], the furthest extent of which is [[Torres Strait Creole]], is spoken.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/ethnocultural-voices |title=ethnocultural voices &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Ethnocultural varieties ===\n\nThe ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=Australian English &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=Australian English defined &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1960s, major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne received large numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and the Middle East (Italians, Greeks, Lebanese, Maltese, Croats, Jews etc.), the second generation of these immigrants can also have a distinct accent, in a similar situation as the east coast of the United States with descendants of European migrants having the \"Jersey accent\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Regional variation==\nAlthough relatively homogeneous, some regional variations in Australian English are notable. The dialects of English spoken in the eastern states, where the majority of the population lives, differ somewhat to that spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]] and [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]]. Another notable dialect is [[Torres Strait English]], spoken by the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands. Torres Strait English, as distinct from Torres Strait Creole, developed separately to, but has been significantly influenced by, General Australian English.\n\nThe regional varieties of English can be distinguished in terms of vocabulary and phonology. With each local dialect taking words from various sources such as British, Irish and American English as well as local [[Indigenous Australian languages|Aboriginal languages]], it is in vocabulary where regional varieties are most distinct from each other. Regional phonological features may be inherited due to differing settlement patterns or may have developed locally.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nRegional variation in Australia consists primarily of differences in vocabulary rather than tone or accent.\n\nThere are differences in the [[Australian English vocabulary#Beer glasses|names of beer glasses]] from one area to another. In the 2000s, however, the range of glass sizes in actual use has been greatly reduced. In [[New South Wales]], [[wikt:Appendix:Australian English terms for clothing#Swimwear|swimwear]] is known as ''swimmers'' or ''cossie'' and, in Queensland, it is ''togs''. In most other areas,<!--Victoria and South Australia according to \"Australian English\"--> the term ''bathers'' dominates. What is referred to by schoolchildren as a bag in most parts of Australia is known as a \"port\" by some Queenslanders. Further, the processed meat known as \"devon\" on the East Coast is known as \"polony\" on the West Coast, while in Central Australia (South Australia and the Northern Territory), the term \"fritz\" is used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany regional variations are due to Australians' passion for sport and the differences in non-linguistic traditions from one state to another: the word ''football'' refers to the most popular code of football in different States or regions, or even ethnic groups within them. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] start a game of [[Australian rules football]] with a ''ball up'', Western Australians with a ''bounce down''; [[New South Wales]] people and [[Queensland]]ers start a game of [[rugby league]] football or [[rugby union]] football with a ''kick off'', as do soccer players across Australia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFrom 2004, the national governing body for Association football, (the [[Football Federation Australia]]), has promoted the use of \"football\" in place of \"soccer\". Several media outlets have adopted this use,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foxsports.news.com.au/football/ |title=Foxsports |publisher=Foxsports.news.com.au |date=7 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/ |title=Sydney Morning Herald |newspaper=Smh.com.au |date=23 December 2012}}</ref> while others have stuck with \"soccer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/sport/ |title=Daily Telegraph |work=News.com.au }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer Herald Sun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185547/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ The Courier-Mail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185248/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |title=West Australian |publisher=Thewest.com.au |access-date=15 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619020913/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |archive-date=19 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ The Advertiser] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012719/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ |date=2 February 2007 }}</ref> However, use of [[football (word)|the word \"football\"]] to mean either [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on the major code of the state, remains the standard usage in Australia. In all places, the specific name or nickname of the code (\"soccer\", \"league\", \"union\" or \"Aussie rules\") can often be heard used for disambiguation.\n\nThe slang word ''footy'' has been traditionally associated with either Australian rules football (Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory) or rugby league football (New South Wales, Queensland). Prominent examples in popular culture are ''[[The Footy Show (disambiguation)|The Footy Show]]''s; also FootyTAB, a betting wing of the NSW [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]].\n\nFor many Australians, the verb ''barrack'' (or the accompanying noun form ''barracker''), is used to denote following a team or club. Barrack has its origins in British English, although in the UK it now usually means to jeer or denigrate an opposing team or players. The expression \"root (or rooting) for a team\", as used in the United States, is not generally used in Australia (''root'' is slang for [[sexual intercourse]] in Australia).<ref>[http://www.traveller.com.au/its-rooted-aussie-terms-that-foreigners-just-wont-get-38nlc \"It's rooted: Aussie terms that foreigners just won't get\"], Tim Richards, http://www.traveller.com.au</ref>\n\nThere are many regional variations for describing social classes or [[subculture]]s. A ''[[bogan]]'' is also referred to as a ''bevan'' in Queensland. These variations, however, have almost completely been replaced by the term ''bogan''.\n\nDistinctive grammatical patterns also exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh?'' and the position of the word ''but'' at the end of a sentence in Queensland (\"But I don't like him\" becomes \"I don't like him but\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Phonology===\n\n;Variation between {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}\nThere exists significant regional variation in terms of the extent to which the [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap.E2.80.93bath split|trap\u2013bath split]] has taken hold particularly before {{IPA|/nd/}} (especially the suffix ''-mand''), {{IPA|/ns/}}, {{IPA|/nt/}}, {{IPA|/nt\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/mpl/}}. In words like ''chance'', ''plant'', ''branch'', ''sample'' and ''demand'', the majority of Australians use {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} (as in ''bad''). Some, however, use {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (as in ''cart'') in these words, particularly in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. In parts of Victoria and South Australia, ''castle'' rhymes with ''hassle'' rather than ''parcel''. Also, some may use {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} in ''grasp'', ''gasp'', ''plaque'' and ''rasp''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Felicity Cox and Robert Mannell |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/transcription/exercises/index.html |title=Australian English Transcription Practice Exercises \u2013 Orthography |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> The table below, based on Crystal (1995), shows the percentage of speakers from different capital cities who pronounce words with {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} as opposed to {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Use of {{IPA|/'''\u0250\u02d0'''/}} as opposed to {{IPA|/'''\u00e6'''/}}\n|-\n!
