This assessment was developed over the span of a decade by [[Dean Delis]], [[Edith Kaplan]], and Joel Kramer, and it was published in 2001. The D-KEFS comprises nine tests that were designed to stand alone. Therefore, there are no aggregate measures or composite scores for an examinee's performance. A vast majority of these tests are modified, pre-existing measures (e.g., the [[Trail Making Test]]); however, some of these measures are new indices of executive functions (e.g., Word Context Test).\n\n==Nine tests==\nThis measure consists of the following subtests:\n\n* The ''Trail Making Test'' measures flexibility of thinking on a visual-motor sequencing task\n* The ''Verbal Fluency Test'' measures letter fluency, category fluency, and category switching\n* The ''Design Fluency Test'' measures one's initiation of problem-solving behavior, fluency in generating visual patterns, creativity in drawing new designs, simultaneous processing in drawing the designs while observing the rules and restrictions of the task, and inhibiting previously drawn responses\n* The ''Color-Word Interference Test'' measures ability to inhibit a dominant and automatic verbal response\n* The ''Sorting Test'' measures concept-formation skills, modality-specific problem-solving skills (verbal/nonverbal), and the ability to explain sorting concepts abstractly\n* The ''Twenty Questions Test'' measures the ability to categorize, formulate abstract, yes/no questions, and incorporate the examiner's feedback to formulate more efficient yes/no questions\n* The ''Word Context Test'' measures verbal modality, deductive reasoning, integration of multiple bits of information, hypothesis testing, and flexibility of thinking\n* The ''Tower Test'' measures spatial planning, rule learning, inhibition of impulsive and perseverative responding, and the ability to establish and maintain instructional set\n* The ''Proverb Test'' measures one's ability to form novel, verbal abstractions\n\nThese 9 subtests generate 16 main achievement scores and hundreds of optional error, contrast, accuracy, and time-interval scores. As such, use of the computerized scoring assistant (available for purchase from the test publisher) makes scoring the measure less time consuming.\n\nThis assessment was normed with a representative sample.<ref name=\"Shunk A W, Davis A W, Dean R S 2006 275\u2013279\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shunk AW, Davis AW, Dean RS |title=.

D-KEFS is designed to be used in school settings by school psychologists, specifically it can be used as an important tool that complements traditional tests of intelligence and other basic achievement skills.
