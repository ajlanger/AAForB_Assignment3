It is one of the [[List of coastal weather stations in the British Isles|22 coastal weather stations]] whose reports are broadcast as part of the [[Shipping Forecast|BBC Shipping Forecast]]. Valentia Observatory is part of Met \u00c9ireann, the Irish Meteorological Service. The observatory was set up in August 1868. Valentia island is, on average, the wettest weather station in Ireland. The monthly averages for Sunshine and Rainfall are based on 2010 statistics which are around average apart from July, which received only 40% of its normal sunshine hours and 219% of its normal rainfall. Valentia island also has a station for [[Navtex]] transmissions. Valentia Island sits on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite it being on the same latitude as [[St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Anthony]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, it enjoys much milder winters thanks to the moderating effect of prevailing west or south west winds, and the effects of the warming Gulf Stream current. Snow and frost are rare, and because of this the island can support many sub-tropical varieties of plants.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Valentia Island, [[County Kerry]] (1981\u20132010, extremes

It is one of the [[List of coastal weather stations in the British Isles|22 coastal weather stations]] whose reports are broadcast as part of the [[Shipping Forecast|BBC Shipping Forecast]]. Valentia Observatory is part of Met \u00c9ireann, the Irish Meteorological Service. The observatory was set up in August 1868. Valentia island is, on average, the wettest weather station in Ireland. The monthly averages for Sunshine and Rainfall are based on 2010 statistics which are around average apart from July, which received only 40% of its normal sunshine hours and 219% of its normal rainfall. Valentia island also has a station for [[Navtex]] transmissions. Valentia Island sits on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite it being on the same latitude as [[St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Anthony]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, it enjoys much milder winters thanks to the moderating effect of prevailing west or south west winds, and the effects of the warming Gulf Stream current. Snow and frost are rare, and because of this the island can support many sub-tropical varieties of plants.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Valentia Island, [[County Kerry]] (1981\u20132010, extremes
