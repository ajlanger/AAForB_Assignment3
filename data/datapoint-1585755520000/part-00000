An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.<ref>Allen, E.

Some major events such as floods, earthquakes, and eruptions, do occur.  But these catastrophes are strictly local.  They neither occurred in the past, nor shall happen in the future, at any greater frequency or extent than they display at present.

He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.\n\nUniformitarianism was proposed in contrast to [[catastrophism]], which states that the distant past \"consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility\"<ref>William J. Whewell, ''Principles of Geology'', Charles Leyell, vol. II, London, 1832: Quart. Rev., v. 47, p. 103-123.</ref> Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the [[Channeled Scablands]] due to the catastrophic [[Missoula floods|Missoula]] glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.<ref>Allen, E.
