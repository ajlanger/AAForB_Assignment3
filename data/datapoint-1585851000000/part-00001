and symptoms==\nEpisodes of vasovagal syncope are typically recurrent and usually occur when the predisposed person is exposed to a specific trigger. Before losing consciousness, the individual frequently experiences early signs or symptoms such as [[lightheadedness]], nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak or form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost). Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing. Another possible cause is excessively quick consumption of ice cream, such as the McFlurry.\n\nWhen people lose consciousness, they fall down (unless prevented from doing so) and, when in this position, effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored, allowing the person to regain consciousness. If the person does not fall into a fully flat, supine position, and the head remains elevated above the trunk, a state similar to a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] may result from the blood's inability to return quickly to the brain, and the neurons in the body will fire off and generally cause muscles to twitch very slightly but mostly remain very tense.\n\nThe [[autonomic nervous system]]'s physiological state (see below) leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes, so\n* If sufferers try to sit or stand when they wake up, they may pass out again\n* The person may be nauseated, pale, and sweaty for several minutes or hours\n\n==Cause==\nReflex syncope occurs in response to a trigger due to dysfunction of the heart rate and blood pressure regulating mechanism. When heart rate slows or blood pressure drops, the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/dxc-20184778 |title=Vasovagal syncope: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=7 August 2010  |url-status=live |access-date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Vasovagal syncope===\nTypical triggers include:\n* Prolonged standing<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Emotional stress<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Pain<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* The sight of blood<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Time varying magnetic field<ref name=Rossi>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossi S, Hallett M, Rossini PM, Pascual-Leone A |title=Safety, ethical considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=2008\u20132039 |year=2009 |pmid=19833552 |pmc=3260536 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016|hdl=11572/145680 }}</ref> (i.e. [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]])\n\n===Situational syncope===\n* After or during urination ([[micturition syncope]])<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Straining, such as to have a bowel movement<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Coughing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Swallowing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Lifting a heavy weight<ref name=Ad2017/>\n\n===Carotid sinus syncope===\nPressing upon a certain spot in the neck.<ref name=NIH2017/> This may happen when wearing a tight collar, shaving, or turning the head.<ref name=NIH2017/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nRegardless of the trigger, the mechanism of syncope is similar in the various vasovagal syncope syndromes. The [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] of the [[brainstem]] is activated directly or indirectly by the triggering stimulus, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] ([[vagal]]) tone and withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n\nThis results in a spectrum of hemodynamic responses:\n# On one end of the spectrum is the cardioinhibitory response, characterized by a drop in heart rate (negative [[chronotropic]] effect) and in contractility (negative [[inotropic]] effect) leading to a decrease in cardiac output that is significant enough to result in a loss of consciousness. It is thought that this response results primarily from enhancement in [[parasympathetic tone]].\n# On the other end of the spectrum is the vasodepressor response, caused by a drop in blood pressure (to as low as 80/20) without much change in heart rate. This phenomenon occurs due to [[vasodilation|dilation of the blood vessels]], probably as a result of withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n# The majority of people with vasovagal syncope have a mixed response somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum.\n\nOne account for these physiological responses is the [[Bezold-Jarisch reflex]].\n\nVasovagal syncope may be an evolution response, specifically the [[fight-or-flight response]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal syncope in humans and protective reactions in animals|date=2015|vauthors=Blanc JJ, Alboni P, Benditt DG|pmid=25662986|doi=10.1093/europace/euu367|volume=17|issue=3|journal=Europace|pages=345\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal Syncope As A Manifestation Of An Evolutionary Selected Trait|journal=Journal of Atrial Fibrillation|date=2014|vauthors=Alboni P, Alboni M|pmc=5135249|pmid=27957092|doi=10.4022/jafib.1035|volume=7|issue=2|page=1035|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIn addition to the mechanism described above, a number of other medical conditions may cause [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].

Sports drinks or drinks with electrolytes may be helpful.\n* People should be educated on how to respond to further episodes of syncope, especially if they experience [[prodrome|prodromal]] warning signs: they should lie down and raise their legs, or at least lower their head to increase blood flow to the brain. At the very least, upon the onset of initial symptoms the patient should try to relocate to a 'safe', perhaps cushioned, location in case of losing consciousness. Positioning themselves in a way where the impact from falling or collapsing would be minimized is ideal. The 'safe' area should be within close proximity, since, time is of the essence and these symptoms usually climax to loss of consciousness within a matter of minutes. If the individual has lost consciousness, he or she should be laid down with his or her head turned to the side. Tight clothing should be loosened. If the inciting factor is known, it should be removed if possible (for instance, the cause of pain).\n* Wearing graded compression stockings may be helpful.\n\n===Medications===\n* Certain [[medications]] may  also be helpful:\n** [[Beta blocker]]s (\u03b2-adrenergic antagonists) were once the most common medication given; however, they have been shown to be ineffective in a variety of studies and are thus no longer prescribed.

syncope affects at least 1 per 1,000 people a year.<ref name=Ay2010/> It is the most common type of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], making up more than 50% of all cases.<ref name=Ad2017/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nEpisodes of vasovagal syncope are typically recurrent and usually occur when the predisposed person is exposed to a specific trigger. Before losing consciousness, the individual frequently experiences early signs or symptoms such as [[lightheadedness]], nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak or form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost). Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing.\n\nWhen people lose consciousness, they fall down (unless prevented from doing so) and, when in this position, effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored, allowing the person to regain consciousness. If the person does not fall into a fully flat, supine position, and the head remains elevated above the trunk, a state similar to a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] may result from the blood's inability to return quickly to the brain, and the neurons in the body will fire off and generally cause muscles to twitch very slightly but mostly remain very tense.\n\nThe [[autonomic nervous system]]'s physiological state (see below) leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes, so\n* If sufferers try to sit or stand when they wake up, they may pass out again\n* The person may be nauseated, pale, and sweaty for several minutes or hours\n\n==Cause==\nReflex syncope occurs in response to a trigger due to dysfunction of the heart rate and blood pressure regulating mechanism. When heart rate slows or blood pressure drops, the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/dxc-20184778 |title=Vasovagal syncope: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=7 August 2010  |url-status=live |access-date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Vasovagal syncope===\nTypical triggers include:\n* Prolonged standing<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Emotional stress<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Pain<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* The sight of blood<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Time varying magnetic field<ref name=Rossi>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossi S, Hallett M, Rossini PM, Pascual-Leone A |title=Safety, ethical considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=2008\u20132039 |year=2009 |pmid=19833552 |pmc=3260536 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016|hdl=11572/145680 }}</ref> (i.e. [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]])\n\n===Situational syncope===\n* After or during urination ([[micturition syncope]])<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Straining, such as to have a bowel movement<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Coughing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Swallowing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Lifting a heavy weight<ref name=Ad2017/>\n\n===Carotid sinus syncope===\nPressing upon a certain spot in the neck.<ref name=NIH2017/> This may happen when wearing a tight collar, shaving, or turning the head.<ref name=NIH2017/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nRegardless of the trigger, the mechanism of syncope is similar in the various vasovagal syncope syndromes. The [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] of the [[brainstem]] is activated directly or indirectly by the triggering stimulus, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] ([[vagal]]) tone and withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n\nThis results in a spectrum of hemodynamic responses:\n# On one end of the spectrum is the cardioinhibitory response, characterized by a drop in heart rate (negative [[chronotropic]] effect) and in contractility (negative [[inotropic]] effect) leading to a decrease in cardiac output that is significant enough to result in a loss of consciousness. It is thought that this response results primarily from enhancement in [[parasympathetic tone]].\n# On the other end of the spectrum is the vasodepressor response, caused by a drop in blood pressure (to as low as 80/20) without much change in heart rate. This phenomenon occurs due to [[vasodilation|dilation of the blood vessels]], probably as a result of withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n# The majority of people with vasovagal syncope have a mixed response somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum.\n\nOne account for these physiological responses is the [[Bezold-Jarisch reflex]].\n\nVasovagal syncope may be an evolution response, specifically the [[fight-or-flight response]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal syncope in humans and protective reactions in animals|date=2015|vauthors=Blanc JJ, Alboni P, Benditt DG|pmid=25662986|doi=10.1093/europace/euu367|volume=17|issue=3|journal=Europace|pages=345\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal Syncope As A Manifestation Of An Evolutionary Selected Trait|journal=Journal of Atrial Fibrillation|date=2014|vauthors=Alboni P, Alboni M|pmc=5135249|pmid=27957092|doi=10.4022/jafib.1035|volume=7|issue=2|page=1035|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIn addition to the mechanism described above, a number of other medical conditions may cause [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].

Sports drinks or drinks with electrolytes may be helpful.\n* People should be educated on how to respond to further episodes of syncope, especially if they experience [[prodrome|prodromal]] warning signs: they should lie down and raise their legs, or at least lower their head to increase blood flow to the brain. At the very least, upon the onset of initial symptoms the patient should try to relocate to a 'safe', perhaps cushioned, location in case of losing consciousness. Positioning themselves in a way where the impact from falling or collapsing would be minimized is ideal. The 'safe' area should be within close proximity, since, time is of the essence and these symptoms usually climax to loss of consciousness within a matter of minutes. If the individual has lost consciousness, he or she should be laid down with his or her head turned to the side. Tight clothing should be loosened. If the inciting factor is known, it should be removed if possible (for instance, the cause of pain).\n* Wearing graded compression stockings may be helpful.\n\n===Medications===\n* Certain [[medications]] may  also be helpful:\n** [[Beta blocker]]s (\u03b2-adrenergic antagonists) were once the most common medication given; however, they have been shown to be ineffective in a variety of studies and are thus no longer prescribed.
