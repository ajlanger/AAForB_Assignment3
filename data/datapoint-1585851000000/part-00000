She was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Gottlieb's professional career spans more than 50 years. She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia.  Lois Davidson was an apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a part of the [[Taliesin West|Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona,]] and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948-1949. \n\n== Education ==\nGottlieb attended [[Stanford University]], where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947. \n\nIn the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House [1936] near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\" Driven by the appreciation for, and a desire to learn more about the design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \"a way of life\". Gottlieb was one of the few women who have been apprenticed to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gottlieb, Lois Davidson.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47063813|title=A way of life : an apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright|date=2001|publisher=Images Pub.
