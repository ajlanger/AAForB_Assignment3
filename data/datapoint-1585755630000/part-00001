Born into a working-class family in south Wales, he was the son of a coal miner. He left school at 13 and worked as a miner during his teens where he became involved in local union politics. He was named head of his Miner's Lodge when aged 19, where he frequently railed against management. He joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and attended [[Central Labour College]] in London. On his return to south Wales he struggled to find work, remaining unemployed for nearly three years before gaining employment as a union official, which led to him becoming a leading figure in the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]].\n\nIn 1928, Bevan won a seat on [[Monmouthshire County Council]] and was elected as the [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Ebbw Vale (UK Parliament constituency)|Ebbw Vale]] the following year. In Parliament, he became a vocal critic of numerous other politicians from all parties, including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]]. His criticisms of Churchill and the Conservative government during the [[Second World War]] raised him to national prominence. After the war, Bevan was chosen as the Minister of Health in [[Clement Attlee]]'s new Labour government, becoming the youngest member of the cabinet at 47, with his remit also including housing. Inspired by the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]] in his hometown, Bevan led the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] to provide medical care free at point-of-need to all Britons, regardless of wealth. Despite opposition from both his own and opposition parties as well as the [[British Medical Association]], the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] was passed, nationalising more than 2,500 hospitals within the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nBevan was named [[Secretary of State for Employment#Minister of Labour and National Service|Minister of Labour]] in 1951, but resigned after two months in office, when the Attlee government proposed the introduction of prescription charges for dental and vision care and decided to transfer funds from the [[National Insurance Fund]] to pay for rearmament. His influence waned after his departure, although a left-wing group (not under his control) within the party became known as \"[[Bevanite]]s\". When Attlee retired in 1955, Bevan unsuccessfully contested the party leadership with [[Hugh Gaitskell]], but was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Shadow Colonial Secretary]] and later [[Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Shadow Foreign Secretary]]. In 1959, he was elected [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] and held the post for a year until his death from stomach cancer at the age of 62.\n\nBevan's death in 1960 led to \"an outpouring of national mourning\". In 2004, more than forty-four years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the founding of the [[welfare state]] in the UK.\n\n==Early life==\nAneurin Bevan was born on 15 November 1897 at 32 Charles Street in [[Tredegar]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], a working-class mining town, where an estimated 90 per cent of the town's inhabitants relied on the local mines for employment.<ref name=\"Foot1113\">{{harvnb|Foot|1966|pp=11\u201313}}</ref> The town was situated in the [[South Wales Valleys]] and was on the northern edge of the [[South Wales coalfield]]. He was the son of coal miner David Bevan and Phoebe ({{nee}} Prothero), a seamstress. David Bevan was born in Tredegar but his family had originally hailed from [[Carmarthenshire]], and he followed his own father into the mines, starting work at 5:30am each day and returning home late in the evening. He was adept at construction and added several modern features when the family moved to 7 Charles Street, installing the first gas stove in the street, an inside toilet and running hot water.<ref name=\"Foot1113\"/>\n\nBoth Bevan's parents were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s: his father was a [[Baptist]] and his mother a [[Methodist]]. David Bevan had been a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in his youth, but was converted to socialism by the writings of [[Robert Blatchford]] in ''[[The Clarion]]'' and joined the [[Independent Labour Party]]. It was around this time that he first \"reject[ed] his chapel upbringing\" and became an atheist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/TUbevan.htm|title=History of Socialism: Aneurin Bevan|work=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] and wrote his own poems, one of which won an inter-chapel [[eisteddfod]]. Aneurin's mother was also from Tredegar, but had English roots: her grandfather was from [[Hereford]]. Bevan's maternal grandfather John was a blacksmith who had moved to Tredegar from [[Hay-on-Wye]] to work in the Bedwellty mines.<ref name=\"Foot1113\"/><ref name=\"ts16\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe couple had ten children altogether\u2014six boys and four girls\u2014although four died in infancy and one died at the age of eight.<ref>{{harvnb|Foot|1966|p=14}}</ref> Aneurin Bevan attended Sirhowy Elementary School, where he achieved little. He developed a severe stammer as a child and, according to his younger sister Myfanwy, became \"a lonely chap\", due to the need to shy away from the attention it brought him.<ref name=\"ts24\"/>\n\n==Working life as a miner==\nAt the age of thirteen, in his last month's of schooling, he worked as a butcher's boy at a local store.<ref name=\"ts19\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=19}}</ref> He worked at the butchers for several months before leaving school and instead working in the local Ty-Trist [[Colliery]]. Here, he earned around ten [[shillings]] per week with most of his money going to his parents to help support the family. He began attending fortnightly meetings of the local [[Plebs' League]] where he studied, among other things, [[Marxism]].<ref name=\"ts24\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=24}}</ref> Bevan also joined the Tredegar branch of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] and became a [[trade union]] activist: he was head of his local Miners' Lodge at only nineteen years of age. He was called up for service during the [[First World War]], and was briefly arrested when his sister Blodwen burnt his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#First World War|conscription]] papers and he failed to report for duty. Bevan appeared in court but was cleared when he produced confirmation that he suffered from [[nystagmus]].<ref name=\"Foot2728\">{{harvnb|Foot|1966|pp=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nBevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the [[Tredegar Iron and Coal Company|Tredegar Iron Company]], as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]]. But, with the support of the Miners' Federation, the case was judged as one of victimisation and the company was forced to re-employ him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thevalleys.co.uk/media/144237/Nye%20Bevan%20Festival%20programme.pdf |title=Nye Bevan Festival |publisher=GMB |format=PDF |accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"bbclegacy\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8792000/8792227.stm |title=Enduring legacy of Aneurin Bevan |work=BBC News |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref> He and his brother Billy did eventually leave Ty-Tryst and instead worked at the Bedwellty pit but were forced to move on again after a disagreement with the site's deputy manager over Bevan reporting information to the miner's inspector. The pair moved on to work at Whitworth Colliery but fell foul of management again when Bevan refused to use cheaper second-hand timber as he deemed it unsafe. He was later fired for refusing to unload, and successfully challenged the motion but was moved to Pochin, generally considered a punishment due to the poor site conditions.<ref name=\"ts25\"/>\n\n1919 saw the foundation of the Tredegar Labour Party and Bevan was selected as one of four Labour delegates to contest the West Ward in the Tredegar Urban District election. Although he was defeated, he gained attention from his peers and he won a scholarship to the [[Central Labour College]] in London, sponsored by the South Wales Miners' Federation. There, he spent two years studying economics, politics and history. He read Marxism at the college and was a brief follower of [[Noah Ablett]],<ref name=\"Foot3032\">{{harvnb|Foot|1966|pp=30\u201332}}</ref><ref name=\"ns\"/> developing his left-wing political outlook. Reciting long passages by [[William Morris]] with the help of an [[elocution]] tutor, Bevan gradually began to overcome the stammer that he had suffered with since childhood.<ref name=\"Foot3032\"/> Bevan remained at the College until 1921, attending at a time when a number of his contemporaries from South Wales, including [[Jim Griffiths]], were also students at the College. However, some historians have questioned how influential the College was on his political development. He was not, apparently, one of the most diligent students, and found it difficult to follow an organised routine, including getting up early for breakfast.{{sfn|Morgan|1981|pp=196\u20137}}\n\n[[File:ClubqueryWConwayBevan2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[:en:Tredegar|Tredegar Query Club]] by friends including Aneurin Bevan and [[Walter Conway]].

Conway was a local miner who had been elected to the Bedwellty Board of Guardians and offered Bevan advice on overcoming his stammer, stating \"if you can't say it, you don't know it\". Bevan followed his advice, often practising his speeches to his friends in order to perfect his speech and wording, and remarked that Conway's words were the \"best advice I ever had\".<ref name=\"ts25\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=25}}</ref> The Query club started in 1920 or 1921 and they met in Tredegar. They would collect money each week for any member who needed it. The club intended to break the hold that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company had on the town by becoming members of pivotal groups in the community.<ref name=BevanQ/>\n\nUpon returning home in 1921, he found that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company refused to re-employ him; Bevan even ended up in a fist-fight with a group of miners who refused to strike over his rejection.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=32}}</ref> Apart from a six-week spell as a labourer for Tredegar Council, he did not find work until 1924 and his employer, the [[Bedwellty]] Colliery, closed down only ten months later. Bevan then had to endure another year of unemployment, the family surviving on his sister's wages, when his unemployment benefit was stopped due to her income, and his father's sick pay. In February 1925, his father died of [[pneumoconiosis]], an illness caused by the inhalation of coal dust.<ref name=\"foot13\">Foot, vol. 1, ch. 3.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dying-father-inspired-nye-bevans-2154183 |title=Dying father inspired Nye Bevan's NHS dream |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> In 1926, he found work again, this time as a paid union official. His wage of \u00a35 a week was paid by the members of the local Miners' Lodge. His new job arrived in time for him to head the local miners against the colliery companies during the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]]. When the strike started on 3 May 1926, Bevan soon emerged as one of the leaders of the South Wales miners.<ref name=\"bbclegacy\"/> The miners remained on strike for six months. Bevan was largely responsible for the distribution of [[strike pay]] in Tredegar and the formation of the Council of Action, an organisation that helped to raise money and provided food for the miners.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/figures/aneurin_bevan.shtml |title=Aneurin Bevan (1897\u20131960) |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Parliament==\n===MP for Ebbw Vale===\nIn 1928, Bevan won a seat on [[Monmouthshire County Council]] in the Tredegar Central Division.

Along that road is endless retreat, and at the end of it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=77}}</blockquote>\n\nHowever the Labour conference voted to drop its opposition to rearmament. When [[Winston Churchill]] said that the Labour Party should refrain from giving Hitler the impression that Britain was divided, Bevan rejected this as sinister: <blockquote>The fear of Hitler is to be used to frighten the workers of Britain into silence. In short Hitler is to rule Britain by proxy. If we accept the contention that the common enemy is Hitler and not the British capitalist class, then certainly Churchill is right. But it means abandonment of the class struggle and the subservience of the British workers to their own employers.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=77}}</blockquote>\n\n===Opposition to the war-time government===\nBy March 1938, Bevan was writing in ''Tribune'' that Churchill's warnings about German intentions for [[Czechoslovakia]] were \"a diapason of majestic harmony\" compared to Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s \"thin, listless trickle\".{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=80}} Bevan now called unsuccessfully for a [[Popular Front (UK)|Popular Front]] against fascism under the leadership of the Labour Party, including even anti-fascist Tories.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=80}} When the government introduced voluntary national service in December 1938, Bevan argued that Labour should demand the nationalisation of the armaments industry, support the  [[Second Spanish Republic|democratic government of Spain]] and sign an [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pact in return for its support. When Labour supported the government's scheme with no such conditions, Bevan denounced Labour for imploring the people on recruiting platforms to put themselves under the leadership of their opponents.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=82}} The [[Military Training Act 1939]] reintroduced [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]] six months later, and Bevan joined the rest of the Labour Party in opposing it, calling it \"the complete abandonment of any hope of a successful struggle against the weight of wealth in Great Britain\".{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=85}} He emphasised that the government had no arguments to persuade young men to fight \"except merely in another squalid attempt to defend themselves against the redistribution of international swag\".{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=85}}\n\nIn August 1939 came the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], a non-aggression pact between the Nazi and Russian governments that shocked democratic governments around the world. In Parliament, Bevan argued that this was the logical outcome of the government's foreign policy. He wanted the war to be not just a fight against fascism but a war for socialism.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|pp=85\u201386}} Bevan was relieved that the country had united against Nazi Germany in the fight against fascism to provide a common enemy away from the working class.<ref name=\"ts94\"/> He was a strong critic of Chamberlain, arguing that his old rival Winston Churchill should become prime minister.<ref name=\"ns\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] he was one of the main leaders of the left in the Commons, opposing the wartime Coalition government. Bevan opposed the heavy censorship imposed on radio and newspapers and wartime [[Defence Regulation 18B]], which gave the Home Secretary the powers to intern citizens.

1897&nbsp;\u2013 6 July 1960), often known as '''Nye Bevan''', was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician. Born into a working-class family in south Wales, he was the son of a coal miner. He left school at 13 and worked as a miner during his teens where he became involved in local union politics. He was named head of his Miner's Lodge when aged 19, where he frequently railed against management. He joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and attended [[Central Labour College]] in London. On his return to south Wales he struggled to find work, remaining unemployed for nearly three years before gaining employment as a union official, which led to him becoming a leading figure in the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]].\n\nIn 1928, Bevan won a seat on [[Monmouthshire County Council]] and was elected as the [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Ebbw Vale (UK Parliament constituency)|Ebbw Vale]] the following year. In Parliament, he became a vocal critic of numerous other politicians from all parties, including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]]. His criticisms of Churchill and the Conservative government during the [[Second World War]] raised him to national prominence. After the war, Bevan was chosen as the Minister of Health in [[Clement Attlee]]'s new Labour government, becoming the youngest member of the cabinet at 47, with his remit also including housing. Inspired by the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]] in his hometown, Bevan led the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] to provide medical care free at point-of-need to all Britons, regardless of wealth. Despite opposition from both his own and opposition parties as well as the [[British Medical Association]], the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] was passed, nationalising more than 2,500 hospitals within the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nBevan was named [[Secretary of State for Employment#Minister of Labour and National Service|Minister of Labour]] in 1951, but resigned after two months in office, when the Attlee government proposed the introduction of prescription charges for dental and vision care and decided to transfer funds from the [[National Insurance Fund]] to pay for rearmament. His influence waned after his departure, although a left-wing group (not under his control) within the party became known as \"[[Bevanite]]s\". When Attlee retired in 1955, Bevan unsuccessfully contested the party leadership with [[Hugh Gaitskell]], but was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Shadow Colonial Secretary]] and later [[Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Shadow Foreign Secretary]]. In 1959, he was elected [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] and held the post for a year until his death from stomach cancer at the age of 62.\n\nBevan's death in 1960 led to \"an outpouring of national mourning\". In 2004, more than forty-four years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the founding of the [[welfare state]] in the UK.\n\n==Early life==\nAneurin Bevan was born on 15 November 1897 at 32 Charles Street in [[Tredegar]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], a working-class mining town, where an estimated 90 per cent of the town's inhabitants relied on the local mines for employment.<ref name=\"Foot1113\">{{harvnb|Foot|1966|pp=11\u201313}}</ref> The town was situated in the [[South Wales Valleys]] and was on the northern edge of the [[South Wales coalfield]]. He was the son of coal miner David Bevan and Phoebe ({{nee}} Prothero), a seamstress. David Bevan was born in Tredegar but his family had originally hailed from [[Carmarthenshire]], and he followed his own father into the mines, starting work at 5:30am each day and returning home late in the evening. He was adept at construction and added several modern features when the family moved to 7 Charles Street, installing the first gas stove in the street, an inside toilet and running hot water.<ref name=\"Foot1113\"/>\n\nBoth Bevan's parents were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s: his father was a [[Baptist]] and his mother a [[Methodist]]. David Bevan had been a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in his youth, but was converted to socialism by the writings of [[Robert Blatchford]] in ''[[The Clarion]]'' and joined the [[Independent Labour Party]]. It was around this time that he first \"reject[ed] his chapel upbringing\" and became an atheist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/TUbevan.htm|title=History of Socialism: Aneurin Bevan|work=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] and wrote his own poems, one of which won an inter-chapel [[eisteddfod]]. Aneurin's mother was also from Tredegar, but had English roots: her grandfather was from [[Hereford]]. Bevan's maternal grandfather John was a blacksmith who had moved to Tredegar from [[Hay-on-Wye]] to work in the Bedwellty mines.<ref name=\"Foot1113\"/><ref name=\"ts16\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe couple had ten children altogether\u2014six boys and four girls\u2014although four died in infancy and one died at the age of eight.<ref>{{harvnb|Foot|1966|p=14}}</ref> Aneurin Bevan attended Sirhowy Elementary School, where he achieved little. He developed a severe stammer as a child and, according to his younger sister Myfanwy, became \"a lonely chap\", due to the need to shy away from the attention it brought him.<ref name=\"ts24\"/>\n\n==Working life as a miner==\nAt the age of thirteen, in his last month's of schooling, he worked as a butcher's boy at a local store.<ref name=\"ts19\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=19}}</ref> He worked at the butchers for several months before leaving school and instead working in the local Ty-Trist [[Colliery]]. Here, he earned around ten [[shillings]] per week with most of his money going to his parents to help support the family. He began attending fortnightly meetings of the local [[Plebs' League]] where he studied, among other things, [[Marxism]].<ref name=\"ts24\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=24}}</ref> Bevan also joined the Tredegar branch of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] and became a [[trade union]] activist: he was head of his local Miners' Lodge at only nineteen years of age. He was called up for service during the [[First World War]], and was briefly arrested when his sister Blodwen burnt his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#First World War|conscription]] papers and he failed to report for duty. Bevan appeared in court but was cleared when he produced confirmation that he suffered from [[nystagmus]].<ref name=\"Foot2728\">{{harvnb|Foot|1966|pp=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nBevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the [[Tredegar Iron and Coal Company|Tredegar Iron Company]], as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]]. But, with the support of the Miners' Federation, the case was judged as one of victimisation and the company was forced to re-employ him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thevalleys.co.uk/media/144237/Nye%20Bevan%20Festival%20programme.pdf |title=Nye Bevan Festival |publisher=GMB |format=PDF |accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"bbclegacy\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8792000/8792227.stm |title=Enduring legacy of Aneurin Bevan |work=BBC News |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref> He and his brother Billy did eventually leave Ty-Tryst and instead worked at the Bedwellty pit but were forced to move on again after a disagreement with the site's deputy manager over Bevan reporting information to the miner's inspector. The pair moved on to work at Whitworth Colliery but fell foul of management again when Bevan refused to use cheaper second-hand timber as he deemed it unsafe. He was later fired for refusing to unload, and successfully challenged the motion but was moved to Pochin, generally considered a punishment due to the poor site conditions.<ref name=\"ts25\"/>\n\n1919 saw the foundation of the Tredegar Labour Party and Bevan was selected as one of four Labour delegates to contest the West Ward in the Tredegar Urban District election. Although he was defeated, he gained attention from his peers and he won a scholarship to the [[Central Labour College]] in London, sponsored by the South Wales Miners' Federation. There, he spent two years studying economics, politics and history. He read Marxism at the college and was a brief follower of [[Noah Ablett]],<ref name=\"Foot3032\">{{harvnb|Foot|1966|pp=30\u201332}}</ref><ref name=\"ns\"/> developing his left-wing political outlook. Reciting long passages by [[William Morris]] with the help of an [[elocution]] tutor, Bevan gradually began to overcome the stammer that he had suffered with since childhood.<ref name=\"Foot3032\"/> Bevan remained at the College until 1921, attending at a time when a number of his contemporaries from South Wales, including [[Jim Griffiths]], were also students at the College. However, some historians have questioned how influential the College was on his political development. He was not, apparently, one of the most diligent students, and found it difficult to follow an organised routine, including getting up early for breakfast.{{sfn|Morgan|1981|pp=196\u20137}}\n\n[[File:ClubqueryWConwayBevan2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[:en:Tredegar|Tredegar Query Club]] by friends including Aneurin Bevan and [[Walter Conway]].

Conway was a local miner who had been elected to the Bedwellty Board of Guardians and offered Bevan advice on overcoming his stammer, stating \"if you can't say it, you don't know it\". Bevan followed his advice, often practising his speeches to his friends in order to perfect his speech and wording, and remarked that Conway's words were the \"best advice I ever had\".<ref name=\"ts25\">{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=25}}</ref> The Query club started in 1920 or 1921 and they met in Tredegar. They would collect money each week for any member who needed it. The club intended to break the hold that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company had on the town by becoming members of pivotal groups in the community.<ref name=BevanQ/>\n\nUpon returning home in 1921, he found that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company refused to re-employ him; Bevan even ended up in a fist-fight with a group of miners who refused to strike over his rejection.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas-Symonds|2014|p=32}}</ref> Apart from a six-week spell as a labourer for Tredegar Council, he did not find work until 1924 and his employer, the [[Bedwellty]] Colliery, closed down only ten months later. Bevan then had to endure another year of unemployment, the family surviving on his sister's wages, when his unemployment benefit was stopped due to her income, and his father's sick pay. In February 1925, his father died of [[pneumoconiosis]], an illness caused by the inhalation of coal dust.<ref name=\"foot13\">Foot, vol. 1, ch. 3.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dying-father-inspired-nye-bevans-2154183 |title=Dying father inspired Nye Bevan's NHS dream |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> In 1926, he found work again, this time as a paid union official. His wage of \u00a35 a week was paid by the members of the local Miners' Lodge. His new job arrived in time for him to head the local miners against the colliery companies during the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]]. When the strike started on 3 May 1926, Bevan soon emerged as one of the leaders of the South Wales miners.<ref name=\"bbclegacy\"/> The miners remained on strike for six months.

Along that road is endless retreat, and at the end of it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=77}}</blockquote>\n\nHowever the Labour conference voted to drop its opposition to rearmament.

When Labour supported the government's scheme with no such conditions, Bevan denounced Labour for imploring the people on recruiting platforms to put themselves under the leadership of their opponents.{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=82}} The [[Military Training Act 1939]] reintroduced [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]] six months later, and Bevan joined the rest of the Labour Party in opposing it, calling it \"the complete abandonment of any hope of a successful struggle against the weight of wealth in Great Britain\".{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=85}} He emphasised that the government had no arguments to persuade young men to fight \"except merely in another squalid attempt to defend themselves against the redistribution of international swag\".{{sfn|Campbell|1987|p=85}}\n\nIn August 1939 came the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], a non-aggression pact between the Nazi and Russian governments that shocked democratic governments around the world.
