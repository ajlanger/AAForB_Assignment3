Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]].

The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss]] 'Samitaur' building in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]].
