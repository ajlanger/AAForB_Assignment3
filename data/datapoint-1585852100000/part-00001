A common type of I-beam is the ''rolled steel joist'' (RSJ)\u2014sometimes incorrectly rendered as ''reinforced steel joist''. [[British Standard|British]] and [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, as opposed to the varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for tapering washers. UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.\n\n[[I-joist]]s\u2014I-beams engineered from wood with [[fiberboard]] and/or [[laminated veneer lumber]]\u2014are also becoming increasingly popular in construction, especially residential, as they are both lighter and less prone to warping than solid wooden [[joist]]s. However, there has been some concern as to their rapid loss of strength in a fire if unprotected.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Beam mode 2.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.20|Illustration of an I-beam vibrating in torsion mode.]]\nI-beams are widely used in the [[construction industry]] and are available in a variety of standard sizes. Tables are available to allow easy selection of a suitable steel I-beam size for a given applied load. I-beams may be used both as beams and as [[column]]s.\n\nI-beams may be used both on their own, or acting [[composite material|compositely]] with another material, typically [[concrete]]. Design may be governed by any of the following criteria:\n* [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]: the [[stiffness]] of the I-beam will be chosen to minimize deformation\n* [[vibration]]: the stiffness and [[mass]] are chosen to prevent unacceptable vibrations, particularly in settings sensitive to vibrations, such as offices and libraries\n* bending failure by [[yield (engineering)|yielding]]: where the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the cross section exceeds the [[yield stress]]\n* bending failure by [[Buckling#Lateral-torsional buckling|lateral torsional buckling]]: where a flange in compression tends to buckle sideways or the entire cross-section buckles torsionally\n* bending failure by [[Buckling#Local buckling|local buckling]]: where the flange or web is so slender as to buckle locally\n* local yield: caused by concentrated loads, such as at the beam's point of support\n* [[shear failure]]: where the web fails. Slender webs will fail by buckling, rippling in a phenomenon termed '''tension field action''', but shear failure is also resisted by the stiffness of the flanges\n* buckling or yielding of components: for example, of stiffeners used to provide stability to the I-beam's web.\n\n=== Design for bending ===\n[[File:Poutre flexion deviee.svg|thumb|upright=1.80|The largest stresses (<math>\\sigma_{xx}</math>) in a beam under bending are in the locations farthest from the neutral axis.]]\n\nA beam under bending sees high stresses along the axial fibers that are farthest from the [[neutral axis]].  To prevent failure, most of the material in the beam must be located in these regions.  Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the neutral axis.  This observation is the basis of the I-beam cross-section; the neutral axis runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.\n\nThe ideal beam is the one with the least cross-sectional area (and hence requiring the least material) needed to achieve a given [[section modulus]].  Since the section modulus depends on the value of the [[second moment of area|moment of inertia]], an efficient beam must have most of its material located as far from the neutral axis as possible.  The farther a given amount of material is from the neutral axis, the larger is the section modulus and hence a larger bending moment can be resisted.\n\nWhen designing a symmetric I-beam to resist stresses due to bending the usual starting point is the required section modulus.  If the allowable stress is <math>\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}</math> and the maximum expected bending moment is <math>M_{\\mathrm{max}}</math>, then the required section modulus is given by<ref name=Gere />\n:<math>\n   S = \\cfrac{M_{\\mathrm{max}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\cfrac{I}{c}\n </math>\nwhere <math>I</math> is the moment of inertia of the beam cross-section and <math>c</math> is the distance of the top of the beam from the neutral axis (see [[beam theory]] for more details).\n\nFor a beam of cross-sectional area <math>a</math> and height <math>h</math>, the ideal cross-section would have half the area at a distance <math>h/2</math> above the cross-section and the other half at a distance <math>h/2</math> below the cross-section<ref name=Gere>Gere and Timoshenko, 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.</ref>  For this cross-section\n:<math>\n   I = \\cfrac{ah^2}{4} ~;~~ S = 0.5 a h\n </math>\nHowever, these ideal conditions can never be achieved because material is needed in the web for physical reasons, including to resist buckling.  For wide-flange beams, the section modulus is approximately\n:<math>\n   S \\approx 0.35 a h\n </math>\nwhich is superior to that achieved by rectangular beams and circular beams.\n\n=== Issues ===\nThough I-beams are excellent for unidirectional bending in a plane parallel to the web, they do not perform as well in bidirectional bending.  These beams also show little resistance to twisting and undergo sectional warping under torsional loading.  For torsion dominated problems, [[box beam]]s and other types of stiff sections are used in preference to the I-beam.\n\n== Wide-flange steel materials and rolling processes (U.S.) ==\n[[File:Rostiger Stahltraeger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.10|Rusty riveted steel I-beam]]\n\nIn the United States, the most commonly mentioned I-beam is the wide-flange (W) shape. These beams have flanges in which the planes are nearly parallel. Other I-beams include American Standard (designated S) shapes, in which flange surfaces are not parallel, and H-piles (designated HP), which are typically used as pile foundations. Wide-flange shapes are available in grade ASTM A992,<ref>{{cite web\n |author=\n |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/A992.htm\n |title=ASTM A992?A992M Standard Specification for Structural Steel Shapes\n |publisher=[[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]]\n |year=2006\n |doi=10.1520/A0992_A0992M-06A\n}}</ref> which has generally replaced the older ASTM grades A572 and A36.

It documents the common approaches, [[Allowable Stress Design]] (ASD) and [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD), (starting with 13th ed.) to create such designs.\n\n== Standards ==\nThe following standards define the shape and tolerances of I-beam steel sections:\n\n=== Euronorms ===\n* [[EN 10024]], Hot rolled taper flange I sections \u2013 Tolerances on shape and dimensions.\n* [[EN 10034]], Structural steel I and H sections \u2013 Tolerances on shape and dimensions.\n* [[EN 10162]], Cold rolled steel sections \u2013 Technical delivery conditions \u2013 Dimensional and cross-sectional tolerances\n\n=== Other ===\n* [[DIN 1025-5]]\n* [[ASTM A6]], American Standard Beams\n* [[BS 4-1]]\n* [[IS 808]] \u2013 Dimensions hot rolled steel beam, column, channel and angle sections\n* [[AS/NZS 3679.1]] \u2013 Australia and New Zealand standard<ref name=onesteel>[http://www.onesteel.com/images/db_images/productspecs/Hot_Rolled_Cat_Issue5_Feb2010.pdf Hot rolled and structural steel products \u2013 Fifth edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410021605/http://www.onesteel.com/images/db_images/productspecs/Hot_Rolled_Cat_Issue5_Feb2010.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }} \u2014 [[Onesteel]]. Retrieved 18 December 2015.</ref>\n\n== Designation and terminology ==\n[[File:i-BeamCrossSection.svg|thumb|Wide-flange I-beam.]]\n* In the '''United States''', steel I-beams are commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam. For example, a \"W10x22\" beam is approximately {{Cvt|10|in|cm|0}} in depth (nominal height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs  {{cvt|22|lb/ft}}. Wide flange section beams often vary from their nominal depth.  In the case of the W14 series, they may be as deep as {{cvt|22.84|in|cm|1}}.<ref>AISC Manual of Steel Construction 14th Edition</ref>\n* In '''Canada''', steel I-beams are now commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam in metric terms. For example, a \"W250x33\" beam is approximately {{Convert|250|mm|in|1}} in depth (height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs approximately {{cvt|33|kg/m}}.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Handbook of Steel Construction\n |edition=9th\n |publisher=[[Canadian Institute of Steel Construction]]\n |year=2006\n |isbn=978-0-88811-124-1\n}}</ref> I-beams are still available in U.S. sizes from many Canadian manufacturers.\n* In '''Mexico''', steel I-beams are called IR and commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam in metric terms. For example, a \"IR250x33\" beam is approximately {{cvt|250|mm|in|1}} in depth (height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs approximately {{cvt|33|kg/m|lb/ft}}.<ref>IMCA Manual of Steel Construction, 5th Edition.</ref>\n* In '''India''' I-beams are designated as ISMB, ISJB, ISLB, ISWB. ISMB: Indian Standard Medium Weight Beam, ISJB: Indian Standard Junior Beams, ISLB: Indian Standard Light Weight Beams, and ISWB: Indian Standard Wide Flange Beams. Beams are designated as per respective abbreviated reference followed by the depth of section, such as for example \"ISMB 450\", where 450 is the depth of section in millimetres (mm). The dimensions of these beams are classified as per IS:808 (as per [[Bureau of Indian Standards|BIS]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n* In the '''United Kingdom''', these steel sections are commonly specified with a code consisting of the major dimension (usually the depth)-x-the minor dimension-x-the mass per metre-ending with the section type, all measurements being metric. Therefore, a 152x152x23UC would be a column section (UC = universal column) of approximately {{cvt|152|mm|in|1}} depth 152&nbsp;mm width and weighing {{cvt|23|kg/m|0}} of length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corusconstruction.com/file_source/StaticFiles/Construction/Library/BS4Sectionsbrochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215100102/http://www.corusconstruction.com/file_source/StaticFiles/Construction/Library/BS4Sectionsbrochure.pdf |archive-date=2010-02-15 |title=Structural sections |publisher=Corus Construction & Industrial |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n* In '''Australia''', these steel sections are commonly referred to as Universal Beams (UB) or Columns (UC). The designation for each is given as the approximate height of the beam, the type (beam or column) and then the unit metre rate (e.g., a 460UB67.1 is an approximately {{Cvt|460|mm|in|1}} deep universal beam that weighs {{Cvt|67.1|kg/m|0}}).<ref name=onesteel />\n\n=== American Standard Beams AISC  ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Type <br />!!

Slender webs will fail by buckling, rippling in a phenomenon termed '''tension field action''', but shear failure is also resisted by the stiffness of the flanges\n* buckling or yielding of components: for example, of stiffeners used to provide stability to the I-beam's web.\n\n=== Design for bending ===\n[[File:Poutre flexion deviee.svg|thumb|upright=1.80|The largest stresses (<math>\\sigma_{xx}</math>) in a beam under bending are in the locations farthest from the neutral axis.]]\n\nA beam under bending sees high stresses along the axial fibers that are farthest from the [[neutral axis]].  To prevent failure, most of the material in the beam must be located in these regions.  Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the neutral axis.  This observation is the basis of the I-beam cross-section; the neutral axis runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.\n\nThe ideal beam is the one with the least cross-sectional area (and hence requiring the least material) needed to achieve a given [[section modulus]].  Since the section modulus depends on the value of the [[second moment of area|moment of inertia]], an efficient beam must have most of its material located as far from the neutral axis as possible.  The farther a given amount of material is from the neutral axis, the larger is the section modulus and hence a larger bending moment can be resisted.\n\nWhen designing a symmetric I-beam to resist stresses due to bending the usual starting point is the required section modulus.  If the allowable stress is <math>\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}</math> and the maximum expected bending moment is <math>M_{\\mathrm{max}}</math>, then the required section modulus is given by<ref name=Gere />\n:<math>\n   S = \\cfrac{M_{\\mathrm{max}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\cfrac{I}{c}\n </math>\nwhere <math>I</math> is the moment of inertia of the beam cross-section and <math>c</math> is the distance of the top of the beam from the neutral axis (see [[beam theory]] for more details).\n\nFor a beam of cross-sectional area <math>a</math> and height <math>h</math>, the ideal cross-section would have half the area at a distance <math>h/2</math> above the cross-section and the other half at a distance <math>h/2</math> below the cross-section<ref name=Gere>Gere and Timoshenko, 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.</ref>  For this cross-section\n:<math>\n   I = \\cfrac{ah^2}{4} ~;~~ S = 0.5 a h\n </math>\nHowever, these ideal conditions can never be achieved because material is needed in the web for physical reasons, including to resist buckling.  For wide-flange beams, the section modulus is approximately\n:<math>\n   S \\approx 0.35 a h\n </math>\nwhich is superior to that achieved by rectangular beams and circular beams.\n\n=== Issues ===\nThough I-beams are excellent for unidirectional bending in a plane parallel to the web, they do not perform as well in bidirectional bending.  These beams also show little resistance to twisting and undergo sectional warping under torsional loading.  For torsion dominated problems, [[box beam]]s and other types of stiff sections are used in preference to the I-beam.\n\n== Wide-flange steel materials and rolling processes (U.S.) ==\n[[File:Rostiger Stahltraeger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.10|Rusty riveted steel I-beam]]\n\nIn the United States, the most commonly mentioned I-beam is the wide-flange (W) shape. These beams have flanges in which the planes are nearly parallel. Other I-beams include American Standard (designated S) shapes, in which flange surfaces are not parallel, and H-piles (designated HP), which are typically used as pile foundations. Wide-flange shapes are available in grade ASTM A992,<ref>{{cite web\n |author=\n |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/A992.htm\n |title=ASTM A992?A992M Standard Specification for Structural Steel Shapes\n |publisher=[[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]]\n |year=2006\n |doi=10.1520/A0992_A0992M-06A\n}}</ref> which has generally replaced the older ASTM grades A572 and A36.

It documents the common approaches, [[Allowable Stress Design]] (ASD) and [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD), (starting with 13th ed.) to create such designs.\n\n== Standards ==\nThe following standards define the shape and tolerances of I-beam steel sections:\n\n=== Euronorms ===\n* [[EN 10024]], Hot rolled taper flange I sections \u2013 Tolerances on shape and dimensions.\n* [[EN 10034]], Structural steel I and H sections \u2013 Tolerances on shape and dimensions.\n* [[EN 10162]], Cold rolled steel sections \u2013 Technical delivery conditions \u2013 Dimensional and cross-sectional tolerances\n\n=== Other ===\n* [[DIN 1025-5]]\n* [[ASTM A6]], American Standard Beams\n* [[BS 4-1]]\n* [[IS 808]] \u2013 Dimensions hot rolled steel beam, column, channel and angle sections\n* [[AS/NZS 3679.1]] \u2013 Australia and New Zealand standard<ref name=onesteel>[http://www.onesteel.com/images/db_images/productspecs/Hot_Rolled_Cat_Issue5_Feb2010.pdf Hot rolled and structural steel products \u2013 Fifth edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410021605/http://www.onesteel.com/images/db_images/productspecs/Hot_Rolled_Cat_Issue5_Feb2010.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }} \u2014 [[Onesteel]]. Retrieved 18 December 2015.</ref>\n\n== Designation and terminology ==\n[[File:i-BeamCrossSection.svg|thumb|Wide-flange I-beam.]]\n* In the '''United States''', steel I-beams are commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam. For example, a \"W10x22\" beam is approximately {{Cvt|10|in|cm|0}} in depth (nominal height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs  {{cvt|22|lb/ft}}. Wide flange section beams often vary from their nominal depth.  In the case of the W14 series, they may be as deep as {{cvt|22.84|in|cm|1}}.<ref>AISC Manual of Steel Construction 14th Edition</ref>\n* In '''Canada''', steel I-beams are now commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam in metric terms. For example, a \"W250x33\" beam is approximately {{Convert|250|mm|in|1}} in depth (height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs approximately {{cvt|33|kg/m}}.<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Handbook of Steel Construction\n |edition=9th\n |publisher=[[Canadian Institute of Steel Construction]]\n |year=2006\n |isbn=978-0-88811-124-1\n}}</ref> I-beams are still available in U.S. sizes from many Canadian manufacturers.\n* In '''Mexico''', steel I-beams are called IR and commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam in metric terms. For example, a \"IR250x33\" beam is approximately {{cvt|250|mm|in|1}} in depth (height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs approximately {{cvt|33|kg/m|lb/ft}}.<ref>IMCA Manual of Steel Construction, 5th Edition.</ref>\n* In '''India''' I-beams are designated as ISMB, ISJB, ISLB, ISWB. ISMB: Indian Standard Medium Weight Beam, ISJB: Indian Standard Junior Beams, ISLB: Indian Standard Light Weight Beams, and ISWB: Indian Standard Wide Flange Beams. Beams are designated as per respective abbreviated reference followed by the depth of section, such as for example \"ISMB 450\", where 450 is the depth of section in millimetres (mm). The dimensions of these beams are classified as per IS:808 (as per [[Bureau of Indian Standards|BIS]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n* In the '''United Kingdom''', these steel sections are commonly specified with a code consisting of the major dimension (usually the depth)-x-the minor dimension-x-the mass per metre-ending with the section type, all measurements being metric. Therefore, a 152x152x23UC would be a column section (UC = universal column) of approximately {{cvt|152|mm|in|1}} depth 152&nbsp;mm width and weighing {{cvt|23|kg/m|0}} of length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corusconstruction.com/file_source/StaticFiles/Construction/Library/BS4Sectionsbrochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215100102/http://www.corusconstruction.com/file_source/StaticFiles/Construction/Library/BS4Sectionsbrochure.pdf |archive-date=2010-02-15 |title=Structural sections |publisher=Corus Construction & Industrial |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n* In '''Australia''', these steel sections are commonly referred to as Universal Beams (UB) or Columns (UC). The designation for each is given as the approximate height of the beam, the type (beam or column) and then the unit metre rate (e.g., a 460UB67.1 is an approximately {{Cvt|460|mm|in|1}} deep universal beam that weighs {{Cvt|67.1|kg/m|0}}).<ref name=onesteel />\n\n=== American Standard Beams AISC  ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Type <br />!!

When Jacobi published his views in an article on the origin of Vedic culture in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1908), he therefore triggered off a major controversy in Indology.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn his later life, Jacobi interested himself in Poetry, Epics and Philosophy, particularly the school of Nyaya-Vaisheshika.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt is said that Jacobi was greatly influenced by Jain Philosophy and wished to be a Jain in his next life.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Honors==\nAmong the honours he received were a doctorate from the [[University of Calcutta]] where he had gone in the winter of 1913-14 to lecture on poetics, while the Jain community conferred the title Jain Darshan Divakar \u2014 Sun of the Jain doctrine \u2014 upon him.\n\n== Publications (selection) ==\n\n*''Zwei Jainastotras'' (1876)\n*''Ausgew\u00e4hlte Erz\u00e4hlungen in Maharashtri'' (i.e. Selected tales of the Maharashtri, 1886)\n*''The Computation of Hindu Dates in the Inscriptions'' (1892)\n*''Das Ramayana, Geschichte und Inhalt nebst Concordanz nach den gedruckten Rezensionen'' (1893)\n*''Compositum und Nebensatz, Studien \u00fcber die indogermanische Sprachentwicklung'' (1897)\n*''On the Antiquity of Vedic Culture'' (1908)\n*''Schriften zur indischen Poetik und \u00c4sthetik'' (i.e. Writings on Indian poetics and aesthetics, 1910)\n*''Die Entwicklung der Gottesidee bei den Indern und deren Beweise f\u00fcr das Dasein Gottes'' (i.e. The development of the Indians' idea of God and their proofs for God's existence, 1923)\n*''\u00dcber das urspr\u00fcngliche Yogasystem'' (i.e. About the original system of Yoga, 1929 / 1930)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Hermann Georg Jacobi}}\n\n{{Modern Jain writers|state=expanded}}\n{{Jainism topics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jacobi, Hermann}}\n[[Category:1850 births]]\n[[Category:1937 deaths]]\n[[Category:German Indologists]]\n[[Category:Scholars of Jainism]]\n[[Category:University of Calcutta alumni]]\n[[Category:German male non-fiction writers]]\n", "name_user": "Jinxedup13", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Jacobi"}
