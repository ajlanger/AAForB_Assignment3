It is the largest and primary city of the [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg district]] with about 88,000 inhabitants. It is situated within the ''[[Stuttgart Region]]'', and the district is part of the [[Stuttgart (region)|administrative region (''Regierungsbezirk'') of Stuttgart]].\n<!--\n==Geography== -->\n\n==Founding==\nThe area around Ludwigsburg had been a favored hunting grounds by the royal W\u00fcrttemberg family for generations before the founding of Ludwigsburg.  Although the region was wilderness, it was easily accessible by boat using the [[Neckar]] River.  In 1704 the founder of Ludwigsburg, [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], arranged for the laying of the foundation stone for Ludwigsburg Palace.  Ludwigsburg is named after the Duke Eberhard Louis' middle name, Ludwig being the German name for Louis.  Right up until his death, construction workers and craftsmen worked on what was to become one of the largest Baroque palace ensembles in Europe.  Under Eberhard Louis and his successor, Charles Eugene, the Palace served as the royal residence of W\u00fcrttemberg for a total of 28 years.  With the Palace as their ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (translated literally, \"collective work of art\") and the opulent festivals they organized, the Dukes put their unbounded power on display with no consideration for the finances of W\u00fcrttemberg.  To them, their most important task was to bring fame and renown to the court of W\u00fcrttemberg and to compete with and outdo other European rulers in this regard.\n\nDuke Eberhard Louis planned to found an ideal Baroque city right beside Ludwigsburg Palace.  From 1709 onwards, he tried to attract new residents to the city with a series of incentives: first he promised free plots of land and free building materials as well as fifteen years tax-free status, and later on he added freedom to practice one's profession and religion to the list.  However, the town only began to grow when it was granted city status in 1718 and then in that year became the royal residence and capital city of the country of W\u00fcrttemberg.  By the time of Eberhard Louis' death in 1733, the population had risen to around 6,000 people, which was more than half as big as the former capital city Stuttgart.  Nevertheless, the new capital city Ludwigsburg was still a major construction site with many unpaved streets and half-finished buildings.\n\nFor over two decades, Eberhard Louis (1676-1733) held court in Ludwigsburg with his mistress Wilhilmine von Gr\u00e4venitz (1684-1744) while the Duchess Johanna Elisabeth (1680-1757) remained in Stuttgart.  The clever, ambitious mistress made the best of her time, influencing politics in W\u00fcrttemberg and advancing her status in society.  When it became clear that the seriously ill heir to the throne would not come to power, Eberhard Louis had a change of heart, split with his lover and reconciled with his wife in the hope that he would have another son.  This was cause for great joy for many people in W\u00fcrttemberg, as the Protestant population feared that power would fall into the hands of the Catholic side of the royal house.  To mark reconciliation, the Ludwigsburg citizenry published a leaflet with a copper etching that made reference to the general wish for a new heir to the throne.  The etching depicts the personification of Ludwigsburg who is receiving a pearl, a symbol of fertility, from the hand of God.  However, people's hopes for another child were not fulfilled as Eberhard Louis died in 1733 and his Catholic cousin, [[Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], ascended to the throne.  When Charles Alexander immediately moved the capital of W\u00fcrttemberg back to Stuttgart, the population of the Ludwigsburg suddenly dropped by more than half within a year.\n\n==History==\nThe middle of Neckarland, where Ludwigsburg lies, was settled in the [[Stone age|stone]] and [[bronze age]]s. Numerous [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] remain in the city and surrounding area.<ref>Hans-Peter Stika.

Accessed March 4, 2010</ref> \n\nTowards the end of the 1st century, the area was occupied by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. They pushed the [[Upper Germanic Limes|Limes]] further to the east around 150 and controlled the region until 260, when the [[Alamanni]] occupied the Neckarland. Evidence of the Alamanni settlement can be found in grave sites in the city today.\n[[File:Ludwigsburg Palace December 2018 IMG 0846.jpg|right|thumb|250px|View of the upper grounds of Ludwigsburg Palace]]\n[[File:JagdschlossFavorite.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Favorite]] hunting lodge]]\n[[File:SchlossMonrepos.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Monrepos Palace]]]]\n\nThe origins of Ludwigsburg date from the beginning of the 18th century (1718\u20131723) when the largest [[baroque]] [[castle]] in Germany, [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] was built by [[Duke]] [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Ludwig]] von [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Originally, the Duke planned to just build one country home (albeit a [[palace]]), which he began building in 1704.  However, the examples of other [[F\u00fcrst|princes]] fostered a desire to project his [[political absolutism|absolutist]] power by establishing a city. To the baroque palace, he added a hunting lodge and country seat, called ''[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Schloss Favorite]]'' (1713\u20131728), and the ''Seeschloss'' (castle on the lake) ''[[Monrepos Palace|Monrepos]]'' (1764\u20131768).<ref>[http://www.schloss-ludwigsburg.de/en/ludwigsburg-palace/Home/267924.html Official website of the Ludwigsburg Palace]</ref>\n\nA settlement began near the palace in 1709 and  a town charter was granted on 3 April 1718. That same year, Ludwigsburg became a bailiff's seat, which eventually became the rural district of Ludwigsburg in 1938.\n\nIn the years between 1730 and 1800, the royal seat of residence changed back and forth several times between Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. In 1800, W\u00fcrttemberg was occupied by France under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and was forced into an alliance. In 1806, the ''[[prince-elector|Kurf\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince-Elector) Friedrich was made king of W\u00fcrttemberg by Napoleon. In 1812, the W\u00fcrttembergish army was raised in Ludwigsburg for Napoleon's Russian campaign. Of the 15,800 W\u00fcrttemberg soldiers who served, just a few hundred returned.\n\nIn 1921, Ludwigsburg became the largest garrison in southwest Germany. In 1945, Ludwigsburg was made a \"Kreisstadt\" (urban district), and later, when the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg municipal code took effect on 1 April 1956, the city was named a major urban district. In 1956 the tradition of the German garrison town was taken up again by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', Germany's federal armed forces.\n\n2004 was the 300th birthday of ''Residenzschloss'' Ludwigsburg, celebrated by the opening of the Baroque Gallery and the Ceramic Museum in the ''Residenzschloss''.\n\n==Jews and World War II==\nJewish families began living in Ludwigsburg during the 19th century and in 1884, a synagogue was built on Solitudestra\u00dfe. The synagogue was later destroyed by storm troopers during [[Kristallnacht]], the pogrom of November 1938.<ref>[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/ludwigsburg_synagoge.htm#Ludwigsburg Jewish History of Ludwigsburg] Official website of Alemania Judaica.

There were 1500 deaths.\nIt was the home of the [[prisoner-of-war camp]] [[Stalag V-A]] from October 1939 till April 1945.  After the war, there was a large [[displaced persons camp]] which housed several thousand mainly [[Poland|Polish]] displaced persons until about 1948. After 1945 until the middle of 1946, there was also an allied internment camp for war criminals in Ludwigsburg and the [[U.S. Army]] maintained the [[Pattonville|Pattonville barracks]] on the edge of town, large enough to have its own American high school.

It is the largest and primary city of the [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg district]] with about 88,000 inhabitants. It is situated within the ''[[Stuttgart Region]]'', and the district is part of the [[Stuttgart (region)|administrative region (''Regierungsbezirk'') of Stuttgart]].\n<!--\n==Geography== -->\n\n==Founding==\nThe area around Ludwigsburg had been a favored hunting grounds by the royal W\u00fcrttemberg family for generations before the founding of Ludwigsburg.  Although the region was wilderness, it was easily accessible by boat using the [[Neckar]] River.  In 1704 the founder of Ludwigsburg, [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], arranged for the laying of the foundation stone for Ludwigsburg Palace.  Ludwigsburg is named after the Duke Eberhard Louis' middle name, Ludwig being the German name for Louis.  Right up until his death, construction workers and craftsmen worked on what was to become one of the largest Baroque palace ensembles in Europe.  Under Eberhard Louis and his successor, Charles Eugene, the Palace served as the royal residence of W\u00fcrttemberg for a total of 28 years.  With the Palace as their ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (translated literally, \"collective work of art\") and the opulent festivals they organized, the Dukes put their unbounded power on display with no consideration for the finances of W\u00fcrttemberg.  To them, their most important task was to bring fame and renown to the court of W\u00fcrttemberg and to compete with and outdo other European rulers in this regard.\n\nDuke Eberhard Louis planned to found an ideal Baroque city right beside Ludwigsburg Palace.  From 1709 onwards, he tried to attract new residents to the city with a series of incentives: first he promised free plots of land and free building materials as well as fifteen years tax-free status, and later on he added freedom to practice one's profession and religion to the list.  However, the town only began to grow when it was granted city status in 1718 and then in that year became the royal residence and capital city of the country of W\u00fcrttemberg.  By the time of Eberhard Louis' death in 1733, the population had risen to around 6,000 people, which was more than half as big as the former capital city Stuttgart.  Nevertheless, the new capital city Ludwigsburg was still a major construction site with many unpaved streets and half-finished buildings.\n\nFor over two decades, Eberhard Louis (1676-1733) held court in Ludwigsburg with his mistress Wilhilmine von Gr\u00e4venitz (1684-1744) while the Duchess Johanna Elisabeth (1680-1757) remained in Stuttgart.  The clever, ambitious mistress made the best of her time, influencing politics in W\u00fcrttemberg and advancing her status in society.  When it became clear that the seriously ill heir to the throne would not come to power, Eberhard Louis had a change of heart, split with his lover and reconciled with his wife in the hope that he would have another son.  This was cause for great joy for many people in W\u00fcrttemberg, as the Protestant population feared that power would fall into the hands of the Catholic side of the royal house.  To mark reconciliation, the Ludwigsburg citizenry published a leaflet with a copper etching that made reference to the general wish for a new heir to the throne.  The etching depicts the personification of Ludwigsburg who is receiving a pearl, a symbol of fertility, from the hand of God.  However, people's hopes for another child were not fulfilled as Eberhard Louis died in 1733 and his Catholic cousin, [[Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], ascended to the throne.  When Charles Alexander immediately moved the capital of W\u00fcrttemberg back to Stuttgart, the population of the Ludwigsburg suddenly dropped by more than half within a year.\n\n==History==\nThe middle of Neckarland, where Ludwigsburg lies, was settled in the [[Stone age|stone]] and [[bronze age]]s. Numerous [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] remain in the city and surrounding area.<ref>Hans-Peter Stika.

They pushed the [[Upper Germanic Limes|Limes]] further to the east around 150 and controlled the region until 260, when the [[Alamanni]] occupied the Neckarland. Evidence of the Alamanni settlement can be found in grave sites in the city today.\n[[File:Ludwigsburg Palace December 2018 IMG 0846.jpg|right|thumb|250px|View of the upper grounds of Ludwigsburg Palace]]\n[[File:JagdschlossFavorite.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Favorite]] hunting lodge]]\n[[File:SchlossMonrepos.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Monrepos Palace]]]]\n\nThe origins of Ludwigsburg date from the beginning of the 18th century (1718\u20131723) when the largest [[baroque]] [[castle]] in Germany, [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] was built by [[Duke]] [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Ludwig]] von [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Originally, the Duke planned to just build one country home (albeit a [[palace]]), which he began building in 1704.  However, the examples of other [[F\u00fcrst|princes]] fostered a desire to project his [[political absolutism|absolutist]] power by establishing a city. To the baroque palace, he added a hunting lodge and country seat, called ''[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Schloss Favorite]]'' (1713\u20131728), and the ''Seeschloss'' (castle on the lake) ''[[Monrepos Palace|Monrepos]]'' (1764\u20131768).<ref>[http://www.schloss-ludwigsburg.de/en/ludwigsburg-palace/Home/267924.html Official website of the Ludwigsburg Palace]</ref>\n\nA settlement began near the palace in 1709 and  a town charter was granted on 3 April 1718. That same year, Ludwigsburg became a bailiff's seat, which eventually became the rural district of Ludwigsburg in 1938.\n\nIn the years between 1730 and 1800, the royal seat of residence changed back and forth several times between Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. In 1800, W\u00fcrttemberg was occupied by France under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and was forced into an alliance. In 1806, the ''[[prince-elector|Kurf\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince-Elector) Friedrich was made king of W\u00fcrttemberg by Napoleon. In 1812, the W\u00fcrttembergish army was raised in Ludwigsburg for Napoleon's Russian campaign. Of the 15,800 W\u00fcrttemberg soldiers who served, just a few hundred returned.\n\nIn 1921, Ludwigsburg became the largest garrison in southwest Germany. In 1945, Ludwigsburg was made a \"Kreisstadt\" (urban district), and later, when the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg municipal code took effect on 1 April 1956, the city was named a major urban district. In 1956 the tradition of the German garrison town was taken up again by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', Germany's federal armed forces.\n\n2004 was the 300th birthday of ''Residenzschloss'' Ludwigsburg, celebrated by the opening of the Baroque Gallery and the Ceramic Museum in the ''Residenzschloss''.\n\n==Jews and World War II==\nJewish families began living in Ludwigsburg during the 19th century and in 1884, a synagogue was built on Solitudestra\u00dfe. The synagogue was later destroyed by storm troopers during [[Kristallnacht]], the pogrom of November 1938.<ref>[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/ludwigsburg_synagoge.htm#Ludwigsburg Jewish History of Ludwigsburg] Official website of Alemania Judaica.
