Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The forces were divided into three [[presidency armies]]: [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]], [[Madras Presidency|Madras]], and [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]]. The [[Bengal Army]] recruited higher [[Caste system in India|castes]], such as [[Rajput]]s and [[Bhumihar]], mostly from the [[Awadh]] and [[Bengal]] regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the [[Madras Army]] and [[Bombay Army]] were \"more localized, caste-neutral armies\" that \"did not prefer high-caste men\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Mazumder|first=Rajit K.|title=The Indian Army and the Making of the Punjab|pages=7\u20138|year=2003|location=Delhi|publisher=Permanent Black|isbn=978-81-7824-059-6}}</ref> The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.\n\n[[File:Two Seapoy Officers; A Private Seapoy.jpg|thumb|upright|Two sepoy officers; a private sepoy, 1820s]]\n\nIn 1772, when [[Warren Hastings]] was appointed India's first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal \u2013 many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar \u2013 were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bengal, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the Company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered [[Kala pani (taboo)|polluting]] to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. \"This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=61}}</ref>  Stokes argues that \"The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the village community which remained largely intact.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eric Stokes |author-link1=Eric Thomas Stokes |date=February 1973 |title=The first century of British colonial rule in India: social revolution or social stagnation? |url= |journal=Past & Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=58 |issue=58 |pages=136\u2013160 |doi= 10.1093/past/58.1.136|jstor=650259}}</ref>\n\nAfter the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about.<ref name=brownp88>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=88}}</ref> Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the Company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|1990|p=48}}</ref>  Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and [[William Wilberforce]] had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys' allegiance was affected by this.<ref name=brownp88/>\n\nHowever, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India Company's jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less familiar regions, such as in [[Burma]], but also to make do without the \"foreign service\" remuneration that had previously been their due.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=171}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nA major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] saw this as an anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six \"General Service\" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea, and [[China]] had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into effect by [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]], Dalhousie's successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service.

The rebels consisted of three groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords called ''[[Talukdar|taluqdars]]'', and the peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], which refused to recognise the adopted children of princes as legal heirs, felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was recognised as her late husband's heir.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=72\u201373}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref> In other areas of central India, such as [[Indore]] and [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Saugar]], where such loss of privilege had not occurred, the princes remained loyal to the Company, even in areas where the sepoys had rebelled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}</ref> The second group, the ''taluqdars'', had lost half their landed estates to peasant farmers as a result of the land reforms that came in the wake of annexation of [[Oudh]]. As the rebellion gained ground, the ''taluqdars'' quickly reoccupied the lands they had lost, and paradoxically, in part because of ties of kinship and feudal loyalty, did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers, many of whom joined the rebellion, to the great dismay of the British.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=102}}</ref> It has also been suggested that heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas by the British resulted in many landowning families either losing their land or going into great debt to money lenders, and providing ultimately a reason to rebel; money lenders, in addition to the Company, were particular objects of the rebels' animosity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|p=72}}, {{Harvnb|Metcalf|1991|ch=2}}, {{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=173}}</ref> The civilian rebellion was also highly uneven in its geographic distribution, even in areas of north-central India that were no longer under British control. For example, the relatively prosperous [[Muzaffarnagar]] district, a beneficiary of a Company irrigation scheme, and next door to [[Meerut]], where the upheaval began, stayed relatively calm throughout.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\n<Center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning - Project Gutenberg eText 16528.jpg|[[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Charles Canning]], the [[Governor-General of India]] during the rebellion.\nFile:Dalhousie.jpg|[[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\nFile:Rani of jhansi.jpg|[[Rani of Jhansi|Lakshmibai, the Rani of Maratha-ruled Jhansi]], one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\nFile:Bahadur Shah II of India.jpg|[[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India, by the Indian troops, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n</gallery>\n</Center>\n\n\"[[Utilitarian]] and [[Evangelism|evangelical]]-inspired social reform\",<ref>Susanne Hoeber Rudolph, Lloyd I.

Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units<ref>{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|page=54|title=The Indian Army|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|year=1981|isbn=978-0713710748}}</ref> within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. The [[sepoy]]s were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning [[Brahmin]]s and [[Rajput]]s of the [[Bihar]] and [[Awadh]] regions. These soldiers were known as [[Purbiya]]s. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.<ref>Seema Alavi ''The Sepoys and the Company'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1998, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after [[Awadh]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (''batta'' or ''bhatta'') for service there, because they were no longer considered \"foreign missions\". The junior European officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors.  In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the Company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well.<ref>{{cite book|first=Saul|last=David|page=24|title=The Indian Mutiny|isbn=978-0-141-00554-6|date=2003-09-04}}</ref> A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.<ref>{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=243|title=A Matter of Honour|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n==Onset of the Rebellion==\n[[File:Indian Mutiny Map Showing Position of Troops on 1st May 1857.jpg|300px|thumb|Indian mutiny map showing position of troops on 1 May 1857]]\nSeveral months of increasing tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion. On 26 February 1857 the 19th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] (BNI) regiment became concerned that new cartridges they had been issued were wrapped in paper greased with cow and pig fat, which had to be opened by mouth thus affecting their religious sensibilities. Their Colonel confronted them supported by artillery and cavalry on the parade ground, but after some negotiation withdrew the artillery, and cancelled the next morning's parade.<ref>Memorandum from Lieutenant-Colonel W.

Informed about Pandey's behaviour Sergeant-Major James Hewson went to investigate, only to have Pandey shoot at him. Hewson raised the alarm.<ref name=\"David 2003 69\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=69}}</ref> When his [[adjutant]] Lt.

Publishers, New Delhi.</ref>\n\nGeneral John Hearsey came out to the parade ground to investigate, and claimed later that Mangal Pandey was in some kind of \"religious frenzy\". He ordered the Indian commander of the [[quarter guard]] [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey, but the Jemadar refused.  The quarter guard and other sepoys present, with the single exception of a soldier called [[Shaikh Paltu]], drew back from restraining or arresting Mangal Pandey.  Shaikh Paltu restrained Pandey from continuing his attack.<ref name=\"Malleson\"/><ref>Durendra Nath Sen, p. 50 ''Eighteen Fifty-Seven'', The Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India, May 1957.</ref>\n\nAfter failing to incite his comrades into an open and active rebellion, Mangal Pandey tried to take his own life, by placing his musket to his chest and pulling the trigger with his toe.  He managed only to wound himself. He was court-martialled on 6 April, and hanged two days later.\n\nThe Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was sentenced to death and hanged on 22 April.  The regiment was disbanded and stripped of its uniforms because it was felt that it harboured ill-feelings towards its superiors, particularly after this incident.  Shaikh Paltu was promoted to the rank of [[havildar]] in the Bengal Army, but was murdered shortly before the 34th BNI dispersed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kim A. |last=Wagner|page=97|title=The Great Fear of 1857.

The demonstration of disgrace during the formal disbanding helped foment the rebellion in view of some historians. Disgruntled ex-sepoys returned home to Awadh with a desire for revenge.\n\n===Unrest during April 1857===\nDuring April, there was unrest and fires at [[Agra]], [[Allahabad]] and [[Ambala]]. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General's staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to [[Shimla|Simla]], the cool \"hill station\" where many high officials spent the summer.\n\nAlthough there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings (especially those belonging to soldiers who had used the Enfield cartridges) and European officers' bungalows were set on fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\n===Meerut===\n[[File:The Sepoy revolt at Meerut.jpg|thumb|\"The Sepoy revolt at Meerut,\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857]]\n[[File:1857 mutineers mosque meerut2.jpg|thumb|An 1858 photograph by [[Felice Beato]] of a mosque in Meerut where some of the rebel soldiers may have prayed]]\n\nAt [[Meerut]], a large military cantonment, 2,357 Indian sepoys and 2,038 British soldiers were stationed along with 12 British-manned guns. The station held one of the largest concentrations of British troops in India and this was later to be cited as evidence that the original rising was a spontaneous outbreak rather than a pre-planned plot.<ref name=Mason278>{{Citation|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=278|title=A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the state of unrest within the Bengal Army was well known, on 24 April Lieutenant Colonel George Carmichael-Smyth, the unsympathetic commanding officer of the [[3rd Bengal Light Cavalry]], ordered 90 of his men to parade and perform firing drills. All except five of the men on parade refused to accept their cartridges. On 9 May, the remaining 85 men were [[court martial]]led, and most were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment with hard labour. Eleven comparatively young soldiers were given five years' imprisonment. The entire garrison was paraded and watched as the condemned men were stripped of their uniforms and placed in shackles. As they were marched off to jail, the condemned soldiers berated their comrades for failing to support them.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. Some Indian soldiers warned off-duty junior European officers that plans were afoot to release the imprisoned soldiers by force, but the senior officers to whom this was reported took no action. There was also unrest in the city of Meerut itself, with angry protests in the bazaar and some buildings being set on fire. In the evening, most European officers were preparing to attend church, while many of the European soldiers were off duty and had gone into canteens or into the bazaar in Meerut. The Indian troops, led by the 3rd Cavalry, broke into revolt. European junior officers who attempted to quell the first outbreaks were killed by the rebels. European officers' and civilians' quarters were attacked, and four civilian men, eight women and eight children were killed. Crowds in the bazaar attacked off-duty soldiers there. About 50 Indian civilians, some of them officers' servants who tried to defend or conceal their employers, were killed by the sepoys.<ref name=\"David 2003 93\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=93}}</ref> While the action of the sepoys in freeing their 85 imprisoned comrades appears to have been spontaneous, some civilian rioting in the city was reportedly encouraged by [[kotwal]] (local police commander) [[Dhan Singh Gurjar]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=80\u201385}}</ref>\n\nSome sepoys (especially from the 11th Bengal Native Infantry) escorted trusted British officers and women and children to safety before joining the revolt.<ref>Sir John Kaye & G. B. Malleson: ''The Indian Mutiny of 1857'', (Delhi: Rupa & Co.) reprint 2005, p. 49.</ref> Some officers and their families escaped to [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], where they found refuge with the Nawab.\n\nThe British historian Philip Mason notes that it was inevitable that most of the sepoys and sowars from Meerut should have made for Delhi on the night of 10 May. It was a strong walled city located only forty miles away, it was the ancient capital and present seat of the nominal Mughal Emperor and finally there were no British troops in garrison there in contrast to Meerut.<ref name=Mason278/> No effort was made to pursue them.\n\n===Delhi===\n[[File:Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi,.jpg|thumb|Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi]]\n\nEarly on 11 May, the first parties of the 3rd Cavalry reached Delhi. From beneath the windows of the King's apartments in the palace, they called on him to acknowledge and lead them. [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah]] did nothing at this point, apparently treating the sepoys as ordinary petitioners, but others in the palace were quick to join the revolt.  During the day, the revolt spread.  European officials and dependents, Indian Christians and shop keepers within the city were killed, some by sepoys and others by crowds of rioters.<ref>Dr. Surendra Nath Sen, pages 71\u201373 \"Eighteen Fifty-Seven\", Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India.</ref>\n\n[[File:1858 Delhi flag tower.jpg|thumb|The [[Flagstaff Tower]], Delhi, where the European survivors of the rebellion gathered on 11 May 1857; photographed by [[Felice Beato]]]]\n\nThere were three battalion-sized regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in or near the city. Some detachments quickly joined the rebellion, while others held back but also refused to obey orders to take action against the rebels. In the afternoon, a violent explosion in the city was heard for several miles. Fearing that the arsenal, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition, would fall intact into rebel hands, the nine British Ordnance officers there had opened fire on the sepoys, including the men of their own guard. When resistance appeared hopeless, they blew up the arsenal. Six of the nine officers survived, but the blast killed many in the streets and nearby houses and other buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=98\u2013101}}</ref> The news of these events finally tipped the sepoys stationed around Delhi into open rebellion.  The sepoys were later able to salvage at least some arms from the arsenal, and a magazine two miles (3&nbsp;km) outside Delhi, containing up to 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, was captured without resistance.\n\nMany fugitive European officers and civilians had congregated at the [[Flagstaff Tower]] on the ridge north of Delhi, where telegraph operators were sending news of the events to other British stations.  When it became clear that the help expected from Meerut was not coming, they made their way in carriages to [[Karnal]].  Those who became separated from the main body or who could not reach the Flagstaff Tower also set out for Karnal on foot. Some were helped by villagers on the way; others were killed.\n\nThe next day, Bahadur Shah held his first formal court for many years. It was attended by many excited sepoys. The King was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys' allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 Europeans who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed by some of the King's servants under a [[peepul tree]] in a courtyard outside the palace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=93\u201395}}</ref><ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Moghul'', pp. 223\u2013224.</ref>\n\n==Supporters and opposition==\n[[File:Indian revolt of 1857 states map.svg|thumb|250px|States during the rebellion]]\n\nThe news of the events at [[Meerut]] and [[Delhi]] spread rapidly, provoking uprisings among sepoys and disturbances in many districts. In many cases, it was the behaviour of British military and civilian authorities themselves which precipitated disorder. Learning of the fall of Delhi, many Company administrators hastened to remove themselves, their families and servants to places of safety.

Firstly, many Sikhs resented that Hindustanis/[[Purbiya]]s in service of the Sikh state had been foremost in urging the wars, which lost them their independence. Sikh soldiers also recalled that the bloodiest battles of the war, [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] and [[Battle of Ferozeshah|Ferozeshah]], were won by British troops, and they believed that the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet them in battle. These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit-making civil posts in Punjab.<ref name=Kennedy216/>\n\nIn 1857, the Bengal Army had 86,000 men, of which 12,000 were European, 16,000 Sikh and 1,500 Gurkha.

In total, only twelve of the original Bengal Native Infantry regiments survived to pass into the new Indian Army.<ref>''Indian Army Uniforms under the British \u2013 Infantry'', W. Y.

Of these, a substantial contingent from the recently annexed state of Awadh mutinied ''en masse''. Another large contingent from Gwalior also mutinied, even though that state's ruler supported the British. The remainder of the irregular units were raised from a wide variety of sources and were less affected by the concerns of mainstream Indian society. Some irregular units actively supported the Company: three Gurkha and five of six Sikh infantry units, and the six infantry and six cavalry units of the recently raised Punjab Irregular Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/august/sepoy.htm|title=The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857\u201359 \u2013 A.

When European troops were reinforced and began to counterattack, the mutineers were especially handicapped by their lack of centralized command and control. Although the rebels produced some natural leaders such as [[Bakht Khan]], whom the Emperor later nominated as commander-in-chief after his son [[Mirza Mughal]] proved ineffectual, for the most part they were forced to look for leadership to rajahs and princes.

The siege lasted roughly from 1 July to 21 September. However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the Company forces were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the Company forces to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the [[Punjab Movable Column]] of British, Sikh and Pakhtun soldiers under [[John Nicholson (general)|John Nicholson]] to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/10/28/stories/2006102801590100.htm God's Acre].

He had relied on his own prestige, and his cordial relations with the [[Nana Sahib]] to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition.\n\nThe besieged endured three weeks of the [[Siege of Cawnpore]] with little water or food, suffering continuous casualties to men, women and children.  On 25 June Nana Sahib made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad.  With barely three days' food rations remaining, the British agreed provided they could keep their small arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the night of the 26th).  Early in the morning of 27 June, the European party left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to [[Allahabad]].<ref>''The story of Cawnpore: The Indian Mutiny 1857'', Capt.

That very moment someone from the crowd blew a loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the boatmen jumped off the boats.  The rebels started shooting indiscriminately.

With Company forces approaching Cawnpore and some believing that they would not advance if there were no hostages to save, their murders were ordered.

Other historians have suggested that the killings were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib's relationship with the British.<ref name=autogenerated3>John Harris, The Indian mutiny, Wordsworth military library 2001, p. 92.</ref> Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1857 hospital wheeler cawnpore2.jpg|Photograph entitled, \"The Hospital in General Wheeler's entrenchment, Cawnpore\".

Albumen silver print by [[Felice Beato]], 1858]]\n\nVery soon after the events at [[Meerut]], rebellion erupted in the state of [[Awadh]] (also known as Oudh, in modern-day [[Uttar Pradesh]]), which had been annexed barely a year before. The British Commissioner resident at [[Lucknow]], [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Sir Henry Lawrence]], had enough time to fortify his position inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys, numbered some 1700 men. The rebels' assaults were unsuccessful, so they began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by [[John Eardley Inglis]]. The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via tunnels that led to underground close combat.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|486}} After 90 days of siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British soldiers and 550 non-combatants.\n\nOn 25 September, a relief column under the command of [[Sir Henry Havelock]] and accompanied by [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|Sir James Outram]] (who in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as 'The First Relief of Lucknow', as this force was not strong enough to break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the garrison. In October, another larger army under the new Commander-in-Chief, [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], was finally able to relieve the garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an orderly withdrawal, firstly to [[Alambagh]] {{convert|4|mi|km}} north where a force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]].\n\nIn March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh. He was aided by a large [[Nepal]]ese contingent advancing from the north under [[Jung Bahadur Kunwar Rana]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=358, 428}}</ref> General [[Dhir Shamsher Rana|Dhir Shamsher Kunwar Rana]], the youngest brother of Jung Bahadur, also led the Nepalese forces in various parts of India including [[Lucknow]], [[Benares]] and [[Patna]].<ref name=\"Tyagi1974\">{{cite book | first = Sushila |last= Tyagi | title = Indo-Nepalese Relations: (1858 - 1914) | publisher = Concept Publishing Company | location = India | year = 1974 | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com.np/books?id=O0aOlkayZnQC }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Shreeram Prasad | last= Upadhyay | title = Indo-Nepal trade relations: a historical analysis of Nepal's trade with the British India | publisher = Nirala Publications | location = India | year =1992 | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com.np/books?id=o_oVAQAAMAAJ }}</ref> Campbell's advance was slow and methodical, with a force under [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|General Outram]] crossing the river on cask bridges on 4 March to enable them to fire artillery in flank.

When the Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed to the [[British Raj]] by the [[Governor-General of India]] under the [[doctrine of lapse]]. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the [[Rani of Jhansi]], protested against the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company officials and their families took refuge in [[Jhansi Fort]], and the Rani negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the Europeans suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials.\n\nBy the end of June 1857, the Company had lost control of much of [[Bundelkhand]] and eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled, marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves. In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of [[Datia]] and [[Orchha]].\n\nOn 3 February, Sir [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Hugh Rose]] broke the 3-month siege of Saugor. Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them from rebel occupation.<ref>Essential Histories, the Indian Mutiny 1857\u201358, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, Osprey 2007, p. 79.</ref>\n\nIn March 1858, the Central India Field Force, led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise.\n\nAfter being driven from Jhansi and [[Kalpi]], on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of [[Gwalior]] from the [[Scindia]] rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the rebellion but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars]] according to the account of three independent Indian representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was compared to [[Joan of Arc]] by some commentators.<ref>Lachmi Bai Rani of Jhansi, the Jeanne d'Arc of India (1901), White, Michael (Michael Alfred Edwin), 1866, New York: J.F.

It included not only the present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan.\n\nMuch of the region had been the [[Sikh Empire]], ruled by [[Ranjit Singh]] until his death in 1839. The kingdom had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the [[Khalsa]] (the Sikh army) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both European and Indian troops.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably [[Ferozepore]], indecision on the part of the senior European officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi.<ref name=\"Project Gutenberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg}}</ref> At the most important garrison, that of [[Peshawar]] close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, [[Thomas Reed (British Army officer)|General Reed]], and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the \"Punjab Movable Column\" to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May.

At Fatehgarh, for example, when the English defeated the enemy, their officers ordered a mass scale killing [of] the rebels and the citizens on the spot. General Neill had also ordered Hanging parties.... No evidence was sought and none given before executing the victim.... When the [78th] Highlanders moved to another village, they caught about 140 men, women and children. They selected sixty men from the group, forced them to build the gallows of wooden logs taken from the burning homes. They then chose ten men of the group [and] hanged them without any evidence or trial. For others, they had reserved flogging and beating to teach them a lesson..... At one of the villages, about two thousand villagers armed only with their lathis [wooden canes] turned out in protest. They stood up to face the [78th] Highlanders. The British troops surrounded them and set their village on fire.... The villagers trying to escape were shot to death. One soldier describes the incident thus: 'We took eighteen of them prisoners; they were all tied together, and we fired a volley at them and shot them on the spot' .... Stringing and shooting the men in front of their family was a sport the troops enjoyed. Watching women stooping and begging for the lives of their men seemed to thrill the young soldiers and their officers. The prisoners were made to stand under the hot summer sun for hours till they fainted. It was easy to flog them when they were half-conscious, otherwise, they would squirm and make it hard to strike.

In August, by the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the company was formally dissolved and its ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890\u20131923 |accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref> A new British government department, the [[India Office]], was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the [[Secretary of State for India]], was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, [[Viceroy of India]], and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the [[Straits Settlements]], became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at [[Westernization]]. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.\n\nEssentially the old East India Company bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by the Company to introduce free market competition had undermined traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at the mercy of merchants and money-lenders. In consequence the new [[British Raj]] was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a preservation of tradition and hierarchy.\n\nOn a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the creation of a new 'white collar' Indian elite, further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1858, in which it is expressly stated, \"We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity, duly to discharge.\"\n\nActing on these sentiments, [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]], viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the [[Ilbert Bill]]. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a [[white mutiny]] and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In 1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil service.\n\n===Military reorganisation===\n[[File:Captain C Scott of the Gen. Sir. Hope Grant's Column, Sepoy Mutiny, 1857.

Metcalf says Stokes undermines the assumption that 1857 was a response to general causes emanating from entire classes of people.  Instead, Stokes argues that 1) those Indians who suffered the greatest relative deprivation rebelled and that 2) the decisive factor in precipitating a revolt was the presence of prosperous magnates who supported British rule.  Stokes also explores issues of economic development, the nature of privileged landholding, the role of moneylenders, the usefulness of classical rent theory, and, especially, the notion of the \"rich peasant\".<ref>Thomas R.

Speaking in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in July 1857, [[Benjamin Disraeli]] labelled it a 'national revolt' while [[Lord Palmerston]], the Prime Minister, tried to downplay the scope and the significance of the event as a 'mere military mutiny'.<ref>''The Indian Mutiny and Victorian Trauma'' by Christopher Herbert, Princeton University Press, Princeton 2007.</ref> Reflecting this debate, an early historian of the rebellion, Charles Ball, used the word mutiny in his title, but labelled it a \"struggle for liberty and independence as a people\" in the text.<ref>''The History of the Indian Mutiny: Giving a detailed account of the sepoy insurrection in India'' by Charles Ball, The London Printing and Publishing Company, London, 1860.</ref> Historians remain divided on whether the rebellion can properly be considered a war of Indian independence or not,<ref>V.D. Savarkar argues that the rebellion was a war of Indian independence. ''The Indian War of Independence: 1857'' (Bombay: 1947 [1909]). Most historians have seen his arguments as discredited, with one venturing so far as to say, 'It was neither first, nor national, nor a war of independence.' Eric Stokes has argued that the rebellion was actually a variety of movements, not one movement. ''The Peasant Armed'' (Oxford: 1980). See also S. B. Chaudhuri, ''Civil Rebellion in the Indian Mutinies 1857\u20131859'' (Calcutta: 1957).</ref> although it is popularly considered to be one in India. Arguments against include:\n* A united India did not exist at that time in political, cultural, or ethnic terms;\n* The rebellion was put down with the help of other Indian soldiers drawn from the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Sikh regiments; 80% of the East India Company forces were Indian;<ref>The Indian Mutiny, Spilsbury Julian, Orion, 2007.</ref>\n* Many of the local rulers fought amongst themselves rather than uniting against the British;\n* Many rebel Sepoy regiments disbanded and went home rather than fight;\n* Not all of the rebels accepted the return of the Mughals;\n* The King of Delhi had no real control over the mutineers;<ref>S&T magazine issue 121 (September 1988), p. 20.</ref>\n* The revolt was largely limited to north and central India. Whilst risings occurred elsewhere they had little impact because of their limited nature;\n* A number of revolts occurred in areas not under British rule, and against native rulers, often as a result of local internal politics;\n* \"The revolt was fractured along religious, ethnic and regional lines.<ref>The communal hatred led to ugly communal riots in many parts of U.P. The green flag was hoisted and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor, Moradabad, and other places the Muslims shouted for the revival of Muslim kingdom.\" [[R. C.

Albumen silver print by [[Felice Beato]], 1857.]]\nA second school of thought while acknowledging the validity of the above-mentioned arguments opines that this rebellion may indeed be called a war of India's independence. The reasons advanced are:\n* Even though the rebellion had various causes, most of the rebel sepoys who were able to do so, made their way to Delhi to revive the old [[Mughal empire]] that signified national unity for even the Hindus amongst them;\n* There was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as [[Awadh]], [[Bundelkhand]] and [[Rohilkhand]]. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region;\n* The sepoys did not seek to revive small kingdoms in their regions, instead they repeatedly proclaimed a \"country-wide rule\" of the Mughals and vowed to drive out the British from \"India\", as they knew it then. (The sepoys ignored local princes and proclaimed in cities they took over: ''Khalq Khuda Ki, Mulk Badshah Ka, Hukm Subahdar Sipahi Bahadur Ka'' \u2013 \"the people belong to God, the country to the Emperor and authority to the Sepoy Commandant\"). The objective of driving out \"foreigners\" from not only one's own area but from their conception of the entirety of \"India\", signifies a nationalist sentiment;\n* The mutineers, although some were recruited from outside Oudah, displayed a common purpose.<ref>[[Sitaram Yechury]].

Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The forces were divided into three [[presidency armies]]: [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]], [[Madras Presidency|Madras]], and [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]]. The [[Bengal Army]] recruited higher [[Caste system in India|castes]], such as [[Rajput]]s and [[Bhumihar]], mostly from the [[Awadh]] and [[Bengal]] regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the [[Madras Army]] and [[Bombay Army]] were \"more localized, caste-neutral armies\" that \"did not prefer high-caste men\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Mazumder|first=Rajit K.|title=The Indian Army and the Making of the Punjab|pages=7\u20138|year=2003|location=Delhi|publisher=Permanent Black|isbn=978-81-7824-059-6}}</ref> The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.\n\n[[File:Two Seapoy Officers; A Private Seapoy.jpg|thumb|upright|Two sepoy officers; a private sepoy, 1820s]]\n\nIn 1772, when [[Warren Hastings]] was appointed India's first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal \u2013 many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar \u2013 were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bengal, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the Company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered [[Kala pani (taboo)|polluting]] to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. \"This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=61}}</ref>  Stokes argues that \"The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the village community which remained largely intact.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eric Stokes |author-link1=Eric Thomas Stokes |date=February 1973 |title=The first century of British colonial rule in India: social revolution or social stagnation? |url= |journal=Past & Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=58 |issue=58 |pages=136\u2013160 |doi= 10.1093/past/58.1.136|jstor=650259}}</ref>\n\nAfter the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about.<ref name=brownp88>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=88}}</ref> Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the Company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|1990|p=48}}</ref>  Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and [[William Wilberforce]] had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys' allegiance was affected by this.<ref name=brownp88/>\n\nHowever, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India Company's jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less familiar regions, such as in [[Burma]], but also to make do without the \"foreign service\" remuneration that had previously been their due.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=171}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nA major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] saw this as an anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six \"General Service\" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea, and [[China]] had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into effect by [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]], Dalhousie's successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually extended to them, as well as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition of family service.<ref>''A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army, its Officers and Men'', Philip Mason, {{ISBN|0-333-41837-9}}, p. 261.</ref>\n\nThere were also grievances over the issue of promotions, based on seniority.

This however, merely caused many sepoys to be convinced that the rumours were true and that their fears were justified. Additional rumours started that the paper in the new cartridges, which was glazed and stiffer than the previously used paper, was impregnated with grease.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2007|p=293}}</ref> In February, a court of inquiry was held at Barrackpore to get to the bottom of these rumours. Native soldiers called as witnesses complained of the paper \"being stiff and like cloth in the mode of tearing\", said that when the paper was burned it smelled of grease, and announced that the suspicion that the paper itself contained grease could not be removed from their minds.<ref>G.

The rebels consisted of three groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords called ''[[Talukdar|taluqdars]]'', and the peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], which refused to recognise the adopted children of princes as legal heirs, felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was recognised as her late husband's heir.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=72\u201373}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref> In other areas of central India, such as [[Indore]] and [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Saugar]], where such loss of privilege had not occurred, the princes remained loyal to the Company, even in areas where the sepoys had rebelled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}</ref> The second group, the ''taluqdars'', had lost half their landed estates to peasant farmers as a result of the land reforms that came in the wake of annexation of [[Oudh]]. As the rebellion gained ground, the ''taluqdars'' quickly reoccupied the lands they had lost, and paradoxically, in part because of ties of kinship and feudal loyalty, did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers, many of whom joined the rebellion, to the great dismay of the British.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=102}}</ref> It has also been suggested that heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas by the British resulted in many landowning families either losing their land or going into great debt to money lenders, and providing ultimately a reason to rebel; money lenders, in addition to the Company, were particular objects of the rebels' animosity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|p=72}}, {{Harvnb|Metcalf|1991|ch=2}}, {{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=173}}</ref> The civilian rebellion was also highly uneven in its geographic distribution, even in areas of north-central India that were no longer under British control.

Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units<ref>{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|page=54|title=The Indian Army|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|year=1981|isbn=978-0713710748}}</ref> within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. The [[sepoy]]s were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning [[Brahmin]]s and [[Rajput]]s of the [[Bihar]] and [[Awadh]] regions. These soldiers were known as [[Purbiya]]s. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.<ref>Seema Alavi ''The Sepoys and the Company'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1998, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after [[Awadh]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (''batta'' or ''bhatta'') for service there, because they were no longer considered \"foreign missions\". The junior European officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors.  In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the Company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well.<ref>{{cite book|first=Saul|last=David|page=24|title=The Indian Mutiny|isbn=978-0-141-00554-6|date=2003-09-04}}</ref> A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.<ref>{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=243|title=A Matter of Honour|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n==Onset of the Rebellion==\n[[File:Indian Mutiny Map Showing Position of Troops on 1st May 1857.jpg|300px|thumb|Indian mutiny map showing position of troops on 1 May 1857]]\nSeveral months of increasing tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion. On 26 February 1857 the 19th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] (BNI) regiment became concerned that new cartridges they had been issued were wrapped in paper greased with cow and pig fat, which had to be opened by mouth thus affecting their religious sensibilities. Their Colonel confronted them supported by artillery and cavalry on the parade ground, but after some negotiation withdrew the artillery, and cancelled the next morning's parade.<ref>Memorandum from Lieutenant-Colonel W. St. L. Mitchell (CO of the 19th BNI) to Major A. H.

Informed about Pandey's behaviour Sergeant-Major James Hewson went to investigate, only to have Pandey shoot at him. Hewson raised the alarm.<ref name=\"David 2003 69\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=69}}</ref> When his [[adjutant]] Lt.

Publishers, New Delhi.</ref>\n\nGeneral John Hearsey came out to the parade ground to investigate, and claimed later that Mangal Pandey was in some kind of \"religious frenzy\". He ordered the Indian commander of the [[quarter guard]] [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey, but the Jemadar refused.  The quarter guard and other sepoys present, with the single exception of a soldier called [[Shaikh Paltu]], drew back from restraining or arresting Mangal Pandey.  Shaikh Paltu restrained Pandey from continuing his attack.<ref name=\"Malleson\"/><ref>Durendra Nath Sen, p. 50 ''Eighteen Fifty-Seven'', The Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India, May 1957.</ref>\n\nAfter failing to incite his comrades into an open and active rebellion, Mangal Pandey tried to take his own life, by placing his musket to his chest and pulling the trigger with his toe.  He managed only to wound himself. He was court-martialled on 6 April, and hanged two days later.\n\nThe Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was sentenced to death and hanged on 22 April.  The regiment was disbanded and stripped of its uniforms because it was felt that it harboured ill-feelings towards its superiors, particularly after this incident.  Shaikh Paltu was promoted to the rank of [[havildar]] in the Bengal Army, but was murdered shortly before the 34th BNI dispersed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kim A. |last=Wagner|page=97|title=The Great Fear of 1857. Rumours, Conspiracies and the Making of the Indian Uprising|isbn=978-93-81406-34-2}}</ref>\n\nSepoys in other regiments thought these punishments were harsh. The demonstration of disgrace during the formal disbanding helped foment the rebellion in view of some historians. Disgruntled ex-sepoys returned home to Awadh with a desire for revenge.\n\n===Unrest during April 1857===\nDuring April, there was unrest and fires at [[Agra]], [[Allahabad]] and [[Ambala]]. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General's staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to [[Shimla|Simla]], the cool \"hill station\" where many high officials spent the summer.\n\nAlthough there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings (especially those belonging to soldiers who had used the Enfield cartridges) and European officers' bungalows were set on fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\n===Meerut===\n[[File:The Sepoy revolt at Meerut.jpg|thumb|\"The Sepoy revolt at Meerut,\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857]]\n[[File:1857 mutineers mosque meerut2.jpg|thumb|An 1858 photograph by [[Felice Beato]] of a mosque in Meerut where some of the rebel soldiers may have prayed]]\n\nAt [[Meerut]], a large military cantonment, 2,357 Indian sepoys and 2,038 British soldiers were stationed along with 12 British-manned guns. The station held one of the largest concentrations of British troops in India and this was later to be cited as evidence that the original rising was a spontaneous outbreak rather than a pre-planned plot.<ref name=Mason278>{{Citation|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=278|title=A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the state of unrest within the Bengal Army was well known, on 24 April Lieutenant Colonel George Carmichael-Smyth, the unsympathetic commanding officer of the [[3rd Bengal Light Cavalry]], ordered 90 of his men to parade and perform firing drills. All except five of the men on parade refused to accept their cartridges. On 9 May, the remaining 85 men were [[court martial]]led, and most were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment with hard labour. Eleven comparatively young soldiers were given five years' imprisonment. The entire garrison was paraded and watched as the condemned men were stripped of their uniforms and placed in shackles. As they were marched off to jail, the condemned soldiers berated their comrades for failing to support them.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. Some Indian soldiers warned off-duty junior European officers that plans were afoot to release the imprisoned soldiers by force, but the senior officers to whom this was reported took no action. There was also unrest in the city of Meerut itself, with angry protests in the bazaar and some buildings being set on fire. In the evening, most European officers were preparing to attend church, while many of the European soldiers were off duty and had gone into canteens or into the bazaar in Meerut. The Indian troops, led by the 3rd Cavalry, broke into revolt. European junior officers who attempted to quell the first outbreaks were killed by the rebels. European officers' and civilians' quarters were attacked, and four civilian men, eight women and eight children were killed. Crowds in the bazaar attacked off-duty soldiers there. About 50 Indian civilians, some of them officers' servants who tried to defend or conceal their employers, were killed by the sepoys.<ref name=\"David 2003 93\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=93}}</ref> While the action of the sepoys in freeing their 85 imprisoned comrades appears to have been spontaneous, some civilian rioting in the city was reportedly encouraged by [[kotwal]] (local police commander) [[Dhan Singh Gurjar]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=80\u201385}}</ref>\n\nSome sepoys (especially from the 11th Bengal Native Infantry) escorted trusted British officers and women and children to safety before joining the revolt.<ref>Sir John Kaye & G. B. Malleson: ''The Indian Mutiny of 1857'', (Delhi: Rupa & Co.) reprint 2005, p. 49.</ref> Some officers and their families escaped to [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], where they found refuge with the Nawab.\n\nThe British historian Philip Mason notes that it was inevitable that most of the sepoys and sowars from Meerut should have made for Delhi on the night of 10 May. It was a strong walled city located only forty miles away, it was the ancient capital and present seat of the nominal Mughal Emperor and finally there were no British troops in garrison there in contrast to Meerut.<ref name=Mason278/> No effort was made to pursue them.\n\n===Delhi===\n[[File:Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi,.jpg|thumb|Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi]]\n\nEarly on 11 May, the first parties of the 3rd Cavalry reached Delhi. From beneath the windows of the King's apartments in the palace, they called on him to acknowledge and lead them. [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah]] did nothing at this point, apparently treating the sepoys as ordinary petitioners, but others in the palace were quick to join the revolt.  During the day, the revolt spread.  European officials and dependents, Indian Christians and shop keepers within the city were killed, some by sepoys and others by crowds of rioters.<ref>Dr. Surendra Nath Sen, pages 71\u201373 \"Eighteen Fifty-Seven\", Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India.</ref>\n\n[[File:1858 Delhi flag tower.jpg|thumb|The [[Flagstaff Tower]], Delhi, where the European survivors of the rebellion gathered on 11 May 1857; photographed by [[Felice Beato]]]]\n\nThere were three battalion-sized regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in or near the city. Some detachments quickly joined the rebellion, while others held back but also refused to obey orders to take action against the rebels. In the afternoon, a violent explosion in the city was heard for several miles. Fearing that the arsenal, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition, would fall intact into rebel hands, the nine British Ordnance officers there had opened fire on the sepoys, including the men of their own guard. When resistance appeared hopeless, they blew up the arsenal. Six of the nine officers survived, but the blast killed many in the streets and nearby houses and other buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=98\u2013101}}</ref> The news of these events finally tipped the sepoys stationed around Delhi into open rebellion.  The sepoys were later able to salvage at least some arms from the arsenal, and a magazine two miles (3&nbsp;km) outside Delhi, containing up to 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, was captured without resistance.\n\nMany fugitive European officers and civilians had congregated at the [[Flagstaff Tower]] on the ridge north of Delhi, where telegraph operators were sending news of the events to other British stations.  When it became clear that the help expected from Meerut was not coming, they made their way in carriages to [[Karnal]].  Those who became separated from the main body or who could not reach the Flagstaff Tower also set out for Karnal on foot. Some were helped by villagers on the way; others were killed.\n\nThe next day, Bahadur Shah held his first formal court for many years. It was attended by many excited sepoys. The King was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys' allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 Europeans who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed by some of the King's servants under a [[peepul tree]] in a courtyard outside the palace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=93\u201395}}</ref><ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Moghul'', pp. 223\u2013224.</ref>\n\n==Supporters and opposition==\n[[File:Indian revolt of 1857 states map.svg|thumb|250px|States during the rebellion]]\n\nThe news of the events at [[Meerut]] and [[Delhi]] spread rapidly, provoking uprisings among sepoys and disturbances in many districts. In many cases, it was the behaviour of British military and civilian authorities themselves which precipitated disorder. Learning of the fall of Delhi, many Company administrators hastened to remove themselves, their families and servants to places of safety. At [[Agra]], {{convert|160|mi|km}} from Delhi, no less than 6,000 assorted non-combatants converged on the [[Agra Fort|Fort]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=152\u2013163}}</ref>\n\nThe military authorities also reacted in disjointed manner. Some officers trusted their sepoys, but others tried to disarm them to forestall potential uprisings. At [[Varanasi|Benares]] and [[Allahabad]], the disarmings were bungled, also leading to local revolts.<ref>Michael Edwardes, ''Battles of the Indian Mutiny'', pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\n[[File:Troops of the Native Allies.jpg|thumb|left|''Troops of the Native Allies'' by George Francklin Atkinson, 1859.]]\n\nMost Muslims did not share the rebels' dislike of the British administration<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/129 129]|quote=Nor did most Muslims share the rebels' hatred of the British, even as they deplored the more egregious excesses of colonial rule.}}</ref> and their [[ulema]] could not agree on whether to declare a jihad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/114 114]\u2013|quote=During the 1857 uprising, the ulema could not agree whether to declare a jihad.}}</ref> There were Islamic scholars such as Maulana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi|Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi]] and Maulana [[Rashid Ahmad Gangohi]] who took up arms against the colonial rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/122 122]\u2013123|quote=Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi (1833-1879), the great Deobandi scholar, fought against the British...Along with Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (1828-1905), he took up arms when he was presented with clear evidence of English injustice.}}</ref> But a large number of Muslims, among them ulema from both the Sunni and Shia sects, sided with the British.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/130 130]|quote=Many Muslims, including Sunni and Shia ulema, collaborated with the British.}}</ref> Various [[Ahl-i Hadith|Ahl-i-Hadith]] scholars and colleagues of Nanautavi rejected the jihad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/130 130]\u2013131|quote=Several of Nanautawi's fellow seminarians in Deoband and divines of the Ahl-i-Hadith reputed for their adherence to Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi rejected the jihad.}}</ref> The most influential member of Ahl-i-Hadith ulema in Delhi, Maulana [[Syed Nazeer Husain|Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehlvi]], resisted pressure from the mutineers to call for a jihad and instead declared in favour of British rule, viewing the Muslim-British relationship as a legal contract which could not be broken unless their religious rights were breached.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/131 131]|quote=Maulana Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehalvi was the most influential of the Ahl-Hadith ulema in Delhi at the time of the revolt.

He has also suggested that Sikhs felt insulted by the attitude of sepoys who, in their view, had beaten the [[Khalsa]] only with British help; they resented and despised them far more than they did the British.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2001|p=57}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Looting sikhs.jpg|thumb|''Sikh Troops Dividing the Spoil Taken from Mutineers'', circa 1860]]\n\nThe Sikhs feared reinstatement of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule in northern India<ref name=Kennedy216>{{Citation| last=Trevaskis| first=Hugh Kennedy| year=1928| title=The Land of Five Rivers: An Economic History of the Punjab from Earliest Times to the Year of Grace 1890| location=London| publisher=Oxford University Press| pages=216\u2013217}}</ref> because they had been persecuted heavily in the past by the Mughal dynasty.\n\nSikh support for the British resulted from grievances surrounding sepoys' perceived conduct during and after the [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]]. Firstly, many Sikhs resented that Hindustanis/[[Purbiya]]s in service of the Sikh state had been foremost in urging the wars, which lost them their independence. Sikh soldiers also recalled that the bloodiest battles of the war, [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] and [[Battle of Ferozeshah|Ferozeshah]], were won by British troops, and they believed that the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet them in battle. These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit-making civil posts in Punjab.<ref name=Kennedy216/>\n\nIn 1857, the Bengal Army had 86,000 men, of which 12,000 were European, 16,000 Sikh and 1,500 Gurkha.

Of these, a substantial contingent from the recently annexed state of Awadh mutinied ''en masse''. Another large contingent from Gwalior also mutinied, even though that state's ruler supported the British. The remainder of the irregular units were raised from a wide variety of sources and were less affected by the concerns of mainstream Indian society.

When European troops were reinforced and began to counterattack, the mutineers were especially handicapped by their lack of centralized command and control. Although the rebels produced some natural leaders such as [[Bakht Khan]], whom the Emperor later nominated as commander-in-chief after his son [[Mirza Mughal]] proved ineffectual, for the most part they were forced to look for leadership to rajahs and princes.

The siege lasted roughly from 1 July to 21 September. However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the Company forces were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the Company forces to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the [[Punjab Movable Column]] of British, Sikh and Pakhtun soldiers under [[John Nicholson (general)|John Nicholson]] to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/10/28/stories/2006102801590100.htm God's Acre].

A large number of the citizens were killed in retaliation for the Europeans and Indian civilians that had been slaughtered by the rebels.  During the street fighting, artillery was set up in the city's main mosque. Neighbourhoods within range were bombarded; the homes of the Muslim nobility that contained innumerable cultural, artistic, literary and monetary riches were destroyed.\n\nThe British soon arrested Bahadur Shah, and the next day the British agent [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]] had his sons [[Mirza Mughal]], Mirza Khazir Sultan, and grandson Mirza Abu Bakr shot under his own authority at the [[Khooni Darwaza]] (the bloody gate) near Delhi Gate.

Wheeler was not only a veteran and respected soldier but also married to a high-caste Indian woman.  He had relied on his own prestige, and his cordial relations with the [[Nana Sahib]] to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition.\n\nThe besieged endured three weeks of the [[Siege of Cawnpore]] with little water or food, suffering continuous casualties to men, women and children.  On 25 June Nana Sahib made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad.  With barely three days' food rations remaining, the British agreed provided they could keep their small arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the night of the 26th).  Early in the morning of 27 June, the European party left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to [[Allahabad]].<ref>''The story of Cawnpore: The Indian Mutiny 1857'', Capt.

That very moment someone from the crowd blew a loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the boatmen jumped off the boats.  The rebels started shooting indiscriminately. Nana Sahib, who was staying in [[Savada Kothi]] ([[Bungalow]]) nearby, was informed about what was happening and immediately came to stop it.<ref>''Kaye's and Malleson's History of the Indian Mutiny''. Longman's, London, 1896.

After the sepoys refused to carry out this order, two Muslim butchers, two Hindu peasants and one of Nana's bodyguards went into The Bibigarh.

With Company forces approaching Cawnpore and some believing that they would not advance if there were no hostages to save, their murders were ordered. Or perhaps it was to ensure that no information was leaked after the fall of Cawnpore. Other historians have suggested that the killings were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib's relationship with the British.<ref name=autogenerated3>John Harris, The Indian mutiny, Wordsworth military library 2001, p. 92.</ref> Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1857 hospital wheeler cawnpore2.jpg|Photograph entitled, \"The Hospital in General Wheeler's entrenchment, Cawnpore\".

At the nearby town of [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]], a mob had attacked and murdered the local European population.

The British Commissioner resident at [[Lucknow]], [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Sir Henry Lawrence]], had enough time to fortify his position inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys, numbered some 1700 men. The rebels' assaults were unsuccessful, so they began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by [[John Eardley Inglis]]. The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via tunnels that led to underground close combat.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|486}} After 90 days of siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British soldiers and 550 non-combatants.\n\nOn 25 September, a relief column under the command of [[Sir Henry Havelock]] and accompanied by [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|Sir James Outram]] (who in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as 'The First Relief of Lucknow', as this force was not strong enough to break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the garrison. In October, another larger army under the new Commander-in-Chief, [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], was finally able to relieve the garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an orderly withdrawal, firstly to [[Alambagh]] {{convert|4|mi|km}} north where a force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]].\n\nIn March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh.

When the Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed to the [[British Raj]] by the [[Governor-General of India]] under the [[doctrine of lapse]]. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the [[Rani of Jhansi]], protested against the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company officials and their families took refuge in [[Jhansi Fort]], and the Rani negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the Europeans suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials.\n\nBy the end of June 1857, the Company had lost control of much of [[Bundelkhand]] and eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled, marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves. In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of [[Datia]] and [[Orchha]].\n\nOn 3 February, Sir [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Hugh Rose]] broke the 3-month siege of Saugor. Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them from rebel occupation.<ref>Essential Histories, the Indian Mutiny 1857\u201358, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, Osprey 2007, p. 79.</ref>\n\nIn March 1858, the Central India Field Force, led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise.\n\nAfter being driven from Jhansi and [[Kalpi]], on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of [[Gwalior]] from the [[Scindia]] rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the rebellion but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars]] according to the account of three independent Indian representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was compared to [[Joan of Arc]] by some commentators.<ref>Lachmi Bai Rani of Jhansi, the Jeanne d'Arc of India (1901), White, Michael (Michael Alfred Edwin), 1866, New York: J.F.

It included not only the present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan.\n\nMuch of the region had been the [[Sikh Empire]], ruled by [[Ranjit Singh]] until his death in 1839. The kingdom had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the [[Khalsa]] (the Sikh army) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both European and Indian troops.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably [[Ferozepore]], indecision on the part of the senior European officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi.<ref name=\"Project Gutenberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg}}</ref> At the most important garrison, that of [[Peshawar]] close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, [[Thomas Reed (British Army officer)|General Reed]], and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the \"Punjab Movable Column\" to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May.

In August, by the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the company was formally dissolved and its ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890\u20131923 |accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref> A new British government department, the [[India Office]], was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the [[Secretary of State for India]], was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, [[Viceroy of India]], and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the [[Straits Settlements]], became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at [[Westernization]]. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.\n\nEssentially the old East India Company bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by the Company to introduce free market competition had undermined traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at the mercy of merchants and money-lenders. In consequence the new [[British Raj]] was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a preservation of tradition and hierarchy.\n\nOn a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the creation of a new 'white collar' Indian elite, further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1858, in which it is expressly stated, \"We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity, duly to discharge.\"\n\nActing on these sentiments, [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]], viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the [[Ilbert Bill]]. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a [[white mutiny]] and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In 1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil service.\n\n===Military reorganisation===\n[[File:Captain C Scott of the Gen. Sir. Hope Grant's Column, Sepoy Mutiny, 1857.

Metcalf says Stokes undermines the assumption that 1857 was a response to general causes emanating from entire classes of people.  Instead, Stokes argues that 1) those Indians who suffered the greatest relative deprivation rebelled and that 2) the decisive factor in precipitating a revolt was the presence of prosperous magnates who supported British rule.  Stokes also explores issues of economic development, the nature of privileged landholding, the role of moneylenders, the usefulness of classical rent theory, and, especially, the notion of the \"rich peasant\".<ref>Thomas R.

Speaking in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in July 1857, [[Benjamin Disraeli]] labelled it a 'national revolt' while [[Lord Palmerston]], the Prime Minister, tried to downplay the scope and the significance of the event as a 'mere military mutiny'.<ref>''The Indian Mutiny and Victorian Trauma'' by Christopher Herbert, Princeton University Press, Princeton 2007.</ref> Reflecting this debate, an early historian of the rebellion, Charles Ball, used the word mutiny in his title, but labelled it a \"struggle for liberty and independence as a people\" in the text.<ref>''The History of the Indian Mutiny: Giving a detailed account of the sepoy insurrection in India'' by Charles Ball, The London Printing and Publishing Company, London, 1860.</ref> Historians remain divided on whether the rebellion can properly be considered a war of Indian independence or not,<ref>V.D. Savarkar argues that the rebellion was a war of Indian independence. ''The Indian War of Independence: 1857'' (Bombay: 1947 [1909]). Most historians have seen his arguments as discredited, with one venturing so far as to say, 'It was neither first, nor national, nor a war of independence.' Eric Stokes has argued that the rebellion was actually a variety of movements, not one movement. ''The Peasant Armed'' (Oxford: 1980). See also S. B. Chaudhuri, ''Civil Rebellion in the Indian Mutinies 1857\u20131859'' (Calcutta: 1957).</ref> although it is popularly considered to be one in India. Arguments against include:\n* A united India did not exist at that time in political, cultural, or ethnic terms;\n* The rebellion was put down with the help of other Indian soldiers drawn from the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Sikh regiments; 80% of the East India Company forces were Indian;<ref>The Indian Mutiny, Spilsbury Julian, Orion, 2007.</ref>\n* Many of the local rulers fought amongst themselves rather than uniting against the British;\n* Many rebel Sepoy regiments disbanded and went home rather than fight;\n* Not all of the rebels accepted the return of the Mughals;\n* The King of Delhi had no real control over the mutineers;<ref>S&T magazine issue 121 (September 1988), p. 20.</ref>\n* The revolt was largely limited to north and central India.

The reasons advanced are:\n* Even though the rebellion had various causes, most of the rebel sepoys who were able to do so, made their way to Delhi to revive the old [[Mughal empire]] that signified national unity for even the Hindus amongst them;\n* There was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as [[Awadh]], [[Bundelkhand]] and [[Rohilkhand]]. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region;\n* The sepoys did not seek to revive small kingdoms in their regions, instead they repeatedly proclaimed a \"country-wide rule\" of the Mughals and vowed to drive out the British from \"India\", as they knew it then. (The sepoys ignored local princes and proclaimed in cities they took over: ''Khalq Khuda Ki, Mulk Badshah Ka, Hukm Subahdar Sipahi Bahadur Ka'' \u2013 \"the people belong to God, the country to the Emperor and authority to the Sepoy Commandant\"). The objective of driving out \"foreigners\" from not only one's own area but from their conception of the entirety of \"India\", signifies a nationalist sentiment;\n* The mutineers, although some were recruited from outside Oudah, displayed a common purpose.<ref>[[Sitaram Yechury]].

It is from this story that the film ''[[Junoon (1978 film)|Junoon]]'' was later adapted in 1978 by [[Shyam Benegal]].\n* The 1880 novel ''[[The Steam House]]'' by [[Jules Verne]] takes place in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n* [[Jules Verne]]'s famous character [[Captain Nemo]], originally an Indian prince, fought on the side of the rebels during the rebellion (as stated in Verne's later novel [[The Mysterious Island]]).\n* [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1924 novel ''[[A Passage to India]]'' alludes several times to the Mutiny.\n* [[Flora Annie Steel]]'s novel ''[[On the Face of the Waters]]'' (1896) describes incidents of the Mutiny.\n* The plot of [[H. Beam Piper]]'s science fiction novel [[Uller Uprising]] is based on the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n* ''Rujub, the juggler'' and ''In Times of Peril: A tale of India'' by [[G.A.
