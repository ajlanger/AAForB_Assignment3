Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.\nIn the councils of government, '''we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military\u2013industrial complex'''. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.\nWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.

The government owned their own shipyards and weapons manufacturing facilities which they relied on through [[World War I]]. With [[World War II]] came a massive shift in the way that the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]] armed the [[American military|military]].\n\nWith the onset of World War II President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate civilian industries and shift them into wartime production. Throughout World War II arms production in the United States went from around one percent of the annual [[GDP]] to 40 percent of the GDP.<ref name=\":12\" /> Various American companies, such as [[Boeing]] and [[General Motors]], maintained and expanded their defense divisions.<ref name=\":12\" /> These companies have gone on to develop various technologies that have improved civilian life as well, such as [[Night-vision device|night-vision goggles]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]].<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== The Second Era ===\nThe start of the second era of the Military Industrial Complex is said to start with the coining of the term by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. This era continued through the Cold War period and finally saw the end of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1993 the Pentagon urged defense contractors to consolidate due to the collapse of communism and shrinking defense budget.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== The Third (Current) Era ===\nThe third era of the Military Industrial Complex has seen the most change as defense contractors either consolidated or shifted their focus to civilian innovation. From 1992 to 1997 there was a total of US$55 billion worth of mergers in the defense industry. Major defense companies purchased smaller defense companies and became the major companies that we know today.<ref name=\":12\" />\n[[File:Military Expenditures 2018 SIPRI.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for 2018, in US$ billions, according to SIPRI.]]\n\nIn the current era, the Military Industrial Complex is seen{{By whom|date=January 2019}} as a core part of American policy-making.

Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...\n\nThis conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence\u2014economic, political, even spiritual\u2014is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.\nIn the councils of government, '''we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military\u2013industrial complex'''. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.\nWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.

The government owned their own shipyards and weapons manufacturing facilities which they relied on through [[World War I]]. With [[World War II]] came a massive shift in the way that the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]] armed the [[American military|military]].\n\nWith the onset of World War II President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate civilian industries and shift them into wartime production. Throughout World War II arms production in the United States went from around one percent of the annual [[GDP]] to 40 percent of the GDP.<ref name=\":12\" /> Various American companies, such as [[Boeing]] and [[General Motors]], maintained and expanded their defense divisions.<ref name=\":12\" /> These companies have gone on to develop various technologies that have improved civilian life as well, such as [[Night-vision device|night-vision goggles]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]].<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== The Second Era ===\nThe start of the second era of the Military Industrial Complex is said to start with the coining of the term by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. This era continued through the Cold War period and finally saw the end of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1993 the Pentagon urged defense contractors to consolidate due to the collapse of communism and shrinking defense budget.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== The Third (Current) Era ===\nThe third era of the Military Industrial Complex has seen the most change as defense contractors either consolidated or shifted their focus to civilian innovation. From 1992 to 1997 there was a total of US$55 billion worth of mergers in the defense industry. Major defense companies purchased smaller defense companies and became the major companies that we know today.<ref name=\":12\" />\n[[File:Military Expenditures 2018 SIPRI.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for 2018, in US$ billions, according to SIPRI.]]\n\nIn the current era, the Military Industrial Complex is seen{{By whom|date=January 2019}} as a core part of American policy-making.
