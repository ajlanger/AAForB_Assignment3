The bomb was fastened on the dog and detonated upon contact with the target, killing the animal. Whereas in the first program, the dog was trained to locate a specific target, this task was simplified to find any enemy tank. Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nEach dog was fitted with a {{convert|10|\u2013|12|kg|lb|adj=on}} mine carried in two canvas pouches adjusted individually to each dog. The mine had a safety pin which was removed right before the deployment; each mine carried no markings and was not supposed to be disarmed. A wooden lever extended out of a pouch to about {{convert|20|cm|in}} in height. When the dog dived under the tank, the lever struck the bottom of the tank and detonated the charge. Because the underparts of the [[chassis]] were the most vulnerable area of these vehicles, it was hoped the explosion would disable the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |title=General Specifications |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021200611/http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=Zalgoa43/>\n\n==Deployment by the Soviet Union==\n[[File:F ww2 sov16.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Military parade on [[Red Square]], Moscow, 1 May 1938]]\nThe use of anti-tank dogs was escalated during 1941 and 1942, when every effort was made by the Red Army to stop the German advance at the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]]. In that period, the dog training schools were mostly focused on producing anti-tank dogs. About 40,000 dogs were deployed for various tasks in the Red Army.<ref name=axis>{{cite web|url=http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21/ |title=Our Allies...The Soviet Union and Their Use Of War Dogs |accessdate=8 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905041258/http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21 |archivedate=5 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by \"special departments\" (military counterintelligence).<ref name=rus2/> Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers.<ref name=rus2/> Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Red Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nAnother serious training mistake was revealed later; the Soviets used their own [[diesel engine]] tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had [[gasoline]] engines.<ref name=Zalgoa43/> As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks.<ref name=Bishop205/> This effectively meant that the Soviets had trained the dogs to sabotage their own army.\n\nThe efficiency of using anti-tank dogs in World War II remains uncertain. There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs.<ref name=rus1/> This claim was considered propaganda by many Russian historians who believed it was meant to justify the dog training program.<ref name=rus2/> There are, however, documented claims of individual successes of the program, with the number of damaged tanks usually being within a dozen.<ref name=rus1/><ref name=axis/> For example, at the front of the 160th Infantry Division near [[Hlukhiv]], six dogs had damaged five German tanks; near the airport of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], anti-tank dogs destroyed 13 tanks. At the [[Battle of Kursk]], 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks which had broken through the Soviet lines of defence near Tamarovka, Bykovo.<ref name=Zalgoa43>{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steve |title=The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941\u201345 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |date=1989|location=Oxford, United Kingdom |page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7YiBBfGqrAC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-0-85045-939-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=\u0411\u0438\u0440\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 (Biryukov G.

An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too low to the ground and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.<ref name=Zalgoa43/><ref name=Bishop205>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Chris |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II: The Comprehensive Guide to Over 1,500 Weapons Systems, Including Tanks, Small Arms, Warplanes, Artillery, Ships and Submarines |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |date=2002 |location=New York City |page=205|isbn=978-1-58663-762-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1942, the use of anti-tank dogs by the Red Army rapidly declined, and training schools were redirected to producing the more needed mine-seeking and delivery dogs.

The aim was for a dog to run into a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a timer. Dogs in this secret program were trained at [[Fort Belvoir]]. The dogs, called \"demolition wolves\", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit while waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6U537SjE7oC&pg=PA91|pages=89\u201391|title=War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism|author=Michael G.

The bomb was fastened on the dog and detonated upon contact with the target, killing the animal. Whereas in the first program, the dog was trained to locate a specific target, this task was simplified to find any enemy tank. Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nEach dog was fitted with a {{convert|10|\u2013|12|kg|lb|adj=on}} mine carried in two canvas pouches adjusted individually to each dog. The mine had a safety pin which was removed right before the deployment; each mine carried no markings and was not supposed to be disarmed. A wooden lever extended out of a pouch to about {{convert|20|cm|in}} in height. When the dog dived under the tank, the lever struck the bottom of the tank and detonated the charge. Because the underparts of the [[chassis]] were the most vulnerable area of these vehicles, it was hoped the explosion would disable the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |title=General Specifications |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021200611/http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=Zalgoa43/>\n\n==Deployment by the Soviet Union==\n[[File:F ww2 sov16.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Military parade on [[Red Square]], Moscow, 1 May 1938]]\nThe use of anti-tank dogs was escalated during 1941 and 1942, when every effort was made by the Red Army to stop the German advance at the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]]. In that period, the dog training schools were mostly focused on producing anti-tank dogs. About 40,000 dogs were deployed for various tasks in the Red Army.<ref name=axis>{{cite web|url=http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21/ |title=Our Allies...The Soviet Union and Their Use Of War Dogs |accessdate=8 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905041258/http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21 |archivedate=5 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by \"special departments\" (military counterintelligence).<ref name=rus2/> Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers.<ref name=rus2/> Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Red Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nAnother serious training mistake was revealed later; the Soviets used their own [[diesel engine]] tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had [[gasoline]] engines.<ref name=Zalgoa43/> As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks.<ref name=Bishop205/> This effectively meant that the Soviets had trained the dogs to sabotage their own army.\n\nThe efficiency of using anti-tank dogs in World War II remains uncertain. There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs.<ref name=rus1/> This claim was questioned by Russian historians as propaganda, trying to justify the dog training program.<ref name=rus2/> There are however documented claims of individual successes of the program, with the number of damaged tanks usually being within a dozen.<ref name=rus1/><ref name=axis/> For example, at the front of the 160th Infantry Division near [[Hlukhiv]], six dogs had damaged five German tanks; near the airport of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], anti-tank dogs destroyed 13 tanks. At the [[Battle of Kursk]], 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks which had broken through the Soviet lines of defence near Tamarovka, Bykovo.<ref name=Zalgoa43>{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steve |title=The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941\u201345 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |date=1989|location=Oxford, United Kingdom |page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7YiBBfGqrAC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-0-85045-939-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=\u0411\u0438\u0440\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 (Biryukov G.

An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too low to the ground and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.<ref name=Zalgoa43/><ref name=Bishop205>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Chris |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II: The Comprehensive Guide to Over 1,500 Weapons Systems, Including Tanks, Small Arms, Warplanes, Artillery, Ships and Submarines |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |date=2002 |location=New York City |page=205|isbn=978-1-58663-762-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1942, the use of anti-tank dogs by the Red Army rapidly declined, and training schools were redirected to producing the more needed mine-seeking and delivery dogs.

The aim was for a dog to run into a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a timer. Dogs in this secret program were trained at [[Fort Belvoir]]. The dogs, called \"demolition wolves\", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit while waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6U537SjE7oC&pg=PA91|pages=89\u201391|title=War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism|author=Michael G.
