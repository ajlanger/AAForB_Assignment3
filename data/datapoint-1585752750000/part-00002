The civil parish is made up of a number of settlements: Hermitage village, Little Hungerford and Wellhouse.\n\n==Location==\nThe village is [[nucleated village|focussed residentially]] on the B4009, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north east of Newbury in the heart of the [[North Wessex Downs]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. It is thus surrounded by protected woodlands and undulating fields providing a few elevated viewpoints.\n\n==Transport==\n===Roads===\nAccess to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] is within 5 miles (and it also passes through the edge of the parish), which links [[Wales]] to [[London]], and the [[A34 road (England)|A34]] passes through the edge of the parish, a main transport artery from the north to the south of the United Kingdom.\n\n===Public transport===\nFrom 1882 until the 1960s the village had [[Hermitage railway station|a minor halt station]]. The station was erected by the [[Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway]], also the name of its line.  As of 18 February 2013, Hermitage is served by buses 6 and 6A from [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].<ref>[https://images.reading-buses.co.uk/downloads/Kennections%20service%206%20timetable.pdf Reading Buses timetable]</ref>\n\n==Amenities==\nIt has a general store and [[post office]], a [[Church of England parish church|church]] (Holy Trinity) and two [[public house]]s (The Fox and The White Horse of Hermitage). There is a large garden centre with a cafe, bonsai shop, pool & spa concession and lawnmower centre. The village [[primary school]] feeds into the Downs School. The area is predominantly agricultural and the main local employers are the village school, village pre-school, the [[garden centre]] and a small light industrial unit housing several small businesses.\n\nThe [[Royal School of Military Survey]] at [[Denison Barracks]] houses a small garrison of troops and their families. However, though generally referred to as being in Hermitage, it is actually just across the border in the [[Curridge]] area of [[Chieveley]] parish.\n\n==History==\nOn Oare Common are two curvilinear ditched enclosures which are probably of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] date, although it has also been suggested that they may represent a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]]. The [[hill fort]] of [[Grimsbury Castle]] is in Grimsbury Wood. A [[folly]] stands at its centre. A 2nd and 3rd century [[Roman villa]] of some pretensions was discovered at Wellhouse in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]]. Between 1917 and 1918 [[D. H. Lawrence]] lived in Hermitage at Chapel Farm Cottage, Chapel Lane.<ref>[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-exhibitions/exhib_dhl/b7.phtml Online exhibitions - The University of Nottingham].
