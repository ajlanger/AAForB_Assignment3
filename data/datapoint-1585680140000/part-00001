The Bills hoped to improve on their 6\u201310 record from the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|2009]] season, and attempt to make the playoffs for the first time since [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|1999]]. The Bills had the 9th pick in the first round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]] selecting [[C. J. Spiller]], a [[running back]] from [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. This season marks the first 0\u20138 start since [[1984 Buffalo Bills season|1984]], in which they finished 2-14. They were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12, extending their playoff drought to 11 seasons. Despite the poor start, Buffalo became largely competitive after the bye in Week 9. Their next four losses were by only three points each, all to teams that made the playoffs that year\u2014Baltimore, Kansas City, Chicago and Pittsburgh (three of these losses went to overtime). The Bills eventually won four of their final eight games, which carried over into a strong start to the [[2011 Buffalo Bills season|2011 season]]. The 2010 season was marked by the emergence of wide receiver [[Stevie Johnson]], who gained 1,073 receiving yards and [[nose tackle]] [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]], an [[All-Pro]] in 2010 who gained status as an elite defensive tackle.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/29870/afc-easts-best-no-11-kyle-williams ESPN: AFC East's Best \u2013 #11]</ref><ref>[http://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2011/05/22/kyle-williams-beast/ Pro Football Focus \u2013 Kyle Williams: Beast]</ref><ref>[http://views.washingtonpost.com/theleague/smarterstats/2010/12/week-13-nfl-preview.html Washington Post \u2013 Week 13 NFL preview]</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\nThe Bills had fired head coach [[Dick Jauron]] after Week 10 of the 2009 season; he had been replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator [[Perry Fewell]]. The remainder of the Jauron coaching staff was released at the end of the year, including Fewell. Former [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Georgia Tech Yellowjackets football|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Chan Gailey]] was hired as the Bills' new head coach and [[Buddy Nix]] had taken over as general manager after a two-year vacancy in the position. (Current team CEO Russ Brandon had handled GM responsibilities.) Gailey installed the [[3-4 defense]] (although the team would play in a [[4-3 defense|4\u20133]] on certain downs) <ref>[http://www.footballoutsiders.com/four-downs/2011/four-downs-afc-east Football Outsiders: Four Downs \u2013 AFC East]</ref> and the \"[[Pistol offense|Pistol]]\" offensive formation. [[George Edwards (American football)|George Edwards]] was named defensive coordinator, and though Gailey stated he would call the offensive plays, [[Curtis Modkins]] was named the nominal offensive coordinator. On February 18, 2010, starting right tackle [[Brad Butler]] announced his retirement from professional football. Butler suffered a season ending (ultimately a career ending) knee injury vs. the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in week 2 of the 2009 season. The Bills held an open competition for the starting [[quarterback]] position between [[Trent Edwards]], [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] and [[Brian Brohm]] during training camp. Edwards was named starter prior to the first preseason game, but was released from the team after two poor performances. Fitzpatrick took over in Week 3 and, in 13 games, became the first Bills quarterback to throw for 3,000 passing yards in a season since [[J. P. Losman]] in [[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]].<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2010.htm Pro Football Reference \u2013 2010 Buffalo Bills]</ref><ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2006.htm}]</ref>\n\n===2010 Draft===\n{{main|2010 NFL Draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ 2010 Buffalo Bills Draft Selections\n!

It was Buffalo's first season with [[Buddy Nix]] in the role of general manager and head coach [[Chan Gailey]]. The Bills hoped to improve on their 6\u201310 record from the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|2009]] season, and attempt to make the playoffs for the first time since [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|1999]], the longest standing playoff drought in the NFL. The Bills had the 9th pick in the first round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]] selecting [[C. J. Spiller]], a [[running back]] from [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. This season marks the first 0\u20138 start since [[1984 Buffalo Bills season|1984]], in which they finished 2-14. They were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12, extending their playoff drought to 11 seasons. Despite the poor start, Buffalo became largely competitive after the bye in Week 9. Their next four losses were by only three points each, all to teams that made the playoffs that year\u2014Baltimore, Kansas City, Chicago and Pittsburgh (three of these losses went to overtime). The Bills eventually won four of their final eight games, which carried over into a strong start to the [[2011 Buffalo Bills season|2011 season]]. The 2010 season was marked by the emergence of wide receiver [[Stevie Johnson]], who gained 1,073 receiving yards and [[nose tackle]] [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]], an [[All-Pro]] in 2010 who gained status as an elite defensive tackle.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/29870/afc-easts-best-no-11-kyle-williams ESPN: AFC East's Best \u2013 #11]</ref><ref>[http://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2011/05/22/kyle-williams-beast/ Pro Football Focus \u2013 Kyle Williams: Beast]</ref><ref>[http://views.washingtonpost.com/theleague/smarterstats/2010/12/week-13-nfl-preview.html Washington Post \u2013 Week 13 NFL preview]</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\nThe Bills had fired head coach [[Dick Jauron]] after Week 10 of the 2009 season; he had been replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator [[Perry Fewell]]. The remainder of the Jauron coaching staff was released at the end of the year, including Fewell. Former [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Georgia Tech Yellowjackets football|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Chan Gailey]] was hired as the Bills' new head coach and [[Buddy Nix]] had taken over as general manager after a two-year vacancy in the position. (Current team CEO Russ Brandon had handled GM responsibilities.) Gailey installed the [[3-4 defense]] (although the team would play in a [[4-3 defense|4\u20133]] on certain downs) <ref>[http://www.footballoutsiders.com/four-downs/2011/four-downs-afc-east Football Outsiders: Four Downs \u2013 AFC East]</ref> and the \"[[Pistol offense|Pistol]]\" offensive formation. [[George Edwards (American football)|George Edwards]] was named defensive coordinator, and though Gailey stated he would call the offensive plays, [[Curtis Modkins]] was named the nominal offensive coordinator. On February 18, 2010, starting right tackle [[Brad Butler]] announced his retirement from professional football. Butler suffered a season ending (ultimately a career ending) knee injury vs. the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in week 2 of the 2009 season. The Bills held an open competition for the starting [[quarterback]] position between [[Trent Edwards]], [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] and [[Brian Brohm]] during training camp. Edwards was named starter prior to the first preseason game, but was released from the team after two poor performances. Fitzpatrick took over in Week 3 and, in 13 games, became the first Bills quarterback to throw for 3,000 passing yards in a season since [[J. P. Losman]] in [[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]].<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2010.htm Pro Football Reference \u2013 2010 Buffalo Bills]</ref><ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2006.htm}]</ref>\n\n===2010 Draft===\n{{main|2010 NFL Draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ 2010 Buffalo Bills Draft Selections\n!
