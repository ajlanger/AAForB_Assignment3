The winners of each group then played in a deciding final, for which, in 1983, the [[Malaysia]]n Ambassador donated a cup for the Man of the Match. The main S.C.A. competition has been reorganized several times since and the current league format<ref>[https://www.cricketswitzerland.ch/seniors/40-over-league/2017/ 40-over domestic league] Retrieved 14 July 2018.</ref> involves fifteen clubs divided into East & West divisions.\n\nIn recent years, the Mr. Pickwick T20 Cup,<ref>[https://www.cricketswitzerland.ch/seniors/pickwick-t20-league/ Mr. Pickwick T20 Cup] Retrieved 14 July 2018.</ref> a [[Twenty20]] Competition, has been added to the fixture schedule.\n\nIn 1985, at the initiative of the [[Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz|Lyceum Alpinum, Zuoz]], the SCA helped to organise the first Zuoz Cricket Festival. The Lyceum has a long tradition of cricket and other \"[[United Kingdom|British]]\" sports (e.g. Eton Fives) dating from the 1920s when an English sports master was appointed. Four cricket matches can be played simultaneously on the grounds at Zuoz in an idyllic setting at an altitude of {{convert|1700|m}}. Following a modest start (only four clubs participated in 1985), the festival is now well established with the regular participation of eight clubs.\n\nA Swiss national side played in the inaugural Cricketer International Tournament in [[Guernsey]] in 1990, narrowly missing the semi-final by 0.1 runs/over.
