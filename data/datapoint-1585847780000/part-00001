Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [[global warming]], leading to [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic sea ice shrinkage]], diminished ice in the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and [[Arctic methane release]] as the [[permafrost]] thaws.\n\nDue to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on||order=flip}} per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by [[tree line]] and temperature) is currently shrinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |last=Hansen |first=Jim |title=The Planet in Peril \u2013 Part I |publisher=Yale Center for the Study of Globalization |date=19 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015173024/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}</ref> Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage.

An example of a dwarf shrub is the [[bearberry]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).\n\n=== Animals ===\n{{see also|List of Arctic cetaceans}}{{Category see also|Fauna of the Arctic|Mammals of the Arctic}}\n[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]\n[[File:Snowy Owl Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[snowy owl]]]]\nHerbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]]. They are preyed on by the [[snowy owl]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Grizzly bear]], and [[Arctic wolf]]. The [[polar bear]] is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [[:Category:Birds of the Arctic|birds]] and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other terrestrial animals include [[wolverine]]s, [[moose]], [[Dall sheep]], [[Stoat|ermines]], and [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s. Marine mammals include [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and several species of [[cetacea]]n\u2014[[baleen whale]]s and also [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[Beluga whale|belugas]].

The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.\n\nThe Arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region. The Arctic also holds 1/5 of the Earth's water supply.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Paleontology==\n[[File:Arctic fossils.jpg|Marine [[fossils]] in [[Canadian Arctic]]|thumb]]\nDuring the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous time period]], the Arctic still had seasonal snows, though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth.

The initial focus of the campaign will be a UN resolution creating a global sanctuary around the pole, and a ban on oil drilling and unsustainable fishing in the Arctic.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Stars-launch-campaign-to-save-the-Arctic/ Stars launch campaign to save the Arctic]. [[Greenpeace]]  (21 June 2012).</ref>\n\n== Global warming ==\n{{Main|Global warming in the Arctic}}\n\nThe [[effects of global warming]] in the Arctic include rising temperatures, loss of [[sea ice]], and melting of the [[Greenland ice sheet]]. Potential [[Arctic methane release|methane release]] from the region, especially through the thawing of [[permafrost]] and [[methane clathrates]], is also a concern.  Because of the [[Polar amplification|amplified response of the Arctic]] to global warming, it is often seen as a leading indicator of [[global warming]].  The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to polar amplification.<ref>[http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/study-2015-melting-greenland-ice-faster-arctic-warming-0616/ Study links 2015 melting Greenland ice to faster Arctic warming] 9 June 2016 University of Georgia</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms11723 | pmid=27277547 | pmc=4906163 | volume=7 | title=Arctic cut-off high drives the poleward shift of a new Greenland melting record | journal=Nature Communications | page=11723| bibcode=2016NatCo...711723T | last1=Tedesco | first1=M. | last2=Mote | first2=T. | last3=Fettweis | first3=X. | last4=Hanna | first4=E. | last5=Jeyaratnam | first5=J. | last6=Booth | first6=J.F. | last7=Datta | first7=R. | last8=Briggs | first8=K. | year=2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|[[Arctic shrinkage|Arctic sea ice coverage]] as of 2007 compared to 2005 and compared to 1979\u20132000 average]]\n\nThe Arctic is especially vulnerable to the effects of any [[climate change]], as has become apparent with the reduction of sea ice in recent years.

Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [[global warming]], leading to [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic sea ice shrinkage]], diminished ice in the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and [[Arctic methane release]] as the [[permafrost]] thaws.\n\nDue to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on||order=flip}} per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by [[tree line]] and temperature) is currently shrinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |last=Hansen |first=Jim |title=The Planet in Peril \u2013 Part I |publisher=Yale Center for the Study of Globalization |date=19 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015173024/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}</ref> Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage.

An example of a dwarf shrub is the [[bearberry]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).\n\n=== Animals ===\n{{see also|List of Arctic cetaceans}}{{Category see also|Fauna of the Arctic|Mammals of the Arctic}}\n[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]\n[[File:Snowy Owl Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[snowy owl]]]]\nHerbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]].

There are also many [[:Category:Birds of the Arctic|birds]] and marine species endemic to the colder regions.

The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.\n\nThe Arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region.
