Walras advocated for a free market economy in which capital, production, and exchange remain in the hands of private actors. However, he also proposed the full socialization of the product of land.

However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nMill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}} As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching. In the case of [[Oxford University]], it was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''.\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]], writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jakcson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]\u2014as perfect or imperfect as it might be\u2014continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism ({{lang-de|freiheitlicher Sozialismus}}).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n{{main|Action Party (Italy)|Giustizia e Libert\u00e0}}\n[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]\nItalian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as \"organised liberalism\".

State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940 that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole.

His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology:{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} {{quote|In no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and [[amoral]] [[nihilism]].

His brand of socialism is closer to what is now commonly referred to as Georgism, due to American economist Henry George (though Walras first published on the subject in 1861, a few years before George). Walras advocated for a free market economy in which capital, production, and exchange remain in the hands of private actors. However, he also proposed the full socialization of the product of land. This included, not only taxation on land value but even the repurchase of all land by the state so that it could be publicly owned and land rents could become socialized wealth.\"|5a1=Muellwe|5y=2020}} Other important liberal socialist figures include {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}},{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} [[Piero Gobetti]], [[Leonard Hobhouse]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[R. H. Tawney]].{{sfn|Dale|2016}} To Polanyi, liberal socialism's goal was overcoming exploitative aspects of capitalism by expropriation of landlords and opening to all the opportunity to own land.{{sfn|Dale|2016|p=61}}\n\nLiberal socialism has been particularly prominent in British and Italian politics.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} Its seminal ideas can be traced to John Stuart Mill, who theorised that capitalist societies should experience a gradual process of [[Social ownership|socialisation]] through [[Cooperative|worker-controlled enterprises]], coexisting with [[private enterprise]]s.{{sfn|Miller|2003|pp=213\u2013238}} Mill rejected [[centralised]] models of socialism that he thought might discourage competition and creativity, but he argued that representation is essential in a free government and democracy could not subsist if economic opportunities were not well distributed, therefore conceiving democracy not just as form of representative government, but as an entire social organisation.{{sfn|Brlhante|Rocha|2010|pp=17\u201327}}\n\nWhile socialists have been hostile to liberalism, accused of \"providing an ideological cover for the depredation of capitalism\", it has been pointed out that \"the goals of liberalism are not so different from those of the socialists\", although this similarly in goals has been described as being deceptive due to the different meanings liberalism and socialism give to [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|liberty, equality and solidarity]].{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1a2=Harrison|1y=2003|1pp=220\u2013222|2a1=Anton|2a2=Schmitt|2y=2012|2pp=3\u20134}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Britain ===\n==== John Stuart Mill ====\n[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], influential 19th century English thinker of [[liberalism]] who adopted some [[Socialism|socialist]] views]]\nThe main liberal English thinker [[John Stuart Mill]]'s early [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] was one of [[free market]]s. However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nMill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}} As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching. In the case of [[Oxford University]], it was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''.\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]], writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jakcson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]\u2014as perfect or imperfect as it might be\u2014continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism ({{lang-de|freiheitlicher Sozialismus}}).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n{{main|Action Party (Italy)|Giustizia e Libert\u00e0}}\n[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]\nItalian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as \"organised liberalism\". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Rosselli|1y=1994|2a1=Steger|2y=2006|2p=146}} In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=99}}\n\nWhile appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \"bourgeois capitalism\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940 that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole. This is where the socialist tradition of thought might still have something to contribute to the democratic project and herein lies the promise of a liberal socialism.}}\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn 1919, the Hungarian politician [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]] declared his support for what he termed \"liberal socialism\" while denouncing \"communist socialism\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} Opposed to classical social democracy's prevalent focus on support from the working class, J\u00e1szi saw the middle class and smallholder peasants as essential to the development of socialism and spoke of the need of a \"radical middle-class\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} His views were especially influenced by events in Hungary in 1919 involving the [[Bolshevik]] revolution during which he specifically denounced the Marxist worldview shortly after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], calling his views \"Anti-Marx\". His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology:{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} {{quote|In no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and [[amoral]] [[nihilism]]. New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found.}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, [[statism]] and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of [[Bolshevik communism]] came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|communist party]]-rule.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Liberalism]]\n* [[Liberal Socialist Party (Switzerland)]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social liberalism]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Third Way]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anton|first1=Anatole|last2=Schmitt|first2=Richard|year=2012|title=Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher=Lxeington Books|isbn=9780739166352|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Roland Willey|year=1970|title=The Success of Modern Private Enterprise|publisher=Interstate Printers & Publishers|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bastow|first1=Steve|last2=Martin|first2=James|year=2003|title=Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Baum|first=Bruce|chapter=J.
