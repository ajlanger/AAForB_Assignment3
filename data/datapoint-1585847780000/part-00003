On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the other two throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Note that the curves are essentially parallel since about March 20 except for California, which shows a slower growth rate.  One interpretation is that New Jersey is about two weeks behind New York, and the other States (except California) are about three weeks behind New York.  The Institute for Health Measurments and Evaluation (IHME) publishes estimates for the U.S. and for each State<ref>https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections</ref> showing estimates for required hosptial beds, ICU beds, and ventilators; the page presents separate graphics for estimates of death rate and total deaths.  The date of peak resource requirements are a function of number of current infections, growth rate, and the population of the state.  As of April 3 2020, the IHME models show peak hospital bed requirements for New Jersey on about April 8, for California on about April 26, for Florida on about May 3, etc.\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=600\n|height=400\n|showValues=\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle=No. of cases\n|legend=Legend\n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x= Feb 26, Feb 27, Feb 28, Feb 29, Mar 1, Mar 2, Mar 3, Mar 4, Mar 5, Mar 6, Mar 7, Mar 8, Mar 9, Mar 10, Mar 11, Mar 12, Mar 13, Mar 14, Mar 15, Mar 16, Mar 17, Mar 18, Mar 19, Mar 20, Mar 21, Mar 22, Mar 23, Mar 24, Mar 25, Mar 26, Mar 27, Mar 28, Mar 29, Mar 30, Mar 31, Apr 1\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1=0,0,0,0,1,1,2,11,22,44,89,105,142,173,216,325,421,613,729,950,1374,2480,5711,8402,10356,15168,20875,25665,30811,37258,44635,52318,59513,66497,75795,83712\n|y2=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,6,11,15,23,29,50,69,98,178,267,427,742,890,1327,1914,2844,3675,4402,6876,8825,11124,13386,16636,18696,22259\n|y3=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,60,69,88,114,133,157,177,198,247,335,392,472,598,675,1006,1224,1468,1733,2102,2535,3006,3801,4643,5100,5763,6932,8155\n|y4=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,12,25,33,53,54,65,80,334,549,787,1035,1328,1791,2295,2856,3657,4650,5486,6498,7615,9334\n|y5=00,0,,0,0,0,2,2,3,8,17,18,19,28,31,49,77,115,149,160,216,328,432,563,763,1007,1227,1467,1977,2484,3198,4038,4950,5704,6741,7773\n|yScaleType=<!--log This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis, so leave it blank here!-->\n|y1Title=New York\n|y2Title=New Jersey\n|y3Title=California\n|y4Title=Michigan\n|y5Title=Florida\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 1 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n{{further|Timeline of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n[[File:COVID-19 outbreak New York CSA per capita cases map.svg|thumb|Confirmed cases per 10,000 inhabitants near New York City.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

Note that the curves are essentially parallel since about March 20 except for California, which shows a slower growth rate.  One interpretation is that New Jersey is about two weeks behind New York, and the other States (except California) are about three weeks behind New York.  The Institute for Health Measurments and Evaluation (IHME) publishes estimates for the U.S. and for each State<ref>https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections</ref> showing estimates for required hosptial beds, ICU beds, and ventilators; the page presents separate graphics for estimates of death rate and total deaths.  The date of peak resource requirements are a function of number of current infections, growth rate, and the population of the state.  As of April 3 2020, the IHME models show peak hospital bed requirements for New Jersey on about April 8, for California on about April 26, for Florida on about May 3, etc.\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=600\n|height=400\n|showValues=\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle=No. of cases\n|legend=Legend\n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x= Feb 26, Feb 27, Feb 28, Feb 29, Mar 1, Mar 2, Mar 3, Mar 4, Mar 5, Mar 6, Mar 7, Mar 8, Mar 9, Mar 10, Mar 11, Mar 12, Mar 13, Mar 14, Mar 15, Mar 16, Mar 17, Mar 18, Mar 19, Mar 20, Mar 21, Mar 22, Mar 23, Mar 24, Mar 25, Mar 26, Mar 27, Mar 28, Mar 29, Mar 30, Mar 31, Apr 1\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1=0,0,0,0,1,1,2,11,22,44,89,105,142,173,216,325,421,613,729,950,1374,2480,5711,8402,10356,15168,20875,25665,30811,37258,44635,52318,59513,66497,75795,83712\n|y2=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,6,11,15,23,29,50,69,98,178,267,427,742,890,1327,1914,2844,3675,4402,6876,8825,11124,13386,16636,18696,22259\n|y3=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,60,69,88,114,133,157,177,198,247,335,392,472,598,675,1006,1224,1468,1733,2102,2535,3006,3801,4643,5100,5763,6932,8155\n|y4=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,12,25,33,53,54,65,80,334,549,787,1035,1328,1791,2295,2856,3657,4650,5486,6498,7615,9334\n|y5=00,0,,0,0,0,2,2,3,8,17,18,19,28,31,49,77,115,149,160,216,328,432,563,763,1007,1227,1467,1977,2484,3198,4038,4950,5704,6741,7773\n|yScaleType=<!--log This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis, so leave it blank here!-->\n|y1Title=New York\n|y2Title=New Jersey\n|y3Title=California\n|y4Title=Michigan\n|y5Title=Florida\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 1 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n{{further|Timeline of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n[[File:COVID-19 outbreak New York CSA per capita cases map.svg|thumb|Confirmed cases per 10,000 inhabitants near New York City.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.
