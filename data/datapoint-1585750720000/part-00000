Miena, pronounced 'my-enna' , translates to 'lagoon-like'. These names were applied to the area by the Hydro-Electric Commission (Tas.).\n\nThe settler and first Sheriff of Tasmania, John Beaumont, explored the Central Highlands plateau during December 1817. The Beaumont Memorial and grave is a short walk from the Dam<!--, close to the site of Shannon Rise -->.\n\nIn 1831 [[George Augustus Robinson|G.A. Robinson]], the Conciliator of the Aborigines was searching the Central Highlands for signs of \"the natives\". He camped at the site of the future dam at Miena, where he reported \"large numbers of swan, a number of light-coloured kangaroo and signs of platypus\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stancombe |first1=G.H. |title=Notes on the history of the Central Plateau |url=https://eprints.utas.edu.au/14609/1/notes_on_the_history_of_central_Stancombe.pdf |publisher=UTas ePrints}}</ref>\n\nMurderers Hill, elevation 1055 meters opposite the Great Lake Hotel, takes its name from the murder there of a shepherd and convict hut keeper by bushrangers in 1840<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Lake Hotel |url=http://www.greatlakehotel.com.au/facilities.htm}}</ref>.\n\nIn the period of the Gold Rush and the Tasmanian depression of the 1860s, Tasmania's high country was occupied only by Aborigines, shepherds and the occasional [[bushranger]]. Early colonists used the alpine Central Highlands as summer pastures employing shepherds and hut keepers. Hunters were attracted to the Central Plateau, and from the 1890s to the 1960s trapping for pelts was a significant activity.\n\nThe introduction of the [[trout]] to Tasmanian lakes brought hundreds of visitors to the highlands in the 1890s.

The community postal agency is now located in the Central Highland Lodge. An amateur radio repeater is installed on Barren Tier nearby.\n\nMiena Dam has three dam walls although two are often submerged. The [[Hydro Tasmania|Tasmanian Hydro Electric Power and Metallurgical Co.]] built a small dam at the outlet from the Great Lake in 1911. Construction of canals and pipelines conveyed the water to Waddamana where it was intended to generate power for the treatment of complex ores. In 1914 the Government acquired the company, and by May 1916 two turbo-alternators had been installed at [[Waddamana Power Stations|Waddamana Power Station]]. In 1919-1922 a multi-arch dam was constructed at Miena to increase the Great Lake storage and the power station was expanded to supply more power.  In 1967 a sloping core rock-fill dam was built downstream; this was raised again in 1982. \n\nWaddamana Power Station is now a museum and heritage site, with restored machinery and displays about the pioneering days of power development in the highlands.  \n\nMany of the local lakes and lagoons, including Penstock lagoon and the Great Lake, were part of the [[World Fly Fishing Championships]] of 1988 and 2012.  Little Pine Lagoon has been described as Tasmania's premier fly fishing water location. The 2019 WFFC was again conducted in the area. \nThe geographic centre of Tasmania is located on the western shore of the lagoon.\n\nThe section of the Highland Lakes Road to nearby Liawenee was sealed during 2015.
