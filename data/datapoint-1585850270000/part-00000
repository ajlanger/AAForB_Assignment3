Cohen]], lyrics by [[Dean Pitchford]], and music by [[Michael Gore]]. Adapted from [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', it focuses on an awkward teenage girl with [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic powers]] whose lonely life is dominated by an oppressive [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] mother. When she is humiliated by her classmates at the high school [[prom]], she unleashes chaos on everyone and everything in her path.\n\nOriginally premiering in England in 1988, ''Carrie'' came to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the same year, and closed after 16 previews and 5 performances. Because of the passionate response from both its critics and its fans, the show is considered one of the most notable flops in Broadway musical history; a 1991 book written by Ken Mandelbaum, which chronicled the history of flop Broadway musicals, was partially titled ''Not Since Carrie''.\n\n==Production history==\nInspired by a 1981 performance of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]],<ref name=\"DVD featurette\">{{cite video | title = Carrie's DVD featurette (\"Singing Carrie\") | publisher=[[United Artists]] | date=2002}}</ref> [[Lawrence D. Cohen]], who wrote the script for the 1976 film version of [[Carrie (1976 film)|''Carrie'']], and [[Michael Gore]] began work on a musical based on the [[Stephen King]] novel.  Gore's ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' collaborator, [[Dean Pitchford]], was brought in to work on the project, which underwent numerous rewrites.<ref>{{cite web| title = Carrie R.S.C.

It was soon announced that ''Carrie'' would be produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1986.<ref name=\"flop\">Mandelbaum 348</ref> Funding was not raised until late 1987.\n\n===Stratford try-out===\nThe show was produced by Friedrich Kurz and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and had its first four-week run beginning on February 13, 1988 in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], England, where it received mixed reviews. Directed by [[Terry Hands]] and [[choreography|choreographed]] by [[Debbie Allen]], the cast included [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] veteran and [[cabaret]] singer [[Barbara Cook]], [[Charlotte d'Amboise]], [[Gene Anthony Ray]], [[Darlene Love]], and [[Linzi Hateley]], in her stage debut, as Carrie. The massive, technically complex production by designer [[Ralph Koltai]] featured pyrotechnics, lasers, automated scenery and a gigantic white flying staircase that appeared for the show's tragic finale (with a lighting rig underneath lighting most of the show). \n\nThe production was plagued with script and technical problems.  The crew was unable to douse Hateley with fake blood without causing her microphone to malfunction. Rewrites continued following each show,<ref>{{cite web| title = Linzi Hateley \"Green Room Radio\" Interview| publisher = greenroomradio.com| url = http://www.greenroomradio.com/?p=59| accessdate = }}</ref> and the program cited a song, \"Once I Loved a Boy,\" which had been rewritten and retitled \"When There's No One\" prior to the first performance. Cook resigned when she was nearly decapitated by an elaborate set piece - the White's Living Room, during \"Open Your Heart\" - on opening night, but she agreed to stay on until a replacement could be cast, which turned out to be the remainder of the show's Stratford run.<ref name=\"flop\" /> A musical section of the \"Locker Room Scene\" (which has come to be known as \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\") was removed after the initial few performances, and another song, \"White Star,\" was later excised.\n\n===1988 Broadway production===\nThe show transferred to Broadway at an expense of $8 million (at the time an exorbitant amount). Hateley (who ultimately won a [[Theatre World Award]]) and other members of the UK cast remained with the show, but Cook was replaced by [[Betty Buckley]] (who had played the teacher [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Collins]] in the 1976 [[Carrie (1976 film)|film version]]).\n\nThe show started previews on April 28, 1988, at the [[August Wilson Theatre|Virginia Theatre]]. After the final song, boos were heard mixed in with applause. [[Ken Mandelbaum]] is quoted by Wollman, MacDermot, and Trask: \"Ken Mandelbaum writes of an audience divided during early previews, the curtain calls of which were greeted with a raucous mix of cheers and boos.<ref>Wollman, Elizabeth L., MacDermot, Galt, and Trask, Stephen (2006), ''The theater will rock'', University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0-472-11576-6}}, p. 140.</ref>  However, in an instant, when Linzi Hateley and [[Betty Buckley]] rose to take their bows, the entire theatre turned to a standing ovation.

After class, the girls head to the [[locker room]] and have fun teasing a less attractive, plump girl named [[Carrie White]].\n\nThe girls start to shower while talking about boys and their plans for the upcoming prom (\"Dream On\"). Carrie has her first [[menstruation|period]] in the shower and, not understanding what is happening, thinks she is bleeding to death.  The other girls taunt her mercilessly until Miss Gardner hears the commotion, sends the girls away, and explains menstruation to Carrie.\n\nOn the way out of the gym, Sue and Chris talk about what just happened in the locker room. Sue is already feeling remorseful for her part in the incident, but Chris calls Carrie \"Scary White.\" Carrie is hurt by their name-calling and teasing, but dreams of being vindicated and gaining respect from her peers (\"Carrie\").\n\nCarrie's mother Margaret is praying (\"Open Your Heart\") when Carrie arrives home. Carrie joins her mother in prayer for a few minutes and then explains what happened in the locker room. Margaret tells Carrie that the blood is a sign of her sin (\"And Eve Was Weak\") and forces her into the cellar to pray for forgiveness.\n\nThat night, many of the high school students are at the [[drive-in theater]], including Sue and her boyfriend Tommy and Chris and her boyfriend Billy. Sue tells Tommy that she is still upset about what she and the other girls did to Carrie in the locker room, while Chris complains about Carrie to Billy (\"Don't Waste the Moon\"). While the other teenagers are at the drive-in, Carrie and Margaret are home praying (\"Evening Prayers\"). Margaret prays for the strength to help her daughter while Carrie, depressed, questions God's love for her.  Margaret apologizes for hurting Carrie and assures her that she loves her unconditionally.\n\nAt school the following day, Miss Gardner tells the girls they must all apologize to Carrie. Sue and the other girls comply, but Chris refuses. Upset, Miss Gardner tells Chris that she will not be allowed to go to the prom, and Chris vows revenge.  Miss Gardner encourages Carrie to dream about her Prince Charming (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nStill upset over the way Carrie has been treated, Sue asks Tommy to take Carrie to the prom instead of her (\"Do Me a Favor\"), and he reluctantly agrees. At the same time, Chris asks Billy to help her get revenge on Carrie.\n\nTommy surprises Carrie by knocking on her door and asking her to go to prom. Though at first confused and uneasy, Carrie eventually agrees to go with him. When she tells her mother the news (\"Invited\"), Margaret forbids her to go, insisting that all boys just want to take advantage of girls, including her own father (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"), and the prom would be an occasion of sin. Carrie reveals her supernatural powers, telling her mother that she is determined to attend the prom and will not be stopped.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nThe act opens at a pig farm while a storm rages, where Chris, Billy, and several of his friends are on a mission (\"Out for Blood\"). For their planned revenge on Carrie, they kill a pig and collect its blood.  Back at the high school, Sue is confronted by girls who are upset that Carrie is going to the prom. Sue believes she is doing the right thing but realizes that doing the right thing is not always easy (\"It Hurts to be Strong\").\n\nGetting ready for the prom, Carrie dreams about her date and, in a positive display of her special powers, she sends her dress, shoes, and hairbrush dancing through the air (\"I'm Not Alone\"). Margaret tries one more time to convince Carrie not to go to the prom (\"Carrie (Reprise)\"), but Carrie doesn't listen. She leaves for the prom with Tommy.  Alone, Margaret plans to save Carrie from damnation the only way she can (\"When There's No One\").\n\nTommy and Carrie arrive at the prom (\"Wotta Night\") and everyone is surprised at how beautiful Carrie is. Miss Gardner is there as a chaperone and talks to Carrie about how it feels to be in love (\"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\"). Carrie is nervous about dancing with Tommy, but he finally convinces her to go out on the dance floor with him (\"Heaven\"). As the votes for prom king and queen are cast, Tommy, Carrie, Sue, Chris, Billy, and Miss Gardner soliloquize about the events unfolding (\"Heaven (Reprise)\").  Tommy and Carrie are declared king and queen of the prom, and they are crowned as the students sing the \"Alma Mater\".\n\nSuddenly, Billy and Chris appear and dump a bucket of pig blood on Carrie. Humiliated and incensed, Carrie realizes her full powers.  She closes off the gym exit and kills everyone present (\"The Destruction\"). After Carrie leaves the prom, she is met by her mother, who somehow followed her into the school.  Margaret comforts her daughter (\"Carrie (2nd Reprise)\") and then stabs her fatally, thinking it will save Carrie's soul.  Carrie retaliates, killing Margaret with her powers, and she apologizes as her mother dies.  Sue, the sole survivor who escaped this massacre, finds Carrie and comforts her as she dies.\n\n===2012 production===\n\n'''Act I'''\n\n[[Sue Snell]], haunted witness and tour guide to our story, struggles to recount the incidents leading up to the tragic night of May 28. As she's questioned about the past, figures from her life in high school appear. Whatever their differences \u2013 be they good girl Sue, her varsity-athlete boyfriend Tommy Ross, her spoiled-rotten best friend Chris Hargensen, Chris' trouble-maker boyfriend Billy Nolan, or perennial misfit Carrie White \u2013 they are all wrestling with the same insecurities and united in their desire to belong (\"In\").\n\nAfter gym class, Carrie experiences her first period in the shower. Her terrified screams for help and seeming ignorance about what's happening to her amuse and inflame the girls. With Chris as ringleader, Sue and the others encircle Carrie, gleefully chanting names and savagely taunting her. As gym teacher Miss Gardner races in at the height of Carrie's hysteria, an overhead light bulb inexplicably explodes. When the girls are reprimanded, they dismissively rationalize, \"It's just Carrie,\" the butt of their jokes since childhood.\n\nMiss Gardner and guidance counselor/English teacher Mr. Stephens send Carrie home for the rest of the day. But even as she leaves, her classmates' hurtful insults and name-calling ricochet in Carrie's mind until she cracks in fury (\"Carrie\"). Tommy and his pals discuss the upcoming senior prom as Billy roars in on his skateboard, clowning around. Carrie passes by and he jeeringly ridicules her. But when she turns a furious glance in his direction, he goes sprawling. Angry and embarrassed, Billy tries to blame his seeming clumsiness on Carrie, but the other guys just laugh.\n\nAt the White bungalow, Carrie's mother Margaret works at her sewing machine and sings along to her favorite evangelical radio program (\"Open Your Heart\"). When the still-troubled Carrie arrives home, she reluctantly joins in the hymn. Carrie summons the courage to tell her mother about the day's traumatic event. The realization that her child is now a woman throws Margaret into a God-fearing panic. When Carrie resists, Margaret locks her in a closet to beg for repentance (\"And Eve Was Weak\").\n\nWith her parents out of town, Chris throws a party at which she recounts to the kids the details of that day's incident with Carrie in the locker room. When Sue \u2013 confused and upset about her role in the hazing \u2013 protests that it wasn't funny, Chris perversely instructs her in the natural order of things (\"The World According to Chris\"). Upset by Chris' toxic message, Sue turns her back on her best friend and leaves with Tommy.\n\nBack at the White household, Carrie is still locked in her prayer closet surrounded by religious icons. Margaret, meanwhile, pleads for her own divine guidance. As Carrie puzzles over this new sensation she's been feeling, she grows more agitated. Suddenly, a little figurine of Jesus levitates, leaving Carrie to wonder if this strange power might possibly be coming from within her. Margaret releases her from the closet and tearfully apologizes for her actions, prompting Carrie to beg for forgiveness as well. The two find solace in each other's goodnight embrace (\"Evening Prayers\").\n\nIn English class, Mr. Stephens praises a poem Tommy has written, and has him recite his work (\"Dreamer in Disguise\"). When the teacher asks the unruly students for reactions, Carrie volunteers. Her heartfelt emotion only provokes the other kids' mockery. After class, Sue acts on Tommy's advice and tries to apologize to Carrie but, thinking it's some kind of trick, Carrie explodes at her and storms off. Shaken and shocked into awareness, Sue muses on their encounter (\"Once You See\"). Miss Gardner rebukes the girls for their reckless mistreatment of Carrie and demands that they apologize to her \u2013 or else they will be sent to detention for one week. They all do, except for Chris, who instead hurls a vicious invective at Carrie, causing Miss Gardner to change Chris's charge from detention to suspension, thus kicking her out of the prom. Frantic, Chris tries to rally the girls to join her in defying their teacher until Sue shouts defiance. Battle lines are drawn; the best friends are now enemies. When Miss Gardner apologizes to the sobbing Carrie for what just happened, Carrie surprises her by insisting that she's got to let Chris go to Prom. Carrie points out that for girls like Chris, Prom is like a dream. When pressed, Carrie admits that she herself is not going. Moved by Carrie's lack of self-esteem and her need for support, Miss Gardner assures her that things can change (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nDetermined to do right by Carrie, Sue asks Tommy for help with a plan she's devised. Similarly, Chris, blaming Carrie for her humiliation, interrupts a make-out session with Billy to get his help in her plot for revenge (\"Do Me A Favor\"). Alone in the library, Carrie reads about telekinesis from a book. Concentrating intensely, she succeeds in moving chairs across the room without touching them, startling herself with this newfound power. In retrospect, the exploding light bulb in the shower and Billy's tumble from his skateboard start to make sense.\n\nNervous but honoring Sue's request, Tommy arrives at Carrie's front door and asks her to Prom. Wary, she repeatedly refuses, until Margaret calls her in for dinner. Worried that her mother will find her with Tommy, Carrie hurriedly accepts the offer to be his date. As he leaves, she calls out a joyous \"thank you\" as it begins to rain. While the storm outside intensifies, Carrie excitedly tells Margaret of her Prom invitation, triggering Margaret's own tortured reverie (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"). When she orders Carrie to tell Tommy that she can't go, they battle and, as rain starts to blow in, Margaret walks away to close the windows. \"I'll get them!\" Carrie shouts and uses her mind to slam them shut. Horrified by this display of power that she's certain is the work of the devil, Margaret cowers in fear as Carrie calmly finishes her dessert.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nPreparations for Prom and the news that Tommy's taking Carrie preoccupy everyone at school, including Chris and Billy, who sneak into the gymnasium with a bucket of pig's blood and set their own nasty prank in place (\"A Night We'll Never Forget\"). Miss Gardner, suspicious of Sue's motives in having Tommy invite Carrie, warns them both that if they hurt Carrie in any way, they'll have to answer to her. Sue worries that Tommy is mad at her too, but insists he's merely disappointed, wanting to take his girlfriend to Prom. To make up for the event they're going to miss, he takes her into the half-decorated gym to share a private romantic moment (\"You Shine\").\n\nIt's finally Prom Night. The kids are electric with nervous excitement, and Carrie, no less anxious, resolves to make the most of the evening (\"Why Not Me?\"). Frantic with worry, Margaret tries to undermine Carrie's confidence (\"Stay Here Instead\"). Just then, Tommy arrives, and Carrie, looking ravishing in the gown she's made herself, departs with him. Alone, Margaret struggles with fundamentalist scriptures. \"She must be sacrificed. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" Her duty \u2013 however horrific and tragic \u2013 is clear (\"When There's No One\").\n\nAt the gym, the psyched kids show off their Prom finery and pose for yearbook photos. Tommy enters with Carrie, and the crowd's reaction to her stunning transformation turns from initially hostile to unexpectedly welcoming (\"Prom Arrival\"). Miss Gardner, surprised and delighted by Carrie's new self-assurance, shares her own recollection of Prom, and teacher and student trade notes on this timeless high school ritual (\"Unsuspecting Hearts \u2013 Reprise\"). After much coaxing, Tommy leads a hesitant Carrie onto the dance floor where they're observed \u2013 first by Sue, who's felt compelled to sneak in and see how her plan has worked out, and then by Chris' partner-in-crime, Norma (\"Dreamer in Disguise \u2013 Reprise\"). Chris and Billy, hidden high in the rafters above, prepare to unleash their prank, as Sue comes upon Norma switching real Prom ballots for fake ones, arousing her suspicions (\"Prom Climax\").\n\nVotes tabulated, Mr. Stephens and Miss Gardner announce Tommy and Carrie as Prom King and Queen. While the assembled salute them with the school song (\"Alma Mater\"), Sue spots the bucket dangling above the coronation area, confirming her worst suspicions. Frantic, she tries to warn Miss Gardner, but the teacher, who's been wary of Sue's motives in forgoing her Prom in favor of Carrie, pushes her out of the gym. Chris cues Billy, who yanks the bucket and drenches Carrie in blood. As the Prom-goers' stunned silence turns to derisive laughter, her unimaginable humiliation turns to fury \u2013 and then madness. Lashing out with her power, she exacts a terrible revenge on friend and foe alike (\"The Destruction\"). Powerless, Sue watches her classmates all perish. She alone survives. As emergency whistles sound and sirens wail, Sue follows the path of destruction that leads through the street to Carrie's house.\n\nCarrie arrives home in her bloody prom dress and finds momentary solace in her mother's arms (\"Carrie \u2013 Reprise\"). Just as she's lulled into a sense of safety, Margaret \u2013 fulfilling what she believes to be her biblical duty \u2013 plunges a knife into her daughter. Wounded and trying to defend herself from further assault, Carrie uses her powers to stop her mother's heart. Sue stumbles into this horrific scene and, hearing Carrie's anguished cries, rushes to her side to comfort her. But she's too late. As Carrie dies in her arms, the figures from Sue's memory provide a final, haunting testimony of redemption (\"Epilogue\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Stratford-upon-Avon===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, and Girls\n* \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Margaret and Carrie\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Crackerjack\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"Dream On (The Prom)\" \u2013 Girls\n* \"White Star\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" (Reprise) \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Finale)\" \u2013 Margaret{{col-end}}\n\n===Broadway===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, Girls\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Out for Blood\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"It Hurts to Be Strong\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" - Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night!\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue, Miss Gardner, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Off-Broadway revival===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"In\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Reverend Bliss, Margaret, Carrie, Choir\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"The World According to Chris\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Sue, Tommy, Kids\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise\" \u2013 Tommy\n* \"Once You See\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Tommy, Billy, Kids\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"A Night We'll Never Forget\" \u2013 Carrie, Chris, Billy, Sue, Ensemble\n* \"You Shine\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue\n* \"Why Not Me?\" \u2013 Carrie, Kids\n* \"Stay Here Instead\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Prom Arrival\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Carrie, Miss Gardner\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise (Reprise)\" \u2014 Tommy, Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Prom Climax\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Carrie, Tommy, Ensemble\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Epilogue\" \u2013 Sue, Ensemble\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:70%;\"| Description\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carrie White]]\n| The main character, Carrie is a shy outcast who is often bullied by her classmates.

After suffering a breakdown after being doused in pig's blood, Carrie kills her entire class and teachers due to setting the school on fire, only to come home to be fatally stabbed by her mother.

When she is humiliated by her classmates at the high school [[prom]], she unleashes chaos on everyone and everything in her path.\n\nOriginally premiering in England in 1988, ''Carrie'' came to [[Broadway]] the same year, and closed after 16 previews and 5 performances. Because of the passionate response from both its critics and its fans, the show is considered one of the most notable flops in Broadway musical history; a 1991 book written by Ken Mandelbaum, which chronicled the history of flop Broadway musicals, was partially titled ''Not Since Carrie''.\n\n==Production history==\nInspired by a 1981 performance of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]],<ref name=\"DVD featurette\">{{cite video | title = Carrie's DVD featurette (\"Singing Carrie\") | publisher=[[United Artists]] | date=2002}}</ref> [[Lawrence D.

Directed by [[Terry Hands]] and [[choreography|choreographed]] by [[Debbie Allen]], the cast included [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] veteran and [[cabaret]] singer [[Barbara Cook]], [[Charlotte d'Amboise]], [[Gene Anthony Ray]], [[Darlene Love]], and [[Linzi Hateley]], in her stage debut, as Carrie. The massive, technically complex production by designer [[Ralph Koltai]] featured pyrotechnics, lasers, automated scenery and a gigantic white flying staircase that appeared for the show's tragic finale (with a lighting rig underneath lighting most of the show). \n\nThe production was plagued with script and technical problems.  The crew was unable to douse Hateley with fake blood without causing her microphone to malfunction. Rewrites continued following each show,<ref>{{cite web| title = Linzi Hateley \"Green Room Radio\" Interview| publisher = greenroomradio.com| url = http://www.greenroomradio.com/?p=59| accessdate = }}</ref> and the program cited a song, \"Once I Loved a Boy,\" which had been rewritten and retitled \"When There's No One\" prior to the first performance. Cook resigned when she was nearly decapitated by an elaborate set piece - the White's Living Room, during \"Open Your Heart\" - on opening night, but she agreed to stay on until a replacement could be cast, which turned out to be the remainder of the show's Stratford run.<ref name=\"flop\" /> A musical section of the \"Locker Room Scene\" (which has come to be known as \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\") was removed after the initial few performances, and another song, \"White Star,\" was later excised.\n\n===1988 Broadway production===\nThe show transferred to Broadway at an expense of $8 million (at the time an exorbitant amount). Hateley (who ultimately won a [[Theatre World Award]]) and other members of the UK cast remained with the show, but Cook was replaced by [[Betty Buckley]] (who had played the teacher [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Collins]] in the 1976 [[Carrie (1976 film)|film version]]).\n\nThe show started previews on April 28, 1988, at the [[August Wilson Theatre|Virginia Theatre]]. After the final song, boos were heard mixed in with applause. [[Ken Mandelbaum]] is quoted by Wollman, MacDermot, and Trask: \"Ken Mandelbaum writes of an audience divided during early previews, the curtain calls of which were greeted with a raucous mix of cheers and boos.<ref>Wollman, Elizabeth L., MacDermot, Galt, and Trask, Stephen (2006), ''The theater will rock'', University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0-472-11576-6}}, p. 140.</ref>  However, in an instant, when Linzi Hateley and [[Betty Buckley]] rose to take their bows, the entire theatre turned to a standing ovation.

After class, the girls head to the [[locker room]] and have fun teasing a less attractive, plump girl named [[Carrie White]].\n\nThe girls start to shower while talking about boys and their plans for the upcoming prom (\"Dream On\"). Carrie has her first [[menstruation|period]] in the shower and, not understanding what is happening, thinks she is bleeding to death.  The other girls taunt her mercilessly until Miss Gardner hears the commotion, sends the girls away, and explains menstruation to Carrie.\n\nOn the way out of the gym, Sue and Chris talk about what just happened in the locker room. Sue is already feeling remorseful for her part in the incident, but Chris calls Carrie \"Scary White.\" Carrie is hurt by their name-calling and teasing, but dreams of being vindicated and gaining respect from her peers (\"Carrie\").\n\nCarrie's mother Margaret is praying (\"Open Your Heart\") when Carrie arrives home. Carrie joins her mother in prayer for a few minutes and then explains what happened in the locker room. Margaret tells Carrie that the blood is a sign of her sin (\"And Eve Was Weak\") and forces her into the cellar to pray for forgiveness.\n\nThat night, many of the high school students are at the [[drive-in theater]], including Sue and her boyfriend Tommy and Chris and her boyfriend Billy. Sue tells Tommy that she is still upset about what she and the other girls did to Carrie in the locker room, while Chris complains about Carrie to Billy (\"Don't Waste the Moon\"). While the other teenagers are at the drive-in, Carrie and Margaret are home praying (\"Evening Prayers\"). Margaret prays for the strength to help her daughter while Carrie, depressed, questions God's love for her.  Margaret apologizes for hurting Carrie and assures her that she loves her unconditionally.\n\nAt school the following day, Miss Gardner tells the girls they must all apologize to Carrie. Sue and the other girls comply, but Chris refuses. Upset, Miss Gardner tells Chris that she will not be allowed to go to the prom, and Chris vows revenge.  Miss Gardner encourages Carrie to dream about her Prince Charming (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nStill upset over the way Carrie has been treated, Sue asks Tommy to take Carrie to the prom instead of her (\"Do Me a Favor\"), and he reluctantly agrees. At the same time, Chris asks Billy to help her get revenge on Carrie.\n\nTommy surprises Carrie by knocking on her door and asking her to go to prom. Though at first confused and uneasy, Carrie eventually agrees to go with him. When she tells her mother the news (\"Invited\"), Margaret forbids her to go, insisting that all boys just want to take advantage of girls, including her own father (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"), and the prom would be an occasion of sin. Carrie reveals her supernatural powers, telling her mother that she is determined to attend the prom and will not be stopped.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nThe act opens at a pig farm while a storm rages, where Chris, Billy, and several of his friends are on a mission (\"Out for Blood\"). For their planned revenge on Carrie, they kill a pig and collect its blood.  Back at the high school, Sue is confronted by girls who are upset that Carrie is going to the prom. Sue believes she is doing the right thing but realizes that doing the right thing is not always easy (\"It Hurts to be Strong\").\n\nGetting ready for the prom, Carrie dreams about her date and, in a positive display of her special powers, she sends her dress, shoes, and hairbrush dancing through the air (\"I'm Not Alone\"). Margaret tries one more time to convince Carrie not to go to the prom (\"Carrie (Reprise)\"), but Carrie doesn't listen. She leaves for the prom with Tommy.  Alone, Margaret plans to save Carrie from damnation the only way she can (\"When There's No One\").\n\nTommy and Carrie arrive at the prom (\"Wotta Night\") and everyone is surprised at how beautiful Carrie is. Miss Gardner is there as a chaperone and talks to Carrie about how it feels to be in love (\"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\"). Carrie is nervous about dancing with Tommy, but he finally convinces her to go out on the dance floor with him (\"Heaven\"). As the votes for prom king and queen are cast, Tommy, Carrie, Sue, Chris, Billy, and Miss Gardner soliloquize about the events unfolding (\"Heaven (Reprise)\").  Tommy and Carrie are declared king and queen of the prom, and they are crowned as the students sing the \"Alma Mater\".\n\nSuddenly, Billy and Chris appear and dump a bucket of pig blood on Carrie. Humiliated and incensed, Carrie realizes her full powers.  She closes off the gym exit and kills everyone present (\"The Destruction\"). After Carrie leaves the prom, she is met by her mother, who somehow followed her into the school.  Margaret comforts her daughter (\"Carrie (2nd Reprise)\") and then stabs her fatally, thinking it will save Carrie's soul.  Carrie retaliates, killing Margaret with her powers, and she apologizes as her mother dies.  Sue, the sole survivor who escaped this massacre, finds Carrie and comforts her as she dies.\n\n===2012 production===\n\n'''Act I'''\n\n[[Sue Snell]], haunted witness and tour guide to our story, struggles to recount the incidents leading up to the tragic night of May 28. As she's questioned about the past, figures from her life in high school appear. Whatever their differences \u2013 be they good girl Sue, her varsity-athlete boyfriend Tommy Ross, her spoiled-rotten best friend Chris Hargensen, Chris' trouble-maker boyfriend Billy Nolan, or perennial misfit Carrie White \u2013 they are all wrestling with the same insecurities and united in their desire to belong (\"In\").\n\nAfter gym class, Carrie experiences her first period in the shower. Her terrified screams for help and seeming ignorance about what's happening to her amuse and inflame the girls. With Chris as ringleader, Sue and the others encircle Carrie, gleefully chanting names and savagely taunting her. As gym teacher Miss Gardner races in at the height of Carrie's hysteria, an overhead light bulb inexplicably explodes. When the girls are reprimanded, they dismissively rationalize, \"It's just Carrie,\" the butt of their jokes since childhood.\n\nMiss Gardner and guidance counselor/English teacher Mr. Stephens send Carrie home for the rest of the day. But even as she leaves, her classmates' hurtful insults and name-calling ricochet in Carrie's mind until she cracks in fury (\"Carrie\"). Tommy and his pals discuss the upcoming senior prom as Billy roars in on his skateboard, clowning around. Carrie passes by and he jeeringly ridicules her. But when she turns a furious glance in his direction, he goes sprawling. Angry and embarrassed, Billy tries to blame his seeming clumsiness on Carrie, but the other guys just laugh.\n\nAt the White bungalow, Carrie's mother Margaret works at her sewing machine and sings along to her favorite evangelical radio program (\"Open Your Heart\"). When the still-troubled Carrie arrives home, she reluctantly joins in the hymn. Carrie summons the courage to tell her mother about the day's traumatic event. The realization that her child is now a woman throws Margaret into a God-fearing panic. When Carrie resists, Margaret locks her in a closet to beg for repentance (\"And Eve Was Weak\").\n\nWith her parents out of town, Chris throws a party at which she recounts to the kids the details of that day's incident with Carrie in the locker room. When Sue \u2013 confused and upset about her role in the hazing \u2013 protests that it wasn't funny, Chris perversely instructs her in the natural order of things (\"The World According to Chris\"). Upset by Chris' toxic message, Sue turns her back on her best friend and leaves with Tommy.\n\nBack at the White household, Carrie is still locked in her prayer closet surrounded by religious icons. Margaret, meanwhile, pleads for her own divine guidance. As Carrie puzzles over this new sensation she's been feeling, she grows more agitated. Suddenly, a little figurine of Jesus levitates, leaving Carrie to wonder if this strange power might possibly be coming from within her. Margaret releases her from the closet and tearfully apologizes for her actions, prompting Carrie to beg for forgiveness as well. The two find solace in each other's goodnight embrace (\"Evening Prayers\").\n\nIn English class, Mr. Stephens praises a poem Tommy has written, and has him recite his work (\"Dreamer in Disguise\"). When the teacher asks the unruly students for reactions, Carrie volunteers. Her heartfelt emotion only provokes the other kids' mockery. After class, Sue acts on Tommy's advice and tries to apologize to Carrie but, thinking it's some kind of trick, Carrie explodes at her and storms off. Shaken and shocked into awareness, Sue muses on their encounter (\"Once You See\"). Miss Gardner rebukes the girls for their reckless mistreatment of Carrie and demands that they apologize to her \u2013 or else they will be sent to detention for one week. They all do, except for Chris, who instead hurls a vicious invective at Carrie, causing Miss Gardner to change Chris's charge from detention to suspension, thus kicking her out of the prom. Frantic, Chris tries to rally the girls to join her in defying their teacher until Sue shouts defiance. Battle lines are drawn; the best friends are now enemies. When Miss Gardner apologizes to the sobbing Carrie for what just happened, Carrie surprises her by insisting that she's got to let Chris go to Prom. Carrie points out that for girls like Chris, Prom is like a dream. When pressed, Carrie admits that she herself is not going. Moved by Carrie's lack of self-esteem and her need for support, Miss Gardner assures her that things can change (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nDetermined to do right by Carrie, Sue asks Tommy for help with a plan she's devised. Similarly, Chris, blaming Carrie for her humiliation, interrupts a make-out session with Billy to get his help in her plot for revenge (\"Do Me A Favor\"). Alone in the library, Carrie reads about telekinesis from a book. Concentrating intensely, she succeeds in moving chairs across the room without touching them, startling herself with this newfound power. In retrospect, the exploding light bulb in the shower and Billy's tumble from his skateboard start to make sense.\n\nNervous but honoring Sue's request, Tommy arrives at Carrie's front door and asks her to Prom. Wary, she repeatedly refuses, until Margaret calls her in for dinner. Worried that her mother will find her with Tommy, Carrie hurriedly accepts the offer to be his date. As he leaves, she calls out a joyous \"thank you\" as it begins to rain. While the storm outside intensifies, Carrie excitedly tells Margaret of her Prom invitation, triggering Margaret's own tortured reverie (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"). When she orders Carrie to tell Tommy that she can't go, they battle and, as rain starts to blow in, Margaret walks away to close the windows. \"I'll get them!\" Carrie shouts and uses her mind to slam them shut. Horrified by this display of power that she's certain is the work of the devil, Margaret cowers in fear as Carrie calmly finishes her dessert.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nPreparations for Prom and the news that Tommy's taking Carrie preoccupy everyone at school, including Chris and Billy, who sneak into the gymnasium with a bucket of pig's blood and set their own nasty prank in place (\"A Night We'll Never Forget\"). Miss Gardner, suspicious of Sue's motives in having Tommy invite Carrie, warns them both that if they hurt Carrie in any way, they'll have to answer to her. Sue worries that Tommy is mad at her too, but insists he's merely disappointed, wanting to take his girlfriend to Prom. To make up for the event they're going to miss, he takes her into the half-decorated gym to share a private romantic moment (\"You Shine\").\n\nIt's finally Prom Night. The kids are electric with nervous excitement, and Carrie, no less anxious, resolves to make the most of the evening (\"Why Not Me?\"). Frantic with worry, Margaret tries to undermine Carrie's confidence (\"Stay Here Instead\"). Just then, Tommy arrives, and Carrie, looking ravishing in the gown she's made herself, departs with him. Alone, Margaret struggles with fundamentalist scriptures. \"She must be sacrificed. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" Her duty \u2013 however horrific and tragic \u2013 is clear (\"When There's No One\").\n\nAt the gym, the psyched kids show off their Prom finery and pose for yearbook photos. Tommy enters with Carrie, and the crowd's reaction to her stunning transformation turns from initially hostile to unexpectedly welcoming (\"Prom Arrival\"). Miss Gardner, surprised and delighted by Carrie's new self-assurance, shares her own recollection of Prom, and teacher and student trade notes on this timeless high school ritual (\"Unsuspecting Hearts \u2013 Reprise\"). After much coaxing, Tommy leads a hesitant Carrie onto the dance floor where they're observed \u2013 first by Sue, who's felt compelled to sneak in and see how her plan has worked out, and then by Chris' partner-in-crime, Norma (\"Dreamer in Disguise \u2013 Reprise\"). Chris and Billy, hidden high in the rafters above, prepare to unleash their prank, as Sue comes upon Norma switching real Prom ballots for fake ones, arousing her suspicions (\"Prom Climax\").\n\nVotes tabulated, Mr. Stephens and Miss Gardner announce Tommy and Carrie as Prom King and Queen. While the assembled salute them with the school song (\"Alma Mater\"), Sue spots the bucket dangling above the coronation area, confirming her worst suspicions. Frantic, she tries to warn Miss Gardner, but the teacher, who's been wary of Sue's motives in forgoing her Prom in favor of Carrie, pushes her out of the gym. Chris cues Billy, who yanks the bucket and drenches Carrie in blood. As the Prom-goers' stunned silence turns to derisive laughter, her unimaginable humiliation turns to fury \u2013 and then madness. Lashing out with her power, she exacts a terrible revenge on friend and foe alike (\"The Destruction\"). Powerless, Sue watches her classmates all perish. She alone survives. As emergency whistles sound and sirens wail, Sue follows the path of destruction that leads through the street to Carrie's house.\n\nCarrie arrives home in her bloody prom dress and finds momentary solace in her mother's arms (\"Carrie \u2013 Reprise\"). Just as she's lulled into a sense of safety, Margaret \u2013 fulfilling what she believes to be her biblical duty \u2013 plunges a knife into her daughter. Wounded and trying to defend herself from further assault, Carrie uses her powers to stop her mother's heart. Sue stumbles into this horrific scene and, hearing Carrie's anguished cries, rushes to her side to comfort her. But she's too late. As Carrie dies in her arms, the figures from Sue's memory provide a final, haunting testimony of redemption (\"Epilogue\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Stratford-upon-Avon===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, and Girls\n* \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Margaret and Carrie\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Crackerjack\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"Dream On (The Prom)\" \u2013 Girls\n* \"White Star\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" (Reprise) \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Finale)\" \u2013 Margaret{{col-end}}\n\n===Broadway===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, Girls\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Out for Blood\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"It Hurts to Be Strong\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" - Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night!\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue, Miss Gardner, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Off-Broadway revival===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"In\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Reverend Bliss, Margaret, Carrie, Choir\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"The World According to Chris\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Sue, Tommy, Kids\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise\" \u2013 Tommy\n* \"Once You See\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Tommy, Billy, Kids\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"A Night We'll Never Forget\" \u2013 Carrie, Chris, Billy, Sue, Ensemble\n* \"You Shine\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue\n* \"Why Not Me?\" \u2013 Carrie, Kids\n* \"Stay Here Instead\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Prom Arrival\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Carrie, Miss Gardner\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise (Reprise)\" \u2014 Tommy, Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Prom Climax\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Carrie, Tommy, Ensemble\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Epilogue\" \u2013 Sue, Ensemble\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:70%;\"| Description\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carrie White]]\n| The main character, Carrie is a shy outcast who is often bullied by her classmates. While showering at school, Carrie has her first period, for which the other girls in her class tease her. This event sparks the emergence of Carrie's telekinetic powers, which she ultimately uses for revenge after being cruelly pranked at the prom. After suffering a breakdown after being doused in pig's blood, Carrie kills her entire class and teachers due to setting the school on fire, only to come home to be fatally stabbed by her mother. Carrie then uses her powers to kill her mother, dying shortly afterwards (of her stab wound) comforted by Sue.\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Margaret White (Stephen King)|Margaret White]]\n| One of the main antagonists of the show. Carrie's overprotective and abusive mother, Margaret is a religious zealot. Although she loves Carrie and wants to protect her from the world, especially from the school, her fanaticism often drives her to homeschool or abuse her daughter. After Carrie develops telekinesis and goes to the prom against her wishes, Margaret comes to believe that killing Carrie is a sacrifice and that is the only way to save her from damnation. Carrie uses her telekinetic powers to stop her mother's heart in retaliation after being stabbed by her.\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Sue Snell]]\n| This main character is one of the most popular girls at school, Sue initially teases Carrie like all the other girls, but later feels remorse for what she's done. To make up for all she's done, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to prom instead of her. Sue goes to the prom to see how things ended up and when she realizes that Carrie is in trouble she goes to Miss Gardner for help. However, Miss Gardner throws Sue out of the prom, thinking that she is trying to humiliate Carrie.
