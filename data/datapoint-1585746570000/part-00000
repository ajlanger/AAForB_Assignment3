Lieutenant-colonel of the [[r\u00e9giment de Metz]] from 1785, he actively adhered to the principles of the Revolution, unlike his elder brother [[Jean-Pierre du Teil|Jean-Pierre]] (who only accommodated rather than backed the Revolution, and was thus executed).  From then on his rise within the army was meteoric: promoted to the rank of colonel in 1790, he soon became [[mar\u00e9chal de camp]] (23 August 1792) then  g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division (11 August 1793).  He was made commander in chief of the artillery of the [[arm\u00e9e du Rhin]] (1792), then that of the [[arm\u00e9e des Alpes]] and [[arm\u00e9e d\u2019Italie]] (1793), participating in the [[siege of Toulon]].\n\nDisdaining this last posting, he left it as soon as possible to go to command the artillery in the Alps, and the representatives of the people chose as his replacement a young officer called [[Napoleon I of France|Bonaparte]], who gained his first successes in this role. Du Teil next served in the [[war in the Vend\u00e9e]] in 1794.  Discharged from the army as an aristocrat, he was only recalled to the ranks under the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], when he was put in command of the [[citadel of Lille|place de Lille]], then that of Metz.  He was made a commander of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur then a knight of the order of Saint Louis.  He retired in 1813 to the village of [[Ancy-sur-Moselle]].\n\nOn 26 November 1771 he married Marguerite-Louise Georgin de Mardigny (daughter of Fran\u00e7ois-Etienne, conseiller to the parliament of Metz, and of Barbe Lucie Besser de Charly) at [[Mardigny]].
