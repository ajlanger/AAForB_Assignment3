He acquired works of art to use in the advertisements, most famously [[John Everett Millais]]' painting ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'', which he turned into an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap in the foreground. Millais was said to be unhappy about the alteration, but he could do nothing, as Barratt had acquired the copyright.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.asp?venue=7&id=299 Lady Lever Gallery, 'Bubbles', by Sir John Everett Millais]</ref> Barratt followed this with a series of advertisements inspired by Millais' painting, portraying cute children in idealized middle-class homes, associating Pears with social aspiration and domestic comfort.\n\nBarratt also made effective use of testimonials, recruiting both scientists and glamorous high-society figures.
