The first round is the \"Preliminary Heat\" where the bakers are first told of their themes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/shows/2015/09/halloween-baking-championship|title=Five Things You Didn\u2019t Know About \"Halloween Baking Championship\"}}</ref> and get varying cook times (anywhere from 30 minutes up to 2 hours) to create a small pastry (usual cookies or small cakes). The person who wins the first round gets an advantage going into the next round, and aren't told until after the second round is announced (and sometimes they're not told until the middle of cooking in the second round). The advantage varies by episode (''Ex'': exclusive use of a certain baking mold/ingredient or first choice of a specific theme).\n\nThe second round is called the \"Main Heat\" and the contestants get a considerably longer time to bake than the \"pre-heat\" (in the final round of the final episode they're given several hours to make a large confection). This larger dessert must fit a new theme presented (usually in the same vein as the pre-heat theme). One baker is eliminated every episode except for the last one. In the finale it's down to the final three or four contestants competing in a winner-take-all final round. The winner gets $25,000.\n\n==Host & Judges==\nUnlike its sister show, [[Holiday Baking Championship]], the panel of judges has changed each of the first three seasons (with the exception of Carla Hall). In each episode, the judges come out dressed in costume for the Main Heat, to keep with the spirit of Halloween.\n\nThe first season was hosted by Richard Blais with chefs Carla Hall, Ron Ben-Israel and Sherry Yard serving as judges. The second season saw Carla Hall as the only returning chef/judge. She was joined by Food Network personality Sandra Lee and Damiano Carrara to help judge, and Comedian Jeff Dunham was the host. Since season three, show has been hosted by John Henson. Lorraine Pascale and Zac Young joined Carla Hall as judges for the third and fourth seasons, while Katie Lee replaced Pascale for season five. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.multivu.com/players/English/79699512-food-network-halloween-baking-new-season/|title=Spellbinding Sweets Fill The New Season Of Halloween Baking Championship Hosted By John Henson}}</ref> \n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main| List of Halloween Baking Championship episodes}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\"|Originally aired\n|-\n!First aired\n!Last aired\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF7E00;
