The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, while the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Additionally, events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\", airing between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash'', and a two-issue comic featuring characters and concepts unable to appear in the live-action episodes, tie into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which is inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". Moreover, the preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] served as a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several \"Paragons\" from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying all of reality. The crossover's events resulted in the Arrowverse's continuity being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014, with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", with the crossover title revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. In mid-2019, multiple castings were announced, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. \"Crisis\" also sees [[Cress Williams]] from fellow CW series ''Black Lightning'' appear and cross over with the Arrowverse for the first time, along with actors reprising their roles from various DC film and television series. Filming took place from the end of September 2019 until the beginning of November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming Crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect various items.<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> The former also retrieves the cadaver of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the Crisis date has moved up to December 2019 and that to save billions, the Flash must die.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> To learn more about what happens to him, Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse. They send Barry's mind forward in time, causing him to see billions of timelines where the multiverse is destroyed and the one where he dies saving it.<ref name=\"Flash602\" />\n\nMeanwhile, on one of his missions, Oliver witnesses the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] from an antimatter wave.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> Back in [[Star City (Arrowverse)|Star City]], [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William Clayton]], [[Connor Hawke (Arrowverse Earth-1)|Connor Hawke]], and [[Mia Smoak]] mysteriously time travel from 2040 to the present,<ref name=\"Arrow803\" /> while Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] learn that [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] has been working with the Monitor.<ref name=\"Arrow805\" /> Minutes before the Crisis begins, [[Nash Wells]] is teleported into a chamber under [[Central City (Arrowverse)|Central City]] after being promised a new life.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> As the Crisis starts, red skies loom over Central City and [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], where Lyla, now a \"Harbinger of things to come\", collects Oliver and Mia.<ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807\" />\n\nOn an unspecified Earth, the skies turn red over Freeland, causing [[Jennifer Pierce (Arrowverse)|Jennifer Pierce]]'s powers to adversely react and tear her between her Earth and those of two of her alternate counterparts. As the Pierce family and [[Peter Gambi (Arrowverse)|Peter Gambi]] try to bring her back, the antimatter wave overtakes them while [[Jefferson Pierce (Arrowverse)|Jefferson Pierce]] is teleported away.<ref name=\"Black Lightning Crisis ep\">{{Cite episode |title=The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis |episode-link=The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis |series=Black Lightning |series-link=Black Lightning (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=3 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nAs the Crisis begins, the antimatter wave destroys countless parallel universes.{{efn|Some of these named on screen included: [[Earth-89 (Arrowverse)|Earth-89]], [[Earth-9 (Arrowverse)|Earth-9]], [[Earth-X (Arrowverse)|Earth-X]] and [[Earth-66 (Arrowverse)|Earth-66]].}} On [[Earth-38 (Arrowverse)|Earth-38]], [[Brainiac 5 (Arrowverse)|Brainiac 5]] detects the antimatter wave approaching [[Argo City (Arrowverse)|Argo City]], prompting [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers]] to warn her mother [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]], her cousin [[Clark Kent (Arrowverse)|Clark Kent]], and his wife [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]]. Clark and Lois narrowly send their son [[Jonathan Kent (Arrowverse)|Jonathan]] off into an escape pod just as the wave wipes out Argo alongside Alura. Harbinger brings Barry, [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Kate Kane]], [[Sara Lance]] and [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] to Earth-38, while also rescuing the Kents from Argo. Harbinger briefs the gathered heroes on the threat of the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] as the Monitor raises a quantum tower to impede the antimatter wave while the [[Department of Extranormal Operations (Arrowverse)|DEO]] and [[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena Luthor]] work to evacuate Earth-38's inhabitants to [[Earth-1 (Arrowverse)|Earth-1]]. Brainy locates Jonathan's pod on [[Earth-16 (Arrowverse)|Earth-16]], so he, Lois, and Sara leave to retrieve him while the others stay behind to fend off the Anti-Monitor's forces. In preparation for his death, Oliver passes the mantle of Green Arrow to Mia. When he learns Barry is fated to die however, he argues with the Monitor over the deal they made last year.{{efn|As depicted in the 2018 crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\".}} The heroes make their stand at the tower and fend off an army of shadow demons until the Monitor teleports them off-world, deeming the battle to be lost. Refusing to leave, Oliver temporarily nullifies the Monitor and stays behind to ensure the exodus succeeds. Back on Earth-1, Lois' team returns with Jonathan before the Monitor brings a dying Oliver to say good-bye, commenting that this was not how he was supposed to die. Nash, now a \"Pariah\" for releasing the Anti-Monitor, appears and announces that events have changed and everything is doomed.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 1 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One |series=Supergirl |series-link=Supergirl (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=9 |airdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the Earth-1 [[Legends of Tomorrow (Arrowverse team)|Legends]] unavailable, Harbinger recruits [[Earth-74 (Arrowverse)|Earth-74]]'s [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] so the heroes can use his ''Waverider'' as their base of operations. In the wake of Oliver's death, which he cannot undo because of the Anti-Monitor's growing power, the Monitor consults the Book of Destiny and learns of seven Paragons who could turn the tide; the \"Paragon of Hope\", Kara; the \"Paragon of Destiny\", Sara; the \"Paragon of Truth\", a Superman who has suffered \"more than any mortal man\"; and the \"Paragon of Courage\", who is described as the \"Bat of the Future\". Clark, Lois, and Iris locate the second Superman on [[Earth-96 (Arrowverse)|Earth-96]], though Lex uses the Book of Destiny to mind-control that Earth's Clark until Lois knocks Lex out. Kara and Kate travel to [[Earth-99 (Arrowverse)|Earth-99]], where the latter fails to recruit an elderly crippled [[Bruce Wayne (Arrowverse Earth-99)|Bruce Wayne]], who became a killer. Bruce is in turn accidentally electrocuted in a heated confrontation with Kate and Kara. Elsewhere on [[Earth-18 (Arrowverse)|Earth-18]], Sara, Barry, Mia, and [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] take Oliver's body to a [[Lazarus Pit]] in an attempt to resurrect him, but the accumulating antimatter across the multiverse prevents them from bringing his soul back. Back on the ''Waverider'', the Monitor tasks Ray with building a \"Paragon detector\", which identifies Kate as the true \"Paragon of Courage\". Unbeknownst to everyone, Harbinger is secretly contacted by the Anti-Monitor.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 2 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Two |series=Batwoman |series-link=Batwoman (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=1 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]]'s help, Ray's \"Paragon detector\" identifies Barry as the \"Paragon of Love\", [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]] as the \"Paragon of Honor\", and [[Ivy Town (Arrowverse)|Ivy Town]] scientist [[Ryan Choi (Arrowverse)|Ryan Choi]] as the \"Paragon of Humanity\". Iris, Ray, and [[Ralph Dibny (Arrowverse)|Ralph Dibny]] attempt to recruit a reluctant Choi, who eventually complies when Iris assures him that ordinary people can be heroes too. After the Monitor restores Cisco's powers, he, Barry, and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] meet up with Pariah at the Anti-Monitor's chamber beneath Central City, where they find an anti-matter cannon powered by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Flash]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]]. When Cisco frees Barry-90, the cannon goes critical, so Pariah recruits Jefferson from his recently-destroyed Earth to contain the energy. Barry-1 volunteers to destroy the cannon, which would result in his prophesied death. However, Barry-90 stops him, claiming the Monitor did not specify which Flash would die in the Crisis and takes his place. Meanwhile, Constantine, Mia, and Diggle visit [[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer]] on [[Earth-666 (Arrowverse)|Earth-666]] to get his help in entering [[Purgatory]] and retrieve Oliver's soul. Before they can leave, [[Jim Corrigan]] appears and bestows the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s power onto Oliver. He accepts, and Constantine's team is returned to the ''Waverider'' without him. While the heroes regroup, the Anti-Monitor sends a brainwashed Harbinger to kill the Monitor so he can absorb his power and finish destroying the multiverse. Before the remaining heroes and Earth-1 are destroyed, Pariah sends the Paragons to the Vanishing Point to keep them safe, where they witness Lex replace Superman-96 with himself using a page from the Book of Destiny.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 3 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three |series=The Flash |series-link=The Flash (2014 TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=6 |number=9 |airdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a flashback to the planet Maltus 10,000 years ago, Mar Novu experiments with time-travel to witness the birth of the universe, only to accidentally end up in the antimatter universe and reveal the multiverse's existence to the Anti-Monitor. In the months since the multiverse was destroyed, the Paragons have struggled to survive at the Vanishing Point. Once Corrigan teaches him how to use the Spectre's power, Oliver heads to the Vanishing Point to rescue the Paragons and strengthen Barry's powers. With his increased speed, Barry drops off Kara, Choi, and Lex on Maltus, but loses everyone else across the Speed Force after being attacked by the Anti-Monitor. Despite an expected double-cross from Lex, Kara and Choi convince Novu not to go through with his plans. Once Barry retrieves everyone, they arrive at the dawn of time, only to learn the Anti-Monitor will always learn of the multiverse's existence as there will always be a version of Novu who cannot give up his ambitions. The Paragons battle the Anti-Monitor and his shadow demons until Oliver uses the Spectre's power to restore the multiverse, with the Paragons providing additional assistance via Lex's Book of Destiny page. As a result however, Oliver dies a second and final time in Barry and Sara's arms.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 4 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=8 |number=8 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWaking up in the newly-recreated universe, the Paragons discover they are the only ones who remember the Crisis and that both Earth-38 and Jefferson's Earth were merged with Earth-1 into a composite universe later designated as [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]], among other changes throughout the multiverse. While J'onn uses his psionic powers to bring their allies up to speed, Sara attempts to find Oliver, though without success. Later that night, the Paragons are attacked by shadow demons. A restored and remorseful Nash discovers that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and plotting to renew his destruction of the multiverse. To stop him once and for all, Nash, Ray, Barry, and Choi work to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity while the other heroes distract him. Once it is finished, Kara uses it on the Anti-Monitor, sending him to the microverse. Sometime later, Barry, Kara, Sara, Kate, Clark, J'onn, and Jefferson hold a memorial service for Oliver before agreeing to come together to protect their new world in his memory.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 5 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five |series=Legends of Tomorrow |series-link=Legends of Tomorrow |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=1 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of Supergirl characters|Supergirl]], [[List of Batwoman characters|Batwoman]], [[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

also|Arrowverse#Official crossover events}}\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was first hinted at in the Arrowverse in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319]] [[Arrowverse]] crossover,<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320]] crossover was already being discussed, with it already having \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said the producers for all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover,\"<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> while [[Marc Guggenheim]] stated \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for the it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title and premise as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain things in service of the forthcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> At that time, [[The CW]] President [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful ''Legends of Tomorrow'', which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications, would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event, spanning dates in both late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]]; this episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> When pitching the crossover to the studio and network early on, Guggenheim noted the creators stressed they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\", but to have the ability \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Speaking to the comparison of the crossover to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim felt \"for [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''\" adding, \"''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. \"Crisis\" is a semi-colon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n===Lead-up===\nIn May 2019, the season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' all featured teases for the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor making an appearance in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> Eric Wallace, showrunner of the sixth season of ''The Flash'', stated that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in service to the crossover's events. Wallace felt the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' with the villain [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the start of the season to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nThe majority of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season serves as a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with ''The Flash'' writers regarding the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', co-showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said the season would tease the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" He also highlighted the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]], [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother, as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, describing it as \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who portrays both the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover, the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him,\" adding, \"You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' featured an end tag scene with [[Nash Wells]] gaining access to a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", ahead of [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appearing in ''The Flash'' episode of the crossover. The episode saw red skies cover Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]], sending her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave eventually wipes them out, along with her Earth, except for Jefferson, who is teleported to an unknown location.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]], the writer of the 1985 original series, and Guggenheim, and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The issues also reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, with the second issue including material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). Speaking to the issues, Guggenheim said their conception \"came pretty early on in the process\" once it was realized the scope of the story would be more than the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" The four main characters of the comic are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]], and others.<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to include the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul instead because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\" so it felt like a main part of the story and not ancillary,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> adding, \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted exclusively in [[Walmart]] stores on December 15, 2019, with the second releasing on January 19, 2020, and releases in comic stores the month after.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The events of the comics occur during the first part of the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> The stories from both issues, plus behind-the-scenes extra, will be collected in a deluxe edition hardcover, set for release on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nEach part of the crossover was written by the following creative teams. The ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]] with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing the story,<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode,<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> and Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, with Eric Wallace conceiving the story.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to write the crossover. Guggenheim, who was the overall creative for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", began by creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". These moments were designed to be modular, meaning they could be moved between the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, the scheduling of actors, and other factors. This also helped determine the order each episode aired. Guggenheim's initial template was catered to ''Arrow'' being the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' being the fifth \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW then requested for ''The Flash'' to be the third hour, and after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\", leaving ''Batwoman'' as the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Within this, certain characters were considered \"integral\", while others would just make cameo appearances, should that actor be available to appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the individual writers then broke off to write each episode, before the group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments and moving moments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on their title character's scenes (for example, Supergirl's scenes on ''Batwoman'' were written by the ''Supergirl'' writers) to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] ensured the grounded tone of the series was kept to since it is \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> The story is considered \"a five-hour epic\" as opposed to individual episodes, but the title character of each series and characters appropriate for those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash''), were given highlights.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episodes' scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems, but since the Arrowverse does not have those, the crossover allowed the creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was further developed, after being teased at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in a way that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> The version of the Anti-Monitor that appears was also inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim stated the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, with the opening of the Arrowverse crossover showing the destruction of various parallel universes similarly to the comic's beginning.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Speaking to the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] from the comic storyline, Wallace conceded that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\" but a proper balance was found in killing some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Though it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover, which Guggenheim felt \"spoiled our own story\", his death in the first hour was done in an attempt to \"surprise the audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth. It was also done to \"establish the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> In the third hour, the death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\" without killing Gustin's character. Wallace thought this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while also \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was not originally scripted for inclusion, but was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies for a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Once again, this was done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\" according to Guggenheim, adding, \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nWith the inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover, it explored what happened to the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who portrays that series' Lois Lane, said, \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode, where the characters appear, was written by former writers on ''Smallville''. This allowed Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\" The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Despite having three actors who portray Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, there was never a scene written featuring all three. The writers wanted a clear distinction of [[Tom Welling]]'s character appearing at the Kent Farm and Routh's character appearing at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Guggenheim added, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live-action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was considered to be five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], who added, \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene was written by Certo, a fan of ''Lucifer'', and was sent to the creative team on ''Lucifer'' for their feedback. ''Lucifer'' co-showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, while Ellis contributed the bit of him saying \"Constantyne\" instead of \"Constantine\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\" since he wanted to participate once he knew the Arrowverse series were adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> The inclusion of Black Lightning in the crossover was decided \"very late in the game\" according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to figure out a way to incorporate the character in a way that would not be a simple cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". Once the logistics and creative elements were solved, having the character \"elevated the crossover to another level\". On the character's appearance, actor [[Cress Williams]] stated the character's entrance comes \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people.\" Williams added that because of this, there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; it was important to the writers that they could \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force, with Kate helping to break up the fight. The writers felt season six was \"relatively recent\", so they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode, one of Guggenheim's favorites, and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were also chosen based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". While in the Speed Force, Barry encountered [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics' Chief Creative Officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]]'s film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure it would not conflict with the planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar seen in the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover to a spot where the heroes could gather for future team-ups,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> along with a hint at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. These hints were a \"fun bit\" the writers knew they wanted to end the crossover on, with an early version of the scripts having the Wonder Twins make an appearance.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThough the early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising the role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not make an appearance. Guggenheim did not want to be beholden to this, pointing out that the newspaper headline mentioning him had been created by executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had also already featured prominently in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", was another character that appeared in early versions of the crossover. Ultimately, per Guggenheim, he was not included since \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics. This was \"a really important inclusion\" for Guggenheim, but \"for a variety of different reasons,\" it could not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett was upgraded to series regular status on all of the series, receiving the credit in the episodes he appears in before the crossover, to ensure he would have been available for \"Crisis\" and his appearances leading up to it.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> In July 2019 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], multiple castings for the crossover were announced. They included: [[Tyler Hoechlin]] reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]],<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> while [[Brandon Routh]], who portrays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman from the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), portraying \"an older, more world-weary\" version, inspired by the comics' [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]];<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh would portray [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], would appear in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell portraying multiple versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] reprising his role as Lex Luthor;<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett also portraying the Anti-Monitor in addition to the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly after, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was also confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nThe following month, at the [[Television Critics Association]], Pedowitz announced that cast members from the series ''Black Lightning'' would appear,<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> something star Cress Williams previously hinted at,<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and that Kevin Conroy would appear as an elderly Bruce Wayne, having previously voiced the character in multiple animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray the character in live action, having not done it previously. He also felt it would be an opportunity to satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', who also expressed interest in seeing Conroy portray the character on camera.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim also revealed the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. about the possibility of having [[Lynda Carter]] reprise her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|1975 television series]], but felt it was unlikely to happen.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\nIn September 2019, [[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]],<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and shortly after John Wesley Shipp was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Working on his series, Ellis \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and, 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", feeling \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection for the character.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In the middle of the month, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively, from ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance also returns to reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', revealed Warner Bros. and the producers approached him to reprise the role in \"Crisis\", but he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but he turned it down due to his scheduling conflicts with the series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> Ritchson does appear via archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> Later in the month, [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from the series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the start of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced to be reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], while also taking on the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] persona from the comics; Lyla previously used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The same month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> By that time, the producers had reached out to [[Nicolas Cage]], who at one point was attached to portray Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film, about appearing.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as [[Courtney Whitmore|<!--don't delink-->Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]], ahead of the release of [[Stargirl (TV series)|her series]] on the streaming service [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role of Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Despite production on the crossover being completed, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing, not wanting to do it if Gustin was not, and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" with the idea.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim also called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse for the Kent family farm took place at the end of the month.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> The farmhouse had previously been featured in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure his characterization was consistent with his series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Filming had completed by November 8, with some reshoots and minor filming having finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> Once Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' was used to film it since the ''Arrow'' crew had already wrapped on the series and was no longer around.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors on the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> These directors were hired specifically for the crossover, because of their previous experience working in the Arrowverse, allowing them to create a unified look, with help from their directors of photography. ''Batwoman'', which normally is filmed in a different [[aspect ratio]] than the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for a consistent look. Many of the stunt sequences, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]], along with his collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan, began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> with the score recorded by a live orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated many musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into his score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> some cues included the 1960s Batman television series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nAhead of the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired, and it was something each series \"have embraced\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim described it as \"it wasn't so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> He added that each series would be affected, outside of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" though there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Coming out of the crossover, Dries was looking to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounded nature established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the remainder of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\" and felt the Arrowverse ending was a \"game-changer\" that \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover, the universe had been rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}now existing on the newly established [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]; this was decided going into the crossover. A new multiverse was also created, with six of its Earths revealed.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Guggenheim said \"there is an opportunity going forward after \"Crisis\" to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Some of the changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter Sara returning to the timeline after being changed in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor having more heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after almost doing so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> For ''Batwoman'', the series sees Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice,<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> with Dries calling this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\n[[Boost Mobile]] served as a promotional partner for the event.<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> The first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teaser shorts.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the poster for the event was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> On November 24, 2019, a full trailer was released.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> A first long trailer for the event was released on December 3, 2019,<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /> and a second on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWith the release of the initial trailers in November, a logo for the event featuring the leading character from each of the series except Oliver Queen was revealed. Guggenheim claimed that, at that time, legal and financial reasons prevented them from including Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> However, with the release of the full trailer in December, Oliver was now included in the logo, which Guggenheim explained was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\" to allow the change to happen.<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> Guggenheim had been told \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", hence the initial exclusion of Amell because he does not appear in Part 5.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the final two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\", with different taglines used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a final trailer for the last two parts.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nThe crossover began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December

He called the episode \"accessible\" for any viewer and felt it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". Schedeen also felt the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\". The episode was also deemed \"a very critical episode for ''Arrow'' fans\" given Oliver's death by Schedeen, though he was upset that Barry did not have a large role to play in the episode.<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare]us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\" of the episode.<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the opening of the episode \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". Siede was happy \"Crisis\" was the first crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover {{em|and}} a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" She also pointed out the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\". She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Awarding the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, Kayti Burt from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\" and overall, felt the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" Speaking to the cast in the episode, Burt said, \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific,\" which led to \"one of the best scenes\" between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09|title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09|title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the Spectre. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\" especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08|title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character stating, \"These final two episodes more than justify the decision to resurrect Ollie after his heroic sacrifice in Part 1. They do even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" it what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out Oliver Queen\".<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.

[[Arrowverse]] [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event, featuring episodes of the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' on [[The CW]]. The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, while the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Additionally, events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\", airing between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash'', and a two-issue comic featuring characters and concepts unable to appear in the live-action episodes, tie into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which is inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". Moreover, the preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] served as a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several \"Paragons\" from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying all of reality. The crossover's events resulted in the Arrowverse's continuity being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014, with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", with the crossover title revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. In mid-2019, multiple castings were announced, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. \"Crisis\" also sees [[Cress Williams]] from fellow CW series ''Black Lightning'' appear and cross over with the Arrowverse for the first time, along with actors reprising their roles from various DC film and television series. Filming took place from the end of September 2019 until the beginning of November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming Crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect various items.<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> The former also retrieves the cadaver of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the Crisis date has moved up to December 2019 and that to save billions, the Flash must die.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> To learn more about what happens to him, Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse.

Clark and Lois narrowly send their son [[Jonathan Kent (Arrowverse)|Jonathan]] off into an escape pod just as the wave wipes out Argo alongside Alura. Harbinger brings Barry, [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Kate Kane]], [[Sara Lance]] and [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] to Earth-38, while also rescuing the Kents from Argo. Harbinger briefs the gathered heroes on the threat of the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] as the Monitor raises a quantum tower to impede the antimatter wave while the [[Department of Extranormal Operations (Arrowverse)|DEO]] and [[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena Luthor]] work to evacuate Earth-38's inhabitants to [[Earth-1 (Arrowverse)|Earth-1]]. Brainy locates Jonathan's pod on [[Earth-16 (Arrowverse)|Earth-16]], so he, Lois, and Sara leave to retrieve him while the others stay behind to fend off the Anti-Monitor's forces. In preparation for his death, Oliver passes the mantle of Green Arrow to Mia. When he learns Barry is fated to die however, he argues with the Monitor over the deal they made last year.{{efn|As depicted in the 2018 crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\".}} The heroes make their stand at the tower and fend off an army of shadow demons until the Monitor teleports them off-world, deeming the battle to be lost. Refusing to leave, Oliver temporarily nullifies the Monitor and stays behind to ensure the exodus succeeds. Back on Earth-1, Lois' team returns with Jonathan before the Monitor brings a dying Oliver to say good-bye, commenting that this was not how he was supposed to die. Nash, now a \"Pariah\" for releasing the Anti-Monitor, appears and announces that events have changed and everything is doomed.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 1 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One |series=Supergirl |series-link=Supergirl (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=9 |airdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the Earth-1 [[Legends of Tomorrow (Arrowverse team)|Legends]] unavailable, Harbinger recruits [[Earth-74 (Arrowverse)|Earth-74]]'s [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] so the heroes can use his ''Waverider'' as their base of operations. In the wake of Oliver's death, which he cannot undo because of the Anti-Monitor's growing power, the Monitor consults the Book of Destiny and learns of seven Paragons who could turn the tide; the \"Paragon of Hope\", Kara; the \"Paragon of Destiny\", Sara; the \"Paragon of Truth\", a Superman who has suffered \"more than any mortal man\"; and the \"Paragon of Courage\", who is described as the \"Bat of the Future\". Clark, Lois, and Iris locate the second Superman on [[Earth-96 (Arrowverse)|Earth-96]], though Lex uses the Book of Destiny to mind-control that Earth's Clark until Lois knocks Lex out. Kara and Kate travel to [[Earth-99 (Arrowverse)|Earth-99]], where the latter fails to recruit an elderly crippled [[Bruce Wayne (Arrowverse Earth-99)|Bruce Wayne]], who became a killer. Bruce is in turn accidentally electrocuted in a heated confrontation with Kate and Kara. Elsewhere on [[Earth-18 (Arrowverse)|Earth-18]], Sara, Barry, Mia, and [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] take Oliver's body to a [[Lazarus Pit]] in an attempt to resurrect him, but the accumulating antimatter across the multiverse prevents them from bringing his soul back. Back on the ''Waverider'', the Monitor tasks Ray with building a \"Paragon detector\", which identifies Kate as the true \"Paragon of Courage\". Unbeknownst to everyone, Harbinger is secretly contacted by the Anti-Monitor.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 2 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Two |series=Batwoman |series-link=Batwoman (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=1 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]]'s help, Ray's \"Paragon detector\" identifies Barry as the \"Paragon of Love\", [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]] as the \"Paragon of Honor\", and [[Ivy Town (Arrowverse)|Ivy Town]] scientist [[Ryan Choi (Arrowverse)|Ryan Choi]] as the \"Paragon of Humanity\". Iris, Ray, and [[Ralph Dibny (Arrowverse)|Ralph Dibny]] attempt to recruit a reluctant Choi, who eventually complies when Iris assures him that ordinary people can be heroes too. After the Monitor restores Cisco's powers, he, Barry, and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] meet up with Pariah at the Anti-Monitor's chamber beneath Central City, where they find an anti-matter cannon powered by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Flash]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]]. When Cisco frees Barry-90, the cannon goes critical, so Pariah recruits Jefferson from his recently-destroyed Earth to contain the energy. Barry-1 volunteers to destroy the cannon, which would result in his prophesied death. However, Barry-90 stops him, claiming the Monitor did not specify which Flash would die in the Crisis and takes his place. Meanwhile, Constantine, Mia, and Diggle visit [[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer]] on [[Earth-666 (Arrowverse)|Earth-666]] to get his help in entering [[Purgatory]] and retrieve Oliver's soul. Before they can leave, [[Jim Corrigan]] appears and bestows the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s power onto Oliver. He accepts, and Constantine's team is returned to the ''Waverider'' without him. While the heroes regroup, the Anti-Monitor sends a brainwashed Harbinger to kill the Monitor so he can absorb his power and finish destroying the multiverse. Before the remaining heroes and Earth-1 are destroyed, Pariah sends the Paragons to the Vanishing Point to keep them safe, where they witness Lex replace Superman-96 with himself using a page from the Book of Destiny.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 3 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three |series=The Flash |series-link=The Flash (2014 TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=6 |number=9 |airdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a flashback to the planet Maltus 10,000 years ago, Mar Novu experiments with time-travel to witness the birth of the universe, only to accidentally end up in the antimatter universe and reveal the multiverse's existence to the Anti-Monitor. In the months since the multiverse was destroyed, the Paragons have struggled to survive at the Vanishing Point. Once Corrigan teaches him how to use the Spectre's power, Oliver heads to the Vanishing Point to rescue the Paragons and strengthen Barry's powers. With his increased speed, Barry drops off Kara, Choi, and Lex on Maltus, but loses everyone else across the Speed Force after being attacked by the Anti-Monitor. Despite an expected double-cross from Lex, Kara and Choi convince Novu not to go through with his plans. Once Barry retrieves everyone, they arrive at the dawn of time, only to learn the Anti-Monitor will always learn of the multiverse's existence as there will always be a version of Novu who cannot give up his ambitions. The Paragons battle the Anti-Monitor and his shadow demons until Oliver uses the Spectre's power to restore the multiverse, with the Paragons providing additional assistance via Lex's Book of Destiny page. As a result however, Oliver dies a second and final time in Barry and Sara's arms.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 4 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=8 |number=8 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWaking up in the newly-recreated universe, the Paragons discover they are the only ones who remember the Crisis and that both Earth-38 and Jefferson's Earth were merged with Earth-1 into a composite universe later designated as [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]], among other changes throughout the multiverse. While J'onn uses his psionic powers to bring their allies up to speed, Sara attempts to find Oliver, though without success. Later that night, the Paragons are attacked by shadow demons. A restored and remorseful Nash discovers that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and plotting to renew his destruction of the multiverse. To stop him once and for all, Nash, Ray, Barry, and Choi work to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity while the other heroes distract him. Once it is finished, Kara uses it on the Anti-Monitor, sending him to the microverse. Sometime later, Barry, Kara, Sara, Kate, Clark, J'onn, and Jefferson hold a memorial service for Oliver before agreeing to come together to protect their new world in his memory.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 5 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five |series=Legends of Tomorrow |series-link=Legends of Tomorrow |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=1 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of Supergirl characters|Supergirl]], [[List of Batwoman characters|Batwoman]], [[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

also|Arrowverse#Official crossover events}}\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was first hinted at in the Arrowverse in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319]] [[Arrowverse]] crossover,<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320]] crossover was already being discussed, with it already having \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said the producers for all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover,\"<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> while [[Marc Guggenheim]] stated \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for the it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title and premise as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain things in service of the forthcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> At that time, [[The CW]] President [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful ''Legends of Tomorrow'', which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications, would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event, spanning dates in both late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]]; this episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> When pitching the crossover to the studio and network early on, Guggenheim noted the creators stressed they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\", but to have the ability \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Speaking to the comparison of the crossover to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim felt \"for [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''\" adding, \"''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. \"Crisis\" is a semi-colon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n===Lead-up===\nIn May 2019, the season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' all featured teases for the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor making an appearance in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> Eric Wallace, showrunner of the sixth season of ''The Flash'', stated that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in service to the crossover's events. Wallace felt the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' with the villain [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the start of the season to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nThe majority of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season serves as a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with ''The Flash'' writers regarding the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', co-showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said the season would tease the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" He also highlighted the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]], [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother, as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, describing it as \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who portrays both the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover, the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him,\" adding, \"You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' featured an end tag scene with [[Nash Wells]] gaining access to a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", ahead of [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appearing in ''The Flash'' episode of the crossover. The episode saw red skies cover Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]], sending her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave eventually wipes them out, along with her Earth, except for Jefferson, who is teleported to an unknown location.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]], the writer of the 1985 original series, and Guggenheim, and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The issues also reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, with the second issue including material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). Speaking to the issues, Guggenheim said their conception \"came pretty early on in the process\" once it was realized the scope of the story would be more than the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" The four main characters of the comic are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]], and others.<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to include the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul instead because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\" so it felt like a main part of the story and not ancillary,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> adding, \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted exclusively in [[Walmart]] stores on December 15, 2019, with the second releasing on January 19, 2020, and releases in comic stores the month after.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The events of the comics occur during the first part of the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> The stories from both issues, plus behind-the-scenes extra, will be collected in a deluxe edition hardcover, set for release on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nEach part of the crossover was written by the following creative teams. The ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]] with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing the story,<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode,<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> and Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, with Eric Wallace conceiving the story.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to write the crossover. Guggenheim, who was the overall creative for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", began by creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". These moments were designed to be modular, meaning they could be moved between the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, the scheduling of actors, and other factors. This also helped determine the order each episode aired. Guggenheim's initial template was catered to ''Arrow'' being the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' being the fifth \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW then requested for ''The Flash'' to be the third hour, and after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\", leaving ''Batwoman'' as the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Within this, certain characters were considered \"integral\", while others would just make cameo appearances, should that actor be available to appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the individual writers then broke off to write each episode, before the group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments and moving moments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on their title character's scenes (for example, Supergirl's scenes on ''Batwoman'' were written by the ''Supergirl'' writers) to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] ensured the grounded tone of the series was kept to since it is \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> The story is considered \"a five-hour epic\" as opposed to individual episodes, but the title character of each series and characters appropriate for those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash''), were given highlights.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episodes' scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems, but since the Arrowverse does not have those, the crossover allowed the creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was further developed, after being teased at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in a way that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> The version of the Anti-Monitor that appears was also inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim stated the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, with the opening of the Arrowverse crossover showing the destruction of various parallel universes similarly to the comic's beginning.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Speaking to the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] from the comic storyline, Wallace conceded that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\" but a proper balance was found in killing some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Though it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover, which Guggenheim felt \"spoiled our own story\", his death in the first hour was done in an attempt to \"surprise the audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth. It was also done to \"establish the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> In the third hour, the death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\" without killing Gustin's character. Wallace thought this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while also \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was not originally scripted for inclusion, but was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies for a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Once again, this was done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\" according to Guggenheim, adding, \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nWith the inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover, it explored what happened to the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who portrays that series' Lois Lane, said, \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode, where the characters appear, was written by former writers on ''Smallville''. This allowed Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\" The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Despite having three actors who portray Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, there was never a scene written featuring all three. The writers wanted a clear distinction of [[Tom Welling]]'s character appearing at the Kent Farm and Routh's character appearing at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Guggenheim added, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live-action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was considered to be five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], who added, \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene was written by Certo, a fan of ''Lucifer'', and was sent to the creative team on ''Lucifer'' for their feedback. ''Lucifer'' co-showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, while Ellis contributed the bit of him saying \"Constantyne\" instead of \"Constantine\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\" since he wanted to participate once he knew the Arrowverse series were adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> The inclusion of Black Lightning in the crossover was decided \"very late in the game\" according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to figure out a way to incorporate the character in a way that would not be a simple cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". Once the logistics and creative elements were solved, having the character \"elevated the crossover to another level\". On the character's appearance, actor [[Cress Williams]] stated the character's entrance comes \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people.\" Williams added that because of this, there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; it was important to the writers that they could \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force, with Kate helping to break up the fight. The writers felt season six was \"relatively recent\", so they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode, one of Guggenheim's favorites, and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were also chosen based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". While in the Speed Force, Barry encountered [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics' Chief Creative Officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]]'s film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure it would not conflict with the planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar seen in the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover to a spot where the heroes could gather for future team-ups,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> along with a hint at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. These hints were a \"fun bit\" the writers knew they wanted to end the crossover on, with an early version of the scripts having the Wonder Twins make an appearance.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThough the early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising the role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not make an appearance. Guggenheim did not want to be beholden to this, pointing out that the newspaper headline mentioning him had been created by executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had also already featured prominently in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", was another character that appeared in early versions of the crossover. Ultimately, per Guggenheim, he was not included since \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics. This was \"a really important inclusion\" for Guggenheim, but \"for a variety of different reasons,\" it could not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett was upgraded to series regular status on all of the series, receiving the credit in the episodes he appears in before the crossover, to ensure he would have been available for \"Crisis\" and his appearances leading up to it.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> In July 2019 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], multiple castings for the crossover were announced. They included: [[Tyler Hoechlin]] reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]],<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> while [[Brandon Routh]], who portrays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman from the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), portraying \"an older, more world-weary\" version, inspired by the comics' [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]];<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh would portray [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], would appear in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell portraying multiple versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] reprising his role as Lex Luthor;<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett also portraying the Anti-Monitor in addition to the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly after, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was also confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nThe following month, at the [[Television Critics Association]], Pedowitz announced that cast members from the series ''Black Lightning'' would appear,<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> something star Cress Williams previously hinted at,<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and that Kevin Conroy would appear as an elderly Bruce Wayne, having previously voiced the character in multiple animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray the character in live action, having not done it previously. He also felt it would be an opportunity to satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', who also expressed interest in seeing Conroy portray the character on camera.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim also revealed the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. about the possibility of having [[Lynda Carter]] reprise her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|1975 television series]], but felt it was unlikely to happen.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\nIn September 2019, [[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]],<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and shortly after John Wesley Shipp was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Working on his series, Ellis \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and, 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", feeling \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection for the character.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In the middle of the month, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively, from ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance also returns to reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', revealed Warner Bros. and the producers approached him to reprise the role in \"Crisis\", but he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but he turned it down due to his scheduling conflicts with the series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> Ritchson does appear via archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> Later in the month, [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from the series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the start of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced to be reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], while also taking on the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] persona from the comics; Lyla previously used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The same month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> By that time, the producers had reached out to [[Nicolas Cage]], who at one point was attached to portray Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film, about appearing.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as [[Courtney Whitmore|<!--don't delink-->Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]], ahead of the release of [[Stargirl (TV series)|her series]] on the streaming service [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role of Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Despite production on the crossover being completed, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing, not wanting to do it if Gustin was not, and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" with the idea.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim also called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse for the Kent family farm took place at the end of the month.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> The farmhouse had previously been featured in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure his characterization was consistent with his series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Filming had completed by November 8, with some reshoots and minor filming having finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> Once Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' was used to film it since the ''Arrow'' crew had already wrapped on the series and was no longer around.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors on the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> These directors were hired specifically for the crossover, because of their previous experience working in the Arrowverse, allowing them to create a unified look, with help from their directors of photography. ''Batwoman'', which normally is filmed in a different [[aspect ratio]] than the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for a consistent look. Many of the stunt sequences, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]], along with his collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan, began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> with the score recorded by a live orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated many musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into his score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> some cues included the 1960s Batman television series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nAhead of the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired, and it was something each series \"have embraced\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim described it as \"it wasn't so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> He added that each series would be affected, outside of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" though there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Coming out of the crossover, Dries was looking to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounded nature established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the remainder of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\" and felt the Arrowverse ending was a \"game-changer\" that \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover, the universe had been rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}now existing on the newly established [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]; this was decided going into the crossover. A new multiverse was also created, with six of its Earths revealed.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Guggenheim said \"there is an opportunity going forward after \"Crisis\" to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Some of the changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter Sara returning to the timeline after being changed in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor having more heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after almost doing so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> For ''Batwoman'', the series sees Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice,<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> with Dries calling this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\nThe first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> [[Boost Mobile]] served as a promotional partner for the event.<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teaser shorts.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the poster for the event was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> On November 24, 2019, a full trailer was released.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> A first long trailer for the event was released on December 3, 2019,<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /> and a second on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWith the release of the initial trailers in November, a logo for the event featuring the leading character from each of the series except Oliver Queen was revealed. Guggenheim claimed that, at that time, legal and financial reasons prevented them from including Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> However, with the release of the full trailer in December, Oliver was now included in the logo, which Guggenheim explained was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\" to allow the change to happen.<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> After the crossover concluded, Guggenheim said he had been told \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", hence the initial exclusion of Amell because he does not appear in Part 5.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the final two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released.

response===\n====''Supergirl''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 13 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09|title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the first hour a 9 out of 10. He called the episode \"accessible\" for any viewer and felt it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". Schedeen also felt the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\". The episode was also deemed \"a very critical episode for ''Arrow'' fans\" given Oliver's death by Schedeen, though he was upset that Barry did not have a large role to play in the episode.<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare]us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\" of the episode.<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the opening of the episode \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". Siede was happy \"Crisis\" was the first crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover {{em|and}} a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" She also pointed out the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\". She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Awarding the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, Kayti Burt from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\" and overall, felt the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" Speaking to the cast in the episode, Burt said, \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific,\" which led to \"one of the best scenes\" between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09|title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09|title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the Spectre. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\" especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08|title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character stating, \"These final two episodes more than justify the decision to resurrect Ollie after his heroic sacrifice in Part 1. They do even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" it what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out Oliver Queen\".<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special.
