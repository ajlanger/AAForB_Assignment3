Persico]], that tells the story of the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part one===\nAt the close of [[World War II]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) surrenders to the Americans and enjoys the hospitality of a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] base. [[Samuel Rosenman]] ([[Max von Sydow]]), acting on the orders of [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], recruits [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) to prepare a war crimes tribunal against G\u00f6ring and the surviving [[Nazi]] leadership. G\u00f6ring, [[Albert Speer]] ([[Herbert Knaup]]) and others are arrested for [[war crime]]s and imprisoned in a [[U.S. Army]] stockade at [[Mondorf-les-Bains|Bad Mondorf]] in [[Luxembourg]]. Jackson, his assistant Elsie Douglas ([[Jill Hennessy]]), and his prosecution team fly to [[Germany]].  Psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] ([[Matt Craven]]) arrives at the stockade with prisoner [[Hans Frank]] (Frank Moore), who has attempted [[suicide]].\n\nJackson negotiates with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] representatives [[David Maxwell-Fyfe|Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] ([[Christopher Plummer]]), General [[Iona Nikitchenko]] (Len Doncheff) and [[Henri Donnedieu de Vabres]] ([[Paul H\u00e9bert]]) to ensure a unified prosecution. Jackson selects the [[Nuremberg Palace of Justice]] for the site of the trials and reconstruction work commences. G\u00f6ring and the others are stripped of their rank and transferred to the prison in [[Nuremberg]], where they come into conflict with the guards under the command of the strict Colonel [[Burton C. Andrus]] ([[Michael Ironside]]). Major [[Airey Neave]] (Geoffrey Pounsett) serves G\u00f6ring, Speer and the others with their indictments. U.S. judge [[Francis Biddle]] ([[Len Cariou]]) arrives to take control of the court but reluctantly passes the honour at Jackson's insistence. Following the [[suicide]] of prisoner [[Robert Ley]] ([[Julien Poulin]]), round-the-clock watches are posted and Gilbert is appointed prisoner liaison.\n\n[[Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey|Sir Geoffrey Lawrence]] (David Francis) opens the trial with all defendants pleading not guilty, and Jackson gives a stirring opening statement. At lunch a jovial G\u00f6ring holds court over the other defendants while Speer begins to show signs of remorse. Maxwell-Fyfe puts forward an emotive eyewitness account of the Nazis' [[genocide|genocidal]] policies toward [[Jew]]s and others, while Jackson reads out dry documentation. As the court begins to tire of Jackson's meticulous approach, Maxwell-Fyfe urges pushing on to the witness interviews, which reveal the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camps]]. The court is shaken by documentary footage of the camps; even G\u00f6ring appears unsettled.\n\n===Part two===\nSpeer explains G\u00f6ring's dominance to Gilbert and insists that his control over the others must be broken. G\u00f6ring takes the stand and begins speaking to the [[German people]]. Jackson, at Gilbert's suggestion, has G\u00f6ring isolated. Under [[cross-examination]], G\u00f6ring outmaneuvers and humiliates Jackson, who later accuses Biddle of giving G\u00f6ring free rein in court. Douglas talks Jackson out of tendering his resignation, and the two share a kiss. Under advice from Maxwell-Fyfe, Jackson returns to confront G\u00f6ring with evidence of his crimes against the Jews and successfully dismisses the defendant\u2019s denials.\n\nAt a [[Christmas]] party, the German housekeeper refuses to serve the [[Soviet]]s, but Douglas rescues the situation before slipping away with Jackson. Gilbert visits the defendants and, under Jackson's advice, attempts to convince them to take responsibility for their crimes. Andrus relaxes the prison rules for Christmas, and G\u00f6ring shares a friendly drink with his guard, Lt. Tex Wheelis (Scott Gibson). The cross-examination of the defendants intensifies and the defence calls [[Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]] ([[Colm Feore]]), who casually reveals the horrors of [[Auschwitz]]. Speer is implicated in the [[slavery|enslavement]] of foreign workers by fellow defendant [[Fritz Sauckel]] ([[Ken Kramer]]) and in response accepts collective responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.\n\nGilbert interviews G\u00f6ring's wife [[Emmy G\u00f6ring|Emmy]] ([[Susan Glover]]), who reveals that [[Hitler]] had ordered them all executed, which led to the family's surrender. Jackson is moved by Gilbert's [[summation]] of his examinations \u2014 that the source of the evil behind [[Nazi Germany]] was a complete lack of [[empathy]] \u2014 to give an impassioned closing statement. G\u00f6ring uses his final statement to condemn the trial, and is sentenced along with several others to death by [[hanging]]. Speer uses his final statement to commend the tribunal and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. G\u00f6ring commits [[suicide]] after his request to be executed by [[firing squad]] is denied. Andrus presides over the executions of the others while Jackson and Douglas head home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alec Baldwin]] as Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H.

In reality, G\u00f6ring, after sending an aide to Brigadier General Robert I. Stack in which he offered to surrender to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] personally, was discovered and arrested in a traffic jam near [[Radstadt]] by a detachment of the [[Seventh United States Army]], which was sent through the German lines to find him and bring him to a secure American position, on 6 May 1945.<ref>The 36th Infantry Division Association Library</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Keitel]] was described in the film as an admiral during the defendants' sentencing. He was in fact a field marshal and would not have been identified with naval rank. However, he is correctly addressed as field marshal in other parts of the film.\n\nIn the film Jackson describes the Nuremberg's Justice Palace as \"the same building where Nuremberg Laws were decreed to deprive all the German Jews all of their rights\". In reality, the Nuremberg Laws were introduced by the Reichstag at a special meeting at the annual Nuremberg Rally of the NSDAP. Nuremberg's Justice Palace was, as it has always been, a regional court for the local area and the building had no association with the annual Party Rally during the Nazi era.\n\nJustice Jackson is portrayed as initially failing in his cross-examination of G\u04e7ring and emerging triumphant on the second day. In reality, the cross-examination was a disaster and severely damaged Jackson's reputation. This situation was recovered by Maxwell Fyfe.\n\nThe verdicts and sentences were pronounced together with all defendants present. In reality, verdicts and sentences were pronounced separately and the defendants were called one at a time into the courtroom to learn their sentence. Andrus was not present at the executions.\n\nWhen the defendants were indicted by Major Neave they all made verbal statements. In reality these statements were collected by Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]]. He asked the defendants to write their first reactions on a copy of the indictments.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974).</ref>\n\nIn the film [[Albert Speer]] was arrested when he was giving a lecture to American soldiers. In reality Speer was arrested together with [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Alfred Jodl]] in [[Flensburg]] where they had set up a provisional government.<ref>Richard Overy, ''Interrogations. The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945'' (2001).</ref>\n\nIn the film Captain Gilbert is graciously given the right to talk to the prisoners by Col. Andrus in exchange for a library and an exercise field. In reality Gilbert was specifically appointed to talk to the prisoners by the US military. The idea was that Andrus was informed by Gilbert about the state of mind of the prisoners.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974) page 3.</ref>\n\nThe tribunal is depicted as having four judges. In reality, there were eight, a senior and a junior from each of the four Allied powers.\n\nDuring the sentencing [[Wilhelm Keitel]] is referred to as Admiral, while he was actually a ''Generalfeldmarschall''\n\nG\u00f6ring's suicide is discovered when the guards come for Joachim von Ribbentrop when in real life, G\u00f6ring himself was to go first. Ribbentrop only went first after G\u00f6ring's suicide.\n\nAt the executions, the condemned state their names on the gallows and make their final statements in English. In reality, the condemned said their names before marching to the gallows and spoke in German, with an interpreter on the gallows. In addition, all executions appear to be carried out correctly. In real life, some of the hangings were reportedly botched as witnesses say not all of the executed Nazis fell with enough force to break the neck, and the trap door was too small causing bleeding head injuries to some of the men, as shown in pictures of the bodies.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Award!!Category!!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[53rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries|Outstanding Miniseries]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]]\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Outstanding Single Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Movie\n|Won\n|-\n|Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[58th Golden Globe Awards]]\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film|Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[7th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated [[Alec Baldwin]]\n|-\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"12\"|16th [[Gemini Awards]]\n|Best Dramatic Mini-Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated (Yves Simoneau)\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|  Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Original Music Score for a Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Production Design or Art Direction in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Achievement in Make-Up\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Costume Design\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Overall Sound in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Sound Editing in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Won\n|-\n|2001 [[PGA Awards]]\n|Television Producer of the Year Award in Longform\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2001 [[Satellite Awards]]\n|Best Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Won ([[Jill Hennessy]])\n|}\n\n==Streaming==\nAs of 2017 part 1 & 2 was released online on Canada Media Fund's Encore+ YouTube channel.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0208629|Nuremberg}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1102961-nuremberg}}\n{{Yves Simoneau}}\n\n[[Category:2000s Canadian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Docudramas]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yves Simoneau]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Holocaust films]]\n[[Category:World War II television drama series]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg in fiction]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg trials]]\n[[Category:Gemini and Canadian Screen Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries winners]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian television miniseries]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name      = Nuremberg\n|image          = Nuremberg (2000 film).jpg\n|caption        = \n|aka            = \n|genre          = [[Docudrama]]\n|creator        = \n|writer         = David W.

In reality these statements were collected by Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]]. He asked the defendants to write their first reactions on a copy of the indictments.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974).</ref>\n\nIn the film [[Albert Speer]] was arrested when he was giving a lecture to American soldiers. In reality Speer was arrested together with [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Alfred Jodl]] in [[Flensburg]] where they had set up a provisional government.<ref>Richard Overy, ''Interrogations. The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945'' (2001).</ref>\n\nIn the film Captain Gilbert is graciously given the right to talk to the prisoners by Col. Andrus in exchange for a library and an exercise field. In reality Gilbert was specifically appointed to talk to the prisoners by the US military. The idea was that Andrus was informed by Gilbert about the state of mind of the prisoners.<ref>G.M. Gilbert, ''Nuremberg diaries'', (New York 1974) page 3.</ref>\n\nThe tribunal is depicted as having four judges. In reality, there were eight, a senior and a junior from each of the four Allied powers.\n\nG\u00f6ring's suicide is discovered when the guards come for Joachim von Ribbentrop when in real life, G\u00f6ring himself was to go first. Ribbentrop only went first after G\u00f6ring's suicide.\n\nAt the executions, the condemned state their names on the gallows and make their final statements in English. In reality, the condemned said their names before marching to the gallows and spoke in German, with an interpreter on the gallows. In addition, all executions appear to be carried out correctly. In real life, some of the hangings were reportedly botched as witnesses say not all of the executed Nazis fell with enough force to break the neck, and the trap door was too small causing bleeding head injuries to some of the men, as shown in pictures of the bodies.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Award!!Category!!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[53rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries|Outstanding Miniseries]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]]\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Outstanding Single Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Movie\n|Won\n|-\n|Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[58th Golden Globe Awards]]\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film|Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television]]\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[7th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated [[Alec Baldwin]]\n|-\n|Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film\n|Nominated ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|rowspan=\"12\"|16th [[Gemini Awards]]\n|Best Dramatic Mini-Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated (Yves Simoneau)\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated ([[Alec Baldwin]])\n|-\n|  Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Won ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\n|-\n|Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Original Music Score for a Program or Mini-Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Production Design or Art Direction in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Won\n|-\n|Best Achievement in Make-Up\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Costume Design\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Overall Sound in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Sound Editing in a Dramatic Program or Series\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Won\n|-\n|2001 [[PGA Awards]]\n|Television Producer of the Year Award in Longform\n|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2001 [[Satellite Awards]]\n|Best Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television\n|Won ([[Jill Hennessy]])\n|}\n\n==Streaming==\nAs of 2017 part 1 & 2 was released online on Canada Media Fund's Encore+ YouTube channel.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0208629|Nuremberg}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1102961-nuremberg}}\n{{Yves Simoneau}}\n\n[[Category:2000s Canadian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Docudramas]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yves Simoneau]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Holocaust films]]\n[[Category:World War II television drama series]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg in fiction]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg trials]]\n[[Category:Gemini and Canadian Screen Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries winners]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian television miniseries]]\n", "name_user": "Bramvr", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistorical inaccuracies:Addition of inaccurate rank for Wilhelm Keitel", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_(miniseries)"}
