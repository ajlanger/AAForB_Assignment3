After five days, 200 Muslims gathered near Bawa Rahan shrine in the north of the town. The police approached but were unable to stop the mob. The mob attacked Dastur Kamdin Dar-e Mihr, a fire temple, and killed its High Priest, Ervad Ardeshir Hormazdji Kamdin. They lynched Bejonji Sheriaiji Bharucha and dragged his body for several lanes. They also attacked Shapurji Narielwala Fire Temple (consecrated in 1783) and also injured its High Priest, Ervad Meherwanji Muncherji Kamdin. Mr. Davies, the Megistrate of Bharuch and the Collector, could not stop the riots. The troops were brought in from nearby towns of Vagra, [[Amod, India|Amod]], [[Ankleshwar]] and [[Hansot]]. Lt. Richardson led the British contingent sent to bring the peace.<ref name=\"GBP\">{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Gujarat: Surat and Broach|url=https://archive.org/details/gazetteerbombay04unkngoog|year=1877|publisher=Government Central Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gazetteerbombay04unkngoog/page/n503 476]\u2013477}}</ref><ref name=\"WilliamsStewart2016\"/><ref name=\"KamerkarDhunjisha2002\">{{cite book|author1=Mani Kamerkar|author2=Soonu Dhunjisha|author3=K.R.
