It was first shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 9 October 1971 to 6 November 1983, hosted by [[Nicholas Parsons]]. Special ''Celebrity Sale of the Century'' editions aired occasionally, starting on 2 January 1981 with [[Steve Jones (game show presenter)|Steve Jones]] as host.\n\nThe first series was aired only in the Anglia region, but it rolled out to other regions by 8 January 1972 and achieved full national coverage by 10 May 1975, at which point it was one of the most popular shows on the network \u2013 spawning the often-mocked introductory phrase \"And now, from [[Norwich]], it's the quiz of the week\". Since Norwich was considered a backwater compared to [[London]], it was often used ironically.\n\nIt has been revived twice: first on [[Sky 1|Sky Channel]] from 6 February 1989 to 3 October 1991 hosted by [[Peter Marshall (UK broadcaster)|Peter Marshall]] and then on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge TV]] in 1997 hosted by [[Keith Chegwin]].\n\n==Rules (1971\u20131983; 1997)==\nThe ITV and Challenge versions followed the rules of the original American version. Three contestants start off with \u00a315 (\u00a310 in the earliest series). Questions are worth different values starting with \u00a31, increasing to \u00a33 after the second instant bargain, and finally \u00a35 after the fourth; by the final two ITV series, the values started at \u00a33 but increased to \u00a35 after the fourth instant bargain. The question is asked and players can buzz in at any time. Correct answers add the money to their score and incorrect answers subtract the money from their score with only one player allowed to buzz in on each question. If a contestant runs out of money at any time, they are eliminated from further play, but may remain in their seat for the remainder of the show.\n\n===Instant Bargain and Instant Sale===\nAt four points during gameplay (later five), all contestants would be offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The first player to buzz in after the prize was revealed purchased that prize. (In so doing, a \"losing\" contestant might not advance to go shopping at the end of the show, but could leave the show with a considerable haul for one day's play.) In the early days, the prices of all prizes offered were expressed much as one would hear in a department store (e.g., \u00a37.95, \u00a311.95, \u00a314.95, \u00a321.95). All prize values were rounded off to the nearest pound before being subtracted from the score of the player who purchased the prize (later on, prizes were in full pounds, like \u00a38, \u00a312, \u00a315, \u00a322, and increased as the show progressed). Each instant bargain was hidden behind a curtain; the announcer would mention the price, and then the curtain would open as the prize was revealed. If a contestant buzzed in before the curtain opened, it was declared \"No Sale\", the contestant would have the price deducted from his/her score (but not win the prize), and the other contestants could then buzz in.\n\nAlso during the early ITV series, an \"Open Sale\" was offered just before the commercial break, in which a number of smaller gifts were offered for less than \u00a35 each. In this situation, more than one player could buy a given gift, and a player could buy any or all of the prizes on offer.  They could even buy two or more of some items. By 1982, Open Sale had been replaced by an instant bargain.\n\nThe Challenge TV version kept the rules of the ITV version, except there was no \"Open Sale\", and players were spotted \u00a315 to start. There were five rounds with questions being worth \u00a31 in round one, \u00a33 in rounds two and three, and \u00a35 in rounds four and five. Finally, the game ended with 60 seconds of \u00a35 questions. The player in the lead at the end of this round was declared the champion.\n\n==Rules (1989\u20131991)==\nThe Sky Channel version had rules that were based on Australia's 1980\u20131988 format and America's 1983\u20131989 format, with better prizes than before.\n\nIn this format, each player started with \u00a320, and each question was worth only \u00a35.\n\nThere were only three \"Instant Sales\" (renamed Gift Shops), and only the player in the lead could buy.\n\nThe biggest change was the \"Fame Game\": Here, a succession of increasingly larger clues were given to the identity of a famous person, place, or event. In this round, players could buzz-in and answer at any time, with the player shut out for the remainder of the question if they gave an incorrect answer.\n\nIf one of the players buzzed-in and answered correctly, the contestant chose from a game board with nine squares. If all three contestants failed to come up with a right answer, then nobody got to pick. Once chosen, the space selected would be spun around to reveal either a relatively small prize (typically appliances or furniture valued at around a weekly wage) or a bonus money card, which added to the player's score.\n\nThere were \u00a310, \u00a315, and \u00a325 bonuses added each round; in addition, in the third round was a \"Wild Card\", which offered the choice of \u00a3100 or a chance to pick again.\n\nThe game ended with the Speed Round where the host would ask as many questions as possible within 60 seconds. The player with the most money when time ran out won the game.\n\nIf there was a tie for the lead after the Speed Round, another question was asked of the tied players. Answering this question awarded \u00a35 and the win; missing the question deducted \u00a35 and lost the game.\n\n==Shopping==\nThe winning contestant would be given the opportunity to spend their cash total on at least one of four grand prizes at the \"Sale of the Century\" which almost always included a new car. Originally, champions could buy prizes totaling no more than \u00a31,000 (\u00a32,500 in the late 1970s). From 1981 to 1983, any champion who won the game with \u00a3140 or more could choose to purchase one of the lesser four prizes or correctly answer a possible four of five questions, with no risk, to win a car.\n\nOn the 1989\u20131991 and 1997 versions, there were a series of six prizes (five in 1997) and as the contestant's score built up, it applied to the next highest prize, with a car again being the top prize, which was available for \u00a3585 (\u00a3500 in 1997). Like the Australian and American versions, they could buy the prize and leave or risk it and come back. However, unlike the Australian and American versions, there was no cash jackpot available or the chance to buy all the prizes on stage.\n\nOn all versions, losing contestants kept the money and prizes earned.\n\n==Other background information==\nThe series was one of the most consistently high-rating entertainment shows of the 1970s, gaining peak viewing figures of 20 million. This original version of the show was restricted in the prize amount through then national agreements, meaning that the featured cars had to be below set limits. The producers hence preferred to engage with foreign manufacturers to provide better value prize, often including top of the range [[Lada]]s.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, an all-out strike at the [[BBC]] meant that 21.2 million viewers watched the programme, the highest ever rating for a [[game show]] produced by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\nBy the time the original version ended, it had awarded 500 contestants over \u00a3500,000 in prizes.\n\nCelebrity special aired occasionally from 2 January 1981, with prizes won going to charities.\n\nThe show is often famed as having been the place that record producer [[Simon Cowell]] made his television debut. The video (of his appearance on the 1989 version) is available on [[YouTube]] and extracts of it were shown during the [[14th National Television Awards|National Television Awards]] in Cowell's VT before receiving the Special Recognition Award from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. Cowell appeared on 2 episodes (winning his first game) and won only \u00a320 worth of cooking utensils.\n\nThe show's theme tune, composed by Peter Fenn, was entitled \"Joyful Pete\", in tribute to the show's original producer, Peter Joy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-fenn-anglia-tv-s-musical-director-wrote-sale-of-the-century-quiz-theme-1-895267 |title=Peter Fenn: Anglia TV's musical director wrote Sale of the Century quiz theme |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref>\n\n==Transmissions==\n===ITV era===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
