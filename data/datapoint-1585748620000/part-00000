He has been active in the avant garde theatre in India in Marathi and Hindi theatre as an actor, director and producer since 1967. His contribution to the modern Indian theatre is often overshadowed by his popularity as a lead actor in Hindi films.\n\nAs a film actor, he was most prominent in the 1970s. His image as a \"boy next door\" contrasted with the larger-than-life heroes prevalent at that time in Indian cinema. He received one [[Filmfare award]] and six State awards as Best Actor. His performances in regional language films in Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Kannada fetched him critical acclaim as well. He decided not to act after 1986 in order to concentrate on filmmaking.\n\nAs a director, he is known for the sensitive portrayal of women, selection of classic stories from Indian literature, and perceptive handling of progressive issues. He has directed several television serials on the national network such as ''Kachchi Dhoop'', ''Mrignayani'', ''Naquab'', ''Paool Khuna'' and ''Krishna Kali''.\n\n===Theatre journey===\nPalekar began in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] experimental theatre with [[Satyadev Dubey]], and later started his own group, ''Aniket'', in 1972.\n\n===Movie career===\nPalekar made his debut in 1971 with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe]]'' directed by [[Satyadev Dubey]], which started the New Cinema Movement in Marathi.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amol Palekar's debut|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/did-you-know/Amol-Palekars-debut-/articleshow/13698397.cms|accessdate=27 June 2016|work=The Times of India|date=4 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220140351/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/did-you-know/Amol-Palekars-debut-/articleshow/13698397.cms|archive-date=20 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\nIn 1974 he was cast as an actor by [[Basu Chatterjee]] in ''[[Rajnigandha]]'', and in the surprise low-budget hit, ''[[Chhoti Si Baat]]''. This led to many other such roles in \"middle-class\" comedies, mostly alternative. These were mostly directed by Chatterjee or [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and included films such as ''[[Gol Maal]]'' and ''[[Naram Garam]]''. He won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for ''Gol Maal''.\n\nHe is noted for his image of the \"middle-class everyman\" who struggles to get a job (''[[Gol Maal]]''), his own flat (''[[Gharonda]]''), a girlfriend/wife (''[[Baaton Baaton Mein]]''), and appreciation from his boss.\n\nIn 1979, he was paired with a sixteen-year-old [[Sridevi]] in [[Solva Saawan]], which was her debut Hindi movie as a heroine. Amol played the role of an intellectually disabled man, a character played by [[Kamal Haasan]] in the original Tamil movie.\n\nIn 1982 he played the role of Ravi in the [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[Olangal]]''. He turned to directing with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Aakriet''. He showed his capabilities as a [[film director|director]] with movies such as [[Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen]] and [[Paheli]].

He has been active in the avant garde theatre in India in Marathi and Hindi theatre as an actor, director and producer since 1967. His contribution to the modern Indian theatre is often overshadowed by his popularity as a lead actor in Hindi films.\n\nAs a film actor, he was most prominent in the 1970s. His image as a \"boy next door\" contrasted with the larger-than-life heroes prevalent at that time in Indian cinema. He received one [[Filmfare award]] and six State awards as Best Actor. His performances in regional language films in Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Kannada fetched him critical acclaim as well. He decided not to act after 1986 in order to concentrate on filmmaking.\n\nAs a director, he is known for the sensitive portrayal of women, selection of classic stories from Indian literature, and perceptive handling of progressive issues. He has directed several television serials on the national network such as ''Kachchi Dhoop'', ''Mrignayani'', ''Naquab'', ''Paool Khuna'' and ''Krishna Kali''.\n\n===Theatre journey===\nPalekar began in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] experimental theatre with [[Satyadev Dubey]], and later started his own group, ''Aniket'', in 1972.\n\n===Movie career===\nPalekar made his debut in 1971 with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe]]'' directed by [[Satyadev Dubey]], which started the New Cinema Movement in Marathi.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amol Palekar's debut|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/did-you-know/Amol-Palekars-debut-/articleshow/13698397.cms|accessdate=27 June 2016|work=The Times of India|date=4 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220140351/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/did-you-know/Amol-Palekars-debut-/articleshow/13698397.cms|archive-date=20 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\nIn 1974 he was cast as an actor by [[Basu Chatterjee]] in ''[[Rajnigandha]]'', and in the surprise low-budget hit, ''[[Chhoti Si Baat]]''. This led to many other such roles in \"middle-class\" comedies, mostly alternative. These were mostly directed by Chatterjee or [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and included films such as ''[[Gol Maal]]'' and ''[[Naram Garam]]''. He won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for ''Gol Maal''.\n\nHe is noted for his image of the \"middle-class everyman\" who struggles to get a job (''[[Gol Maal]]''), his own flat (''[[Gharonda]]''), a girlfriend/wife (''[[Baaton Baaton Mein]]''), and appreciation from his boss.\n\nIn 1979, he was paired with a sixteen-year-old [[Sridevi]] in [[Solva Saawan]], which was her debut Hindi movie as a heroine. Amol played the role of an intellectually disabled man, a character played by [[Kamal Haasan]] in the original Tamil movie.\n\nIn 1982 he played the role of Ravi in the [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[Olangal]]''. He turned to directing with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Aakriet''. He showed his capabilities as a [[film director|director]] with movies such as [[Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen]] and [[Paheli]].
