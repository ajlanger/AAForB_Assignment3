The line occupied a point where the routes into Tunisia from the south converged, leading toward Mareth, with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east and a sand sea on the other.\n\nThe line ran north of Wadi Zigzaou for about {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-westwards from the [[Gulf of Gab\u00e8s]] to Cheguimi and the Djebel (mountain) Matmata on the Dahar plateau between the [[Grand Erg Oriental|Great Eastern Sand Sea]] and the [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]] hills. The [[Tebaga Gap]], between the Mareth line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.\n\nTunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was used by the Axis to defend against the British and Allied [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], which had conquered Libya early in 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===French strategy===\nIn 1930s the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria\u2013Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} (Air Force). By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} could spare only second-rate aircraft.

Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nThe geography of central Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat.

A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]].

The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. After the outbreak of the war a line of {{lang|fr|avant-postes}} advanced positions was built on the high ground of Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line saw no use from 1939\u20131940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks.

A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day. This success, combined with a fresh frontal assault, made the Mareth Line untenable but the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.

In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga\u2013Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|Giovani Fascisti}} on 22 March.<ref>[https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/division-giovani-fascisti-in-1943.html Giovani Fascisti division at Mareth]</ref> Earlier reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the Line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day. This success, combined with a fresh frontal assault, made the Mareth Line untenable but the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.
