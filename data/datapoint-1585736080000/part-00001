In the prosperous southern region of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], for example, the religious edicts of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] held sway among the [[Sabians]] and [[Himyarites]].  In other places such as the city of [[Makkah]] (Mecca) -- where the [[prophet of Islam]], [[Muhammad]], was born\u2014a tribal set of rights was in place.  This was also true amongst the [[Bedouin]] (desert dwellers), and this code varied from tribe to tribe.

But I think I\u2019ve found evidence in some of the early sources that seems to show that [[Muhammad]] made things better for women. It appears that in some parts of Arabia, notably in [[Mecca]], a [[matrilineal]] system was in the process of being replaced by a [[patrilineal]] one at the time of Muhammad. Growing prosperity caused by a shifting of [[trade route]]s was accompanied by a growth in [[individualism]]. Men were amassing considerable personal wealth and wanted to be sure that this would be inherited by their own actual sons, and not simply by an extended family of their sisters\u2019 sons. This led to a deterioration in the rights of women. At the time [[Islam]] began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons. Muhammad improved things quite a lot. By instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, he gave women certain basic safeguards. Set in such historical context the Prophet can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights. <sup><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2000_watt.htm|title=Interview with Prof William Montgomery Watt|website=www.alastairmcintosh.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref></sup></blockquote>\n\n===Early reforms===\n{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}\n\nDuring the [[early reforms under Islam]] in the 7th century, reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce and inheritance.<ref name=\"Espos\">Esposito (2005) p. 79</ref> Lindsay Jones says that women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.<ref>Jones, Lindsay. p.6224</ref> ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of [[female infanticide]] and recognizing women's full personhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510?_hi=2&_pos=2%5D|title=Women and Islam - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref> \"The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property.\"<ref name=\"Espos\"/><ref name=\"majid\">Khadduri (1978)</ref> Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a \"status\" but rather as a \"[[contract]]\", in which the woman's consent was imperative.<ref name=\"Espos\"/><ref name=\"majid\"/><ref name=\"OxfordDicT\">Esposito (2004), p. 339</ref> \"Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives.\"<ref name=\"Espos\"/> [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that \"compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.\"<ref name = \"Schimmel\">Schimmel (1992) p.65</ref> [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of [[women's rights]] and improved things considerably.

Firstly, the socio-economic environment discourages women from working despite encouraging them to get an education, especially in oil-rich Gulf nations. Oil and oil-related revenues perpetuate patriarchal family structures because the state itself is the \u201cpatriarch\u201d of its citizens, employing them and providing them with ready income. This means citizens don\u2019t have to look for ways to make money outside of state patronage, and may just reinforce already existing conservative gender roles where women stay at home. Oil and oil-related revenues also structure the economy away from female-intensive sectors. Secondly, patriarchal state institution systems often means weak, dependent private sectors that don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t afford to assume the cost of women\u2019s reproductive roles. This seriously hinders women's practical and logistical participation in the labor force. Thirdly, the inhospitable business environment in the private sector discourages women to work. No Arab country has a legal quota for the percentage of women it must include on corporate boards. Only Morocco and Djibouti have laws against gender discrimination in hiring and for equal remuneration for equal work. Algeria has also ruled in favor of equal pay for equal work.<ref name=\"blogs.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nWomen could contribute to the country's economy since women\u2019s employment can significantly improve household income\u2014by as much as 25 percent\u2014and lead many families out of poverty. It continues that increased household income will not only positively impact MENA economies on the micro-level, but it will bolster economies on the macro level as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MASRI |first1=FIRAS |title=Why the Arab World should employ more women |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/02/06/why-the-arab-world-should-employ-more-women/ |website=MARKAZ |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{see also|Women's education in Saudi Arabia|Madrasah#Female education|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab World}}The Muslim community is often criticized for not providing an equal opportunity for education for females.

But I think I\u2019ve found evidence in some of the early sources that seems to show that [[Muhammad]] made things better for women. It appears that in some parts of Arabia, notably in [[Mecca]], a [[matrilineal]] system was in the process of being replaced by a [[patrilineal]] one at the time of Muhammad. Growing prosperity caused by a shifting of [[trade route]]s was accompanied by a growth in [[individualism]]. Men were amassing considerable personal wealth and wanted to be sure that this would be inherited by their own actual sons, and not simply by an extended family of their sisters\u2019 sons. This led to a deterioration in the rights of women. At the time [[Islam]] began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons. Muhammad improved things quite a lot. By instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, he gave women certain basic safeguards.

Firstly, the socio-economic environment discourages women from working despite encouraging them to get an education, especially in oil-rich Gulf nations. Oil and oil-related revenues perpetuate patriarchal family structures because the state itself is the \u201cpatriarch\u201d of its citizens, employing them and providing them with ready income. This means citizens don\u2019t have to look for ways to make money outside of state patronage, and may just reinforce already existing conservative gender roles where women stay at home. Oil and oil-related revenues also structure the economy away from female-intensive sectors. Secondly, patriarchal state institution systems often means weak, dependent private sectors that don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t afford to assume the cost of women\u2019s reproductive roles. This seriously hinders women's practical and logistical participation in the labor force. Thirdly, the inhospitable business environment in the private sector discourages women to work. No Arab country has a legal quota for the percentage of women it must include on corporate boards. Only Morocco and Djibouti have laws against gender discrimination in hiring and for equal remuneration for equal work. Algeria has also ruled in favor of equal pay for equal work.<ref name=\"blogs.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nWomen could contribute to the country's economy since women\u2019s employment can significantly improve household income\u2014by as much as 25 percent\u2014and lead many families out of poverty. It continues that increased household income will not only positively impact MENA economies on the micro-level, but it will bolster economies on the macro level as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MASRI |first1=FIRAS |title=Why the Arab World should employ more women |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/02/06/why-the-arab-world-should-employ-more-women/ |website=MARKAZ |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{see also|Women's education in Saudi Arabia|Madrasah#Female education|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab World}}The Muslim community is often criticized for not providing an equal opportunity for education for females.
