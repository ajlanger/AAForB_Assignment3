The company designs, develops, manufactures and maintains aircraft, aero-engines, aerospace components and aerostructures.\n\nEstablished in 1884 as ''Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A.'', it shares its ancestry with motor vehicle manufacturer [[Piaggio]] and is one of the world's oldest aircraft manufacturers, having produced its first aircraft during 1915. The company's facilities were rebuilt following the [[World War II|Second World War]] and several original designs, including the [[Piaggio P.136|P.136]] [[seaplane]], the [[Piaggio P.149|P.149]] trainer aircraft, and the [[Piaggio P.166|P.166]] utility transport, were released during the first two decades of the [[postwar]] era. During the 1960s, Piaggio began manufacturing [[jet engine]]s as well. During 1966, the business was separated into the aviation-focused ''Piaggio Aero'' and the [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]] manufacturer [[Vespa]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, Piaggio developed a new generation [[business aircraft]], the [[Piaggio P.180 Avanti|P.180 Avanti]]. During the late 1990s, Piaggio underwent drastic changes following its [[bankruptcy]]. The company was negatively impacted by the [[Great Recession]] and the downturn in the [[business aircraft]] market. During late 2018, the company entered into [[receivership]] after having declared itself [[insolvent]]. The firm owns a subsidiary in the [[United States]], ''Piaggio America'', located at [[West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Piaggo Focke-Wulf 149.jpg|thumb|A [[Piaggio P.149]]]]\n[[File:Piaggio P166 Albatross ZU-NJZ (Ex SAAF 898) (2) (6925889329).jpg|thumb|A [[Piaggio P.166]] in flight]]\n\nThe Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A. company was founded in [[Genoa]], Italy, in 1884.<ref name = \"corp history\">{{cite web |url = http://www.piaggioaerospace.it/en/corporate |title = Corporate: History |publisher = Piaggio Aerospace |accessdate = 27 March 2020}}</ref> Originally, the company was involved in the outfitting of [[ocean liner]]s and the manufacturing of [[rolling stock]] for the developing Italian railway infrastructure around the turn of the century.

Penga and Gabrielli worked together to create numerous technical solutions to aviation problems; to support their aerodynamic research, in 1928, Piaggio completed an innovative [[wind tunnel]].<ref name = \"corp history\"/> The firm eventually helped to bring forth the design and construction of the world's first [[helicopter]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring 1938, Senator Rinaldo Piaggio died at 71 years old, thus ending the Rinaldo Piaggio era. That same year, the firm finished construction of the new [[Piaggio P.108]] heavy bomber, its first four-engined aircraft.<ref name = \"corp history\"/> During the battles and widespread devastation of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Piaggio's facilities were reduced to ruins. Rinaldo's sons Enrico, inventor of the [[Vespa]] motor scooter, and Armando, played key roles in the [[postwar]] rebuilding process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1948, Piaggio launched the [[Piaggio P.136]], a twin-engine seaplane that was operated by the [[Italian Air Force]] and various other operators, often in liaison/sea transport capacity. The company also benefited from an increased demand for basic aircraft training; during 1953, the [[German Air Force]] ordered 265 [[Piaggio P.149]] trainers. By 1957, Piaggio had also developed the [[Piaggio P.166]], a twin-engine light transport aircraft, which was marketed and produced for military customers and civilian personnel worldwide.<ref name = \"corp history\"/>\n\nIn 1960, Piaggio secured a [[licensed production|production license]] for the [[Rolls Royce Viper]] [[turbojet]] engine; shortly thereafter, the firm began manufacturing jet engines.

From the financial gains that it had garnered from these industries, Rinaldo Piaggio was able to construct a large factory based in [[Final Marina]] during 1906.{{CN|date=March 2020}} In 1915, during the opening years of the [[World War I|First World War]], the company produced its first Piaggio-branded aircraft.<ref name = \"corp history\"/>\n\nThe 1920s was a particularly turbulent and influential period in the company's history; Piaggio Aero brought on two new [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]s, Giovanni Pegna and [[Giuseppe Gabrielli]], who both played a major role in developing Piaggio's aeronautical sector. Penga and Gabrielli worked together to create numerous technical solutions to aviation problems; to support their aerodynamic research, in 1928, Piaggio completed an innovative [[wind tunnel]].<ref name = \"corp history\"/> The firm eventually helped to bring forth the design and construction of the world's first [[helicopter]].{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring 1938, Senator Rinaldo Piaggio died at 71 years old, thus ending the Rinaldo Piaggio era. That same year, the firm finished construction of the new [[Piaggio P.108]] heavy bomber, its first four-engined aircraft.<ref name = \"corp history\"/> During the battles and widespread devastation of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Piaggio's facilities were reduced to ruins. Rinaldo's sons Enrico, inventor of the [[Vespa]] motor scooter, and Armando, played key roles in the [[postwar]] rebuilding process.{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1948, Piaggio launched the [[Piaggio P.136]], a twin-engine seaplane that was operated by the [[Italian Air Force]] and various other operators, often in liaison/sea transport capacity. The company also benefited from an increased demand for basic aircraft training; during 1953, the [[German Air Force]] ordered 265 [[Piaggio P.149]] trainers. By 1957, Piaggio had also developed the [[Piaggio P.166]], a twin-engine light transport aircraft, which was marketed and produced for military customers and civilian personnel worldwide.<ref name = \"corp history\"/>\n\nIn 1960, Piaggio secured a [[licensed production|production license]] for the [[Rolls Royce Viper]] [[turbojet]] engine; shortly thereafter, the firm began manufacturing jet engines. Four years later, it built its first [[jet propulsion|jet-powered]] aircraft, the [[Piaggio PD.808]] [[business aircraft]].<ref name = \"corp history\"/> The 1960s was a decade of considerable expansion for Piaggio, moving beyond its core business focus. During 1966, the company formally separated into two separate entities, one being the aviation-focused Piaggio Aero and the other becoming Vespa, a specialist company in the production of [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooters]].{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Piaggio aero logo.gif|thumb|Old Piaggio Aero logo]]\n[[File:2010-04-11 14 28 33 Switzerland Kloten Kaserne (cropped).jpg|thumb|Planform view of the [[Piaggio P.180 Avanti]], highlighting its unusual design]]\nDuring the 1980s, Piaggio developed a new generation [[business aircraft]], the [[Piaggio P.180 Avanti|P.180 Avanti]]; its unconventional appearence was reportedly designed to appeal to [[Fortune 500]] clients.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Weiner |first1=Eric |title=Innovative Plane Making Its Debut |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/business/innovative-plane-making-its-debut.html |accessdate=22 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 June 1989 |quote=Like the Starship, the Piaggio Avanti features a canard and rear-mounted engines.
