With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". Later in the programme's run the Daleks acquired [[time travel in fiction|time travel technology]] and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across the whole of history.\n\nThe Daleks are the show's most popular and famous villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.<ref name=Evolution/>\n\nThe Daleks returned in the 2008 season's two-part finale, \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\"/\"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in \"The Vault\", a section of the Dalek flagship, the ''Crucible''. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a \"reality bomb\" for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of [[Donna Noble]], a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.<ref name=Stolen>{{cite episode | title = [[The Stolen Earth]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 28 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=Journey>{{cite episode | title = [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 5 July 2008}}</ref> The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode \"[[Victory of the Daleks]]\", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the \"Progenitor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |publisher=BBC |title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator |last=McKinstry |first=Peter |access-date=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224205734/http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532//doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA.

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as ''\"Ka Faraq Gatri\"'' (\"Bringer of Darkness\" or \"Destroyer of Worlds\"), and \"The Oncoming Storm\".<ref name=Parting/><ref name=\"Journey\"/> Both the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) and [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear.

However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels.

The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called \"Dr. Who\" who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called \"the TARDIS\".<ref>Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129</ref>\n\nFour books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s.

The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the

With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\".

The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.<ref name=\"Monsters-82\"/>\n\nIn addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director or dialogue. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: \"You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

Season 5, episode 3.</ref>\n\nBecause the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective [[Archenemy|arch-enemy]] and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as ''\"Ka Faraq Gatri\"'' (\"Bringer of Darkness\" or \"Destroyer of Worlds\"), and \"The Oncoming Storm\".<ref name=Parting/><ref name=\"Journey\"/> Both the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) and [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as \"pest control\", \"one Doctor\" visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil).<ref name=\"Doomsday\"/> To his indignant surprise, in \"Asylum of the Daleks\", the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) learns that the Daleks have designated him as \"The Predator\".\n\nAs the Doctor escapes the Asylum (with companions Amy and Rory), a Dalek-converted-human (Oswin Oswald) prisoner provides critical assistance, which culminates in completely deleting the Doctor from the Dalek hive-consciousness (the PathWeb), thus wiping the slate entirely blank. However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels. The first panel contains the title \"The Daleks\" in jagged white letters.

The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called \"Dr. Who\" who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called \"the TARDIS\".<ref>Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129</ref>\n\nFour books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s.

The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies
