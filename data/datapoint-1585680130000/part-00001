The FMLA is administered by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]].\n\nThe FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness. The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees, including elected officials and highly compensated employees, are excluded from the law or face certain limitations. In order to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work for an employer with at least fifty employees. Several states have passed laws providing additional family and medical leave protections for workers.\n\n==Background==\n\nPrior to the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], a family medical leave act had been vetoed twice by President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilentz|first1=Sean|title=The Age of Reagan|date=2008|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-074480-9|pp=[https://archive.org/details/ageofreaganhisto00wile/page/327 327\u2013328]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofreaganhisto00wile/page/327}}</ref> After [[Bill Clinton]] won the 1992 election, a law protecting family medical leave became one of his major first-term domestic priorities. Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a necessary federal regulation that would support the working class who desired to raise a family and/or required time off for illness related situations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=46777|title=William J.

Employees must have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year (around 25 hours a week). However, employees \"at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50.\"<ref>29 USC \u00a72611(2)</ref> A worksite includes a public agency, including schools and state, local, and federal employers. The 50 employee threshold does not apply to public agency employees and local educational agencies. There are special hours rules for certain airline employees.<ref>{{cite news|title=Family and Medical Leave Act Airline Flight Crew Technical Amendments|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/airline.htm#.UMkHuIPAdBM}}</ref>\n\nEmployees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is \"foreseeable\",<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(e)</ref> and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged \"so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer\" according to medical advice.<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(e)(2)</ref>\n\nAlong with the 30 day notice, there are also other requirements to be made when seeking the FMLA rights. If an employee wants to leave the first time using ones FMLA rights, the person must first claim the Family and Medical Leave Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/family-and-medical-leave/|title=Family and Medical Leave for Federal Employees|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> In the case that an employee were to leave again under the FMLA act, the same process must proceed.<ref name=\"FS28\">{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet #28: The Family and Medical Leave Act |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf |website=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=21 August 2019 |date=2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of employees, there is a [[certification]] as well. The absence of an employee due to the conditions he or she may have may require a certification as proof of the verification of absence.<ref name=\"FS28\" /> In order to certify the leave of an employee, the employer may ask for other requirements. An example of these requirements are requiring multiple medical opinions. All of these prerequisites are at the employer's [[expense]]. There are also certain rules that may apply to those who work at local education [[Institution|agencies]].<ref name=\"FS28\" />\n\n===Rights during leave===\nEmployees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health.<ref>29 USC \u00a72512(a)(2) and on adoption, see ''[[Kelley v Crosfield Catalysts]]'' 135 F2d 1202 (7th Circuit 1998) The same rules for federal employees were codified in 5 USC \u00a7\u00a76381\u20136387.</ref> In full, the purposes for leave are:\n* to care for a new child, whether for the birth, the adoption, or placement of a child in foster care;\n* to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) (Note: Son/daughter has been clarified by the Department of Labor to mean a child under the age of 18 or a child over the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, which excludes, among other conditions, pregnancy and post-partum recovery from childbirth);<ref>{{cite news|title=DoL Opinion|url=http://www.dol.gov/WHD/opinion/fmla/prior2002/FMLA-51.htm}}</ref>\n* to recover from a worker's own serious illness;\n* to care for an injured service member in the family; or\n* to address qualifying exigencies arising out of a family member's deployment.\n* twenty-six workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the servicemember's spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act \u2013 Wage and Hour Division (WHD) \u2013 U.S. Department of Labor |publisher=Dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n\nChild care leave should be taken in one lump, unless an employer agrees otherwise.<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(a)(2)</ref> If a father and mother have the same employer, they must share their leave, in effect halving each person's rights, if the employer so chooses.<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(f) \u201cthe aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both may be entitled may be limited to 12 workweeks\u201d</ref>\n\nEmployers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave.<ref>29 USC \u00a72614(c).

Also, a military caregiver provision was added that would allow a caregiver to take up to 26 weeks of leave in order to actively care for a military member who requires medical attention for acute or ongoing conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/MilitaryFLProvisions.htm|title=Military Family Leave Provisions of the FMLA - Wage and Hour Division (WHD) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>\n\n===Substitute leave===\nUnder \u00a72612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for \"accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave\" in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc]]'' held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law.<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2002/557.html 535 US 81] (2002)</ref>\n\n===Right to return to job===\nAfter unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to their job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal \"is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.\"<ref>29 USC \u00a72614(b). Under 29 USC \u00a72612(b)(2) employers may transfer employees to another position with similar pay and benefits if health absences could be intermittent.

An employee is entitled to reinstatement of all benefits to which the employee was entitled before going on leave.\n* protection of the employee to not have their rights under the Act interfered with or denied by an employer.\n* protection of the employee from retaliation by an employer for exercising rights under the Act.\n* intermittent FMLA leave for their own serious health condition, or the serious health condition of a family member.

This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsidize parents' costs.<ref>e.g. D Paquette, 'The enormous ambition of Hillary Clinton's child-care plan' (May 12, 2016) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/ The Washington Post]</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nCritics of the act have suggested that by mandating various forms of leave that are used more often by female than male employees, the Act, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, makes women more expensive to employ than men. They argue that employers will engage in subtle discrimination against women in the hiring process, discrimination which is much less obvious to detect than [[pregnancy discrimination]] against the already hired. Throughout history, gender discrimination towards women was common; certain laws were placed that would restrict a woman's option in choosing a working position, as well as, how many hours she could work<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Deborah J.|year=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender-Neutral Versus Gender-Equal|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=jgspl|journal=Gender, Social Policy & the Law|volume=16|pages=4|via=Digital Commons}}</ref> ei. Employers  Supporters counter that the act, in contrast to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, is aimed at both women and men, and is part of an overall strategy to encourage both men and women to take family-related leave.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla|title=FMLA (Family & Medical Leave)|date=2015-12-09|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref> However, this is based on the assumption that men will take advantage of the opportunity of unpaid leave at comparable rates to women. According to Grossman, there is no basis for this assumption upon the inception of the legislation and no evidence has been found today to support this assumption. Therefore, the employer incentive to prefer male employees is preserved despite the equal opportunity for both sexes to take leave.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Joanna|date=20 April 2004|title=Job Security Without Equality: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|journal=Journal of Law and Policy|volume=15|issue=17|pages=17\u201363 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol15/iss1/3}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the FMLA is much less comprehensive than Western European leave policies. Namely, the United States is the only industrialized country without paid leave for parents. The following table illustrates the lack of provisions offered in the United States as compared to that of other industrialized countries. For instance, all Western European nations have maternity paid leave and over half have paternity and sick child care paid leave, while the United States has no paid leave.<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Pyle |first1=Jean L. |last2=Pelletier |first2=Marianne S. |title=Family and medical leave act: unresolved issues |journal=New Solutions |date=1 March 2003 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=353\u201384 |doi=10.2190/7K3G-MW4M-6J7X-U4EV |pmid=17208739}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Maternity\n!Paternity\n!Sick Child (over 3 years)\n!Sick Spouse/Parent\n!Own Illness\n|-\n|United States\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|-\n|Austria\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Belgium\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Denmark\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Finland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|France\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Germany\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Greece\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Ireland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Italy\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Luxembourg\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Portugal\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Spain\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Sweden\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>{{aye}} = available, {{nay}} = not available, {{steady}}  = not applicable<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\" />\n\nAdditionally, workplace fairness has been questioned under the Act. For instance, any woman-specific benefits provided by the legislation were considered special treatment and thus unacceptable, and ignoring the idea that women may have a greater share of burden of caregiving in reality. In retort, supporters may argue that creating such legislation that recognizes the female's greater role in child care,  stereotype would be reinforced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|last2=Deborah|date=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender Neutral versus Gender Equal|journal=Journal of Gender Social Policy and the Law|volume=16|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the implementation of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits.

The FMLA is administered by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]].\n\nThe FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness. The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees, including elected officials and highly compensated employees, are excluded from the law or face certain limitations. In order to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work for an employer with at least fifty employees. Several states have passed laws providing additional family and medical leave protections for workers.\n\n==Background==\n\nPrior to the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], a family medical leave act had been vetoed twice by President [[George H. W.

Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a necessary federal regulation that would support the working class who desired to raise a family and/or required time off for illness related situations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=46777|title=William J.

In June 2007, the Department of Labor estimated that of 141.7 million workers in the United States, 94.4 million worked at FMLA-covered worksites, and 76.1 million were eligible for FMLA leave. Only eight to 17.1 percent of covered, eligible workers (or between 6.1 million and 13.0 million workers) took FMLA leave in 2005.<ref>\"Family and Medical Leave Act Regulations: A Report on the Department of Labor\u2019s Request for Information.\" 28 June 2007.

Chatterji and Markowitz <ref>Chatterji, P. and Markowitz, S. 2005. \"Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Mental Health.\" ''Southern Economic Journal''. 72(1):16\u201341.</ref> also found an association between longer lengths of maternity leave and lesser incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] among mothers.\n\nDespite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free [[child care]] or [[day care]]. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsidize parents' costs.<ref>e.g. D Paquette, 'The enormous ambition of Hillary Clinton's child-care plan' (May 12, 2016) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/ The Washington Post]</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nCritics of the act have suggested that by mandating various forms of leave that are used more often by female than male employees, the Act, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, makes women more expensive to employ than men. They argue that employers will engage in subtle discrimination against women in the hiring process, discrimination which is much less obvious to detect than [[pregnancy discrimination]] against the already hired. Throughout history, gender discrimination towards women was common; certain laws were placed that would restrict a woman's option in choosing a working position, as well as, how many hours she could work<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Deborah J.|year=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender-Neutral Versus Gender-Equal|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=jgspl|journal=Gender, Social Policy & the Law|volume=16|pages=4|via=Digital Commons}}</ref> ei. Employers  Supporters counter that the act, in contrast to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, is aimed at both women and men, and is part of an overall strategy to encourage both men and women to take family-related leave.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla|title=FMLA (Family & Medical Leave)|date=2015-12-09|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref> However, this is based on the assumption that men will take advantage of the opportunity of unpaid leave at comparable rates to women. According to Grossman, there is no basis for this assumption upon the inception of the legislation and no evidence has been found today to support this assumption. Therefore, the employer incentive to prefer male employees is preserved despite the equal opportunity for both sexes to take leave.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Joanna|date=20 April 2004|title=Job Security Without Equality: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|journal=Journal of Law and Policy|volume=15|issue=17|pages=17\u201363 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol15/iss1/3}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the FMLA is much less comprehensive than Western European leave policies. Namely, the United States is the only industrialized country without paid leave for parents. The following table illustrates the lack of provisions offered in the United States as compared to that of other industrialized countries. For instance, all Western European nations have maternity paid leave and over half have paternity and sick child care paid leave, while the United States has no paid leave.<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Pyle |first1=Jean L. |last2=Pelletier |first2=Marianne S. |title=Family and medical leave act: unresolved issues |journal=New Solutions |date=1 March 2003 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=353\u201384 |doi=10.2190/7K3G-MW4M-6J7X-U4EV |pmid=17208739}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Maternity\n!Paternity\n!Sick Child (over 3 years)\n!Sick Spouse/Parent\n!Own Illness\n|-\n|United States\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|-\n|Austria\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Belgium\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Denmark\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Finland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|France\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Germany\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Greece\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Ireland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Italy\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Luxembourg\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Portugal\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Spain\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Sweden\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>{{aye}} = available, {{nay}} = not available, {{steady}}  = not applicable<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\" />\n\nAdditionally, workplace fairness has been questioned under the Act. For instance, any woman-specific benefits provided by the legislation were considered special treatment and thus unacceptable, and ignoring the idea that women may have a greater share of burden of caregiving in reality. In retort, supporters may argue that creating such legislation that recognizes the female's greater role in child care,  stereotype would be reinforced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|last2=Deborah|date=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender Neutral versus Gender Equal|journal=Journal of Gender Social Policy and the Law|volume=16|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the implementation of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits.
