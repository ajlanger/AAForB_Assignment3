The first road bridge to Atlantic City opened in 1905, using Albany Avenue on what is now [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|US 40]]/[[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|322]]. In 1916, the causeway that is now [[New Jersey Route 152]] opened between Somers Point and Longport. In 1919, the White Horse Pike ([[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|US 30]]) was completed from Atlantic City to Camden, and repaved through the county in 1925. Also in 1922, the Harding Highway (US 40) opened from [[Pennsville Township, New Jersey|Pennsville Township]] to Atlantic City, named after then-President [[Warren G. Harding]].<ref name=\"lemon\"/> In 1928, the [[Beesley's Point Bridge]] opened, replacing the ferry between Somers Point and Cape May County.<ref name=\"bee\"/> The [[Black Horse Pike]] ([[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|US 322]]) opened in 1935, connecting Atlantic City to Camden.
