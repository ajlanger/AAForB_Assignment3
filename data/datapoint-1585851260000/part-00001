{"title_page": "List of English-language book publishing companies", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of English-language [[Publishing|book publisher]]s'''. It includes imprints of larger publishing groups, which may have resulted from business mergers. Included are academic publishers, technical manual publishers, publishers for the traditional book trade (both for adults and children), religious publishers, and small press publishers, among other types. The list includes defunct publishers.
