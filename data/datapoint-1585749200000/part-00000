''[[Time magazine]]'' named it \"Movie of the Year\". The film's studio [[RKO]] tried an experimental reissue of ''King Kong'' in the Midwest United States in 1952. In an unprecedented move they committed most of ''King Kong's'' promotional budget to television spots. The re-release was an enormous success, with the film attracting triple the usual business in its markets. This showed that television was a powerful tool for promotion. ''King Kong'' generated more box office receipts than the original 1933 release had.<ref name=Erb/> Theatre owners named it Picture of the Year.<ref name=Morton/> It was at this time that King Kong acquired its reputation as a popular culture phenomenon. The two most significant spinoffs of King Kong in this period were ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949) and ''Godzilla'' (1954). Godzilla was inspired by King Kong's popularity in Japan. Godzilla revived and reconfigured parts of the King Kong story more powerfully than any other spinoff has.<ref name=Erb/> RKO theatrically re-released ''King Kong'' for the last time in 1956.\n\n''King Kong'' was sold to television after the conclusion of the 1956 release. One channel in New York showed the film seventeen times in a single week, with each showing topping the ratings. From then on, the film was a television mainstay that captured many new fans.<ref name=Morton/>\n\nThere is a reference to the real-world revival and massive success of ''King Kong'' in the 1950s in the 1959 movie ''[[A Summer Place (film)|A Summer Place]]''. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents that they are going to a classic movie showing of ''King Kong'', when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls ''King Kong'' \"one of those wonderful old horror numbers.\" Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not be able to answer his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, \"It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end. That's the part everybody remembers.\".<ref name=Erb/> In 1974's ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' [[Alonzo Hawk]] has been having nightmares about [[Herbie]]. During his [[dream sequence|nightmare sequence]] there is a ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like [[airplane|plane]]s flying around him and squirting [[oil]] until he falls off the [[Empire State Building]]. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape. This ape had a liking to Lois Lane, and in one story climbed up the [[Daily Planet]] building.\n\nKing Kong reached the height of its public visibility in the twentieth century in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of a nostalgic trend to 1930s Hollywood. ''King Kong'' was becoming a cult film with nostalgia value. During this period the character and story of King Kong was most frequently used as a parody in popular culture. The frequency of its use as a parody at this time shows how significant it had become in popular culture.<ref name=Erb/> In the 1968 film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the characters look in a room where a monster ape smashes through a window to get at a screaming woman on a bed. \"Do you think we're interrupting something?\" [[George Harrison|George]] nonchalantly comments of it, to which [[John Lennon|John]] replies, \"I think so.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s RKO began to license a series of King Kong-related products in response to a heavy demand from the public. These products included comic books, games, models, and posters. In 1969 most of the censored shots were found. In 1971 a version of ''King Kong'' with these long-missing portions returned to their proper places was released to [[art house]]s.\n\nReferences to King Kong in popular culture have been widespread since the 1960s. The references have different tones, with some being parodies while others are parodies or oppositional critiques. Some of these references are fleeting (for example, [[Frank Zappa]] named one of his more complex compositions with the Mothers of Invention after Kong), but nevertheless are evidence of King Kong's importance in popular culture. King Kong has been cited in films such as ''[[Morgan!]]'' (1966), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' (1987).<ref name=Erb/> In ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the song \"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\" pays homage to King Kong with the lyric: \"Then something went wrong for [[Fay Wray]] and King Kong ... they got caught in a celluloid jam.\" At the end of the film, Rocky carries Dr. Frankenfurter on the RKO logo, replicating what King Kong carrying Fay Wray in the climax of King Kong.\n\nIn 1965 ''[[Monocle (satirical magazine)|Monocle]]'', a [[political satire]] magazine, cohosted a publisher's party at the Empire State Building with [[Bantam Books]], who were reissuing [[Delos W. Lovelace]]'s novelization of ''King Kong''. A panel of ''Monocle'' satirists was due to give an ironic commentary on ''King Kong'', followed by a screening of the film. One of the titles on the satirists\u2019 program was \"King Kong to Viet Cong: Thirty Years of Gorilla Warfare\". [[Andy Warhol]], who was not on the guest list, used the occasion to generate publicity and create a performance by complaining to the press that ''King Kong'' should be screened with his own film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964). Warhol was permitted to show three minutes of ''Empire'' after ''King Kong''. ''Empire'' was then criticized in the press for being too dull and being upstaged by ''King Kong''.<ref name = Erb/>\n\nBy the 1970s the character of King Kong was constantly referenced in cartoons and jokes. In a 1972 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoon, a man at a cocktail party atop the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] comments that he is impressed that it was \"finished so quickly and without incident,\" while King Kong climbs up the building below him. It was at this time that the film began to be studied by academics and film theoreticians, who found hidden subtexts and symbolic meanings in the film. However, [[Merian C. Cooper]] maintained that the film was nothing more than a simple adventure story.<ref name=Morton/>\n\n[[Thomas Pynchon]], in his post-modern 1973 novel, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', treats the King Kong/[[Ann Darrow]] relationship as an obvious metaphor for Americans' historical racist paranoia of black men dating white women.  He quotes the fictional film reviewer, Mitchel Prettyplace, from his \"definitive 18-volume study of King Kong\", which includes \"even interviews with King Kong Kultists, who to be eligible for the group must have seen the movie at least 100 times and be prepared to pass an 8-hour entrance exam.\"\n\nKing Kong influenced the 1974 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story \"[[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]]\", where the [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]] and his friends in [[UNIT (Doctor Who)|UNIT]] must stop Experimental Prototype Robot K-1 aiding the evil Scientific Reform Society in conquering the world. In homage to King Kong, K-1 falls for the Doctor's friend [[Sarah Jane Smith]], and views her as the one human being it is willing to spare from destruction. When the Doctor is forced to destroy K-1 with a metal-eating virus, Sarah is visibly saddened.\n\nAfter the highly promoted but vastly inferior 1976 remake of ''King Kong'', [[Elliot Stein]] wrote a nostalgic fan homage essay to ''King Kong'' called \"My Life with Kong\" in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Stein was one of the most famous of the \"Kongophiles\" along with [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] and [[Jean Boullet]]. In the essay Stein talks about the contexts in which he has seen ''King Kong'' during his life, including in the 1930s in New York picture palaces like [[Radio City Music Hall]], and the [[RKO Roxy]] and in Paris with Jean Boullet in the 1950s. There was an [[art deco]] retrospective of ''King Kong'' at the Radio City Music Hall in the 1974 and a ''King Kong'' homage was staged for the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in the 1970s.<ref name=Erb/> King Kong was also mentioned by name by [[Kermit the Frog]] in lyrics from the song \"I Hope that Something Better Comes Along\" from ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'': ''\"She made a monkey out of old King Kong/I hope that something better comes along.\"''\n\nAdditionally, King Kong is one of the epithets [[Redd Foxx]]'s character, Fred G. Sanford, from ''[[Sanford and Son (TV series)|Sanford and Son]]'' used referring to his sister-in-law Esther.\n\nThe corpse of King Kong, said to be a leftover prop, appears in the 1978 film ''[[Bye Bye Monkey]]'', where a small [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] is found inside of it.\n\n==1980s to the present ==\n''King Kong'' was the first film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' was actually the first\u2014although it featured a rampaging ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' rather than a non-science-based monster\u2014but was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film that has been made since 1933. These include ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).<ref name=Jones/> The dinosaur scenes from ''King Kong'' are referenced or mimicked in the three ''Jurassic Park'' films, especially the second film, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'') is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called ''The Venture'', which is the name of the ship in ''King Kong''). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in ''King Kong'', [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character asks, \"What have they got in there, King Kong?\" In the third film in this series, a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' vs. ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' fight is similar to the Kong\u2013rex battle in the original and the second remake.<ref name=Hirschman>Hirschman, Elizabeth C., 2000, ''Heroes, Monster & Messiahs'', Andrews McMeel Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7407-0485-0}}.</ref>\n[[File:kinghomer.jpg|thumb|[[Homer Simpson]] as [[King Kong]].

Courtesy of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.]]\n\nOne of the most frequently used images of King Kong in popular culture is the scene where King Kong and Ann Darrow are on top of the Empire State Building. This image has been copied or parodied in cartoons, comic books, horror films, and television commercials.<ref name=Jones/> A popular television spoof was the segment 'King Homer' from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\", in which the King Kong story was retold featuring ''Simpsons'' characters, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] as Kong, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] as Ann Darrow and [[Mr. Burns]] as [[Carl Denham]]. The spoof follows the plot of the 1933 film closely; however, it ends with Marge marrying King Homer after he collapses in exhaustion, failing to climb beyond the second story of the Springfield State Building. King Kong's family, consisting of smaller apes, appear at the wedding, and Homer has a habit of eating people; at the end he eats Marge's father. King Homer also has a cameo in the music video for \"[[Deep, Deep Trouble]]\" from ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]'' CD, and years later, makes another appearance in the opening [[couch gag]] of \"[[Jazzy and the Pussycats]].\" Homer grabs Marge from the couch and scales the Empire State Building, all while fending off 1930s-style airplanes.<ref name=Erb/> King Homer (or Homer Kong) would reappear battling Bridezilla (a Godzilla version of [[Marge Simpson]]) in the episode \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\". The character also appeared in video games such as ''[[Bart's Nightmare]]'' and ''[[Treehouse of Horror (video game)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' as well as various merchandise such as toys and T-shirts. The original film was referenced again on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode \"[[Monty Can't Buy Me Love]]\", where Mr. Burns captures the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and brings him back to America to entertain an audience; however, instead of the Monster going berserk during its debut, Burns himself is startled by the flash photography and causes the carnage.<ref name=Snpp>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911091156/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 |date=2007-09-11 }} episode capsule at [[The Simpsons Archive]].</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]'' episode \"Hostile Makeover\", Jenny is turned into a Neanderthal and gorilla-like monster; when the cameras flashed their lights to take pictures of her, she roared.\n\nIn the second ''[[Futurama]]'' film, ''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]'' Richard Nixon's head remarks about an alien invasion that King Kong is \"too old to save us this time\", and the camera pans to an elderly King Kong holding Ann Darrow's skeleton.\n\nKing Kong is often used in commercial culture, for example in advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Energizer Batteries]].<ref name=Erb/><ref name=Morton/> A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life.<ref name=Morton/> A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) to get rid of the [[Energizer Bunny]] for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with [[biplanes]] flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling.<ref name=Sweet>Sweet, Leonard, 2001, ''Soultsunami: Sink Or Swim in New Millennium Culture'', Zondervan, {{ISBN|0-310-24312-2}}.</ref> In 1990 [[Kongfrontation]] became one of the original rides at [[Universal Studios Florida]].\n\nThe film character was the inspiration for the 1981 [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and subsequent spin-offs. In the game, the hero must rescue his girlfriend from the [[Donkey Kong (character)|eponymous ape]]. The marauding ape climbs a huge structure after kidnapping the woman, as in the film. The game's creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], intended the name \"Donkey Kong\" to mean \"stubborn gorilla\". [[MCA/Universal]] attempted to sue Nintendo for [[copyright infringement]] in ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'', claiming that the game infringed its copyright for the film. However, they lost and had to pay Nintendo $1.8 million in damages when it was discovered that King Kong was in fact in the [[public domain]] at that time and that MCA/Universal knew this when they filed the lawsuit.

''[[Time magazine]]'' named it \"Movie of the Year\". The film's studio [[RKO]] tried an experimental reissue of ''King Kong'' in the Midwest United States in 1952. In an unprecedented move they committed most of ''King Kong's'' promotional budget to television spots. The re-release was an enormous success, with the film attracting triple the usual business in its markets. This showed that television was a powerful tool for promotion. ''King Kong'' generated more box office receipts than the original 1933 release had.<ref name=Erb/> Theatre owners named it Picture of the Year.<ref name=Morton/> It was at this time that King Kong acquired its reputation as a popular culture phenomenon. The two most significant spinoffs of King Kong in this period were ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949) and ''Godzilla'' (1954). Godzilla was inspired by King Kong's popularity in Japan. Godzilla revived and reconfigured parts of the King Kong story more powerfully than any other spinoff has.<ref name=Erb/> RKO theatrically re-released ''King Kong'' for the last time in 1956.\n\n''King Kong'' was sold to television after the conclusion of the 1956 release. One channel in New York showed the film seventeen times in a single week, with each showing topping the ratings. From then on, the film was a television mainstay that captured many new fans.<ref name=Morton/>\n\nThere is a reference to the real-world revival and massive success of ''King Kong'' in the 1950s in the 1959 movie ''[[A Summer Place (film)|A Summer Place]]''. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents that they are going to a classic movie showing of ''King Kong'', when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls ''King Kong'' \"one of those wonderful old horror numbers.\" Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not be able to answer his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, \"It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end. That's the part everybody remembers.\".<ref name=Erb/> In 1974's ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' [[Alonzo Hawk]] has been having nightmares about [[Herbie]]. During his [[dream sequence|nightmare sequence]] there is a ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like [[airplane|plane]]s flying around him and squirting [[oil]] until he falls off the [[Empire State Building]]. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape. This ape had a liking to Lois Lane, and in one story climbed up the [[Daily Planet]] building.\n\nKing Kong reached the height of its public visibility in the twentieth century in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of a nostalgic trend to 1930s Hollywood. ''King Kong'' was becoming a cult film with nostalgia value. During this period the character and story of King Kong was most frequently used as a parody in popular culture. The frequency of its use as a parody at this time shows how significant it had become in popular culture.<ref name=Erb/> In the 1968 film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the characters look in a room where a monster ape smashes through a window to get at a screaming woman on a bed. \"Do you think we're interrupting something?\" [[George Harrison|George]] nonchalantly comments of it, to which [[John Lennon|John]] replies, \"I think so.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s RKO began to license a series of King Kong-related products in response to a heavy demand from the public. These products included comic books, games, models, and posters. In 1969 most of the censored shots were found. In 1971 a version of ''King Kong'' with these long-missing portions returned to their proper places was released to [[art house]]s.\n\nReferences to King Kong in popular culture have been widespread since the 1960s. The references have different tones, with some being parodies while others are parodies or oppositional critiques. Some of these references are fleeting (for example, [[Frank Zappa]] named one of his more complex compositions with the Mothers of Invention after Kong), but nevertheless are evidence of King Kong's importance in popular culture. King Kong has been cited in films such as ''[[Morgan!]]'' (1966), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' (1987).<ref name=Erb/> In ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the song \"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\" pays homage to King Kong with the lyric: \"Then something went wrong for [[Fay Wray]] and King Kong ... they got caught in a celluloid jam.\" At the end of the film, Rocky carries Dr. Frankenfurter on the RKO logo, replicating what King Kong carrying Fay Wray in the climax of King Kong.\n\nIn 1965 ''[[Monocle (satirical magazine)|Monocle]]'', a [[political satire]] magazine, cohosted a publisher's party at the Empire State Building with [[Bantam Books]], who were reissuing [[Delos W. Lovelace]]'s novelization of ''King Kong''. A panel of ''Monocle'' satirists was due to give an ironic commentary on ''King Kong'', followed by a screening of the film. One of the titles on the satirists\u2019 program was \"King Kong to Viet Cong: Thirty Years of Gorilla Warfare\". [[Andy Warhol]], who was not on the guest list, used the occasion to generate publicity and create a performance by complaining to the press that ''King Kong'' should be screened with his own film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964). Warhol was permitted to show three minutes of ''Empire'' after ''King Kong''. ''Empire'' was then criticized in the press for being too dull and being upstaged by ''King Kong''.<ref name = Erb/>\n\nBy the 1970s the character of King Kong was constantly referenced in cartoons and jokes. In a 1972 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoon, a man at a cocktail party atop the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] comments that he is impressed that it was \"finished so quickly and without incident,\" while King Kong climbs up the building below him. It was at this time that the film began to be studied by academics and film theoreticians, who found hidden subtexts and symbolic meanings in the film. However, [[Merian C. Cooper]] maintained that the film was nothing more than a simple adventure story.<ref name=Morton/>\n\n[[Thomas Pynchon]], in his post-modern 1973 novel, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', treats the King Kong/[[Ann Darrow]] relationship as an obvious metaphor for Americans' historical racist paranoia of black men dating white women.  He quotes the fictional film reviewer, Mitchel Prettyplace, from his \"definitive 18-volume study of King Kong\", which includes \"even interviews with King Kong Kultists, who to be eligible for the group must have seen the movie at least 100 times and be prepared to pass an 8-hour entrance exam.\"\n\nKing Kong influenced the 1974 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story \"[[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]]\", where the [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]] and his friends in [[UNIT (Doctor Who)|UNIT]] must stop Experimental Prototype Robot K-1 aiding the evil Scientific Reform Society in conquering the world. In homage to King Kong, K-1 falls for the Doctor's friend [[Sarah Jane Smith]], and views her as the one human being it is willing to spare from destruction. When the Doctor is forced to destroy K-1 with a metal-eating virus, Sarah is visibly saddened.\n\nAfter the highly promoted but vastly inferior 1976 remake of ''King Kong'', [[Elliot Stein]] wrote a nostalgic fan homage essay to ''King Kong'' called \"My Life with Kong\" in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Stein was one of the most famous of the \"Kongophiles\" along with [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] and [[Jean Boullet]]. In the essay Stein talks about the contexts in which he has seen ''King Kong'' during his life, including in the 1930s in New York picture palaces like [[Radio City Music Hall]], and the [[RKO Roxy]] and in Paris with Jean Boullet in the 1950s. There was an [[art deco]] retrospective of ''King Kong'' at the Radio City Music Hall in the 1974 and a ''King Kong'' homage was staged for the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in the 1970s.<ref name=Erb/> King Kong was also mentioned by name by [[Kermit the Frog]] in lyrics from the song \"I Hope that Something Better Comes Along\" from ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'': ''\"She made a monkey out of old King Kong/I hope that something better comes along.\"''\n\nAdditionally, King Kong is one of the epithets [[Redd Foxx]]'s character, Fred G. Sanford, from ''[[Sanford and Son (TV series)|Sanford and Son]]'' used referring to his sister-in-law Esther.\n\nThe corpse of King Kong, said to be a leftover prop, appears in the 1978 film ''[[Bye Bye Monkey]]'', where a small [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] is found inside of it.\n\n== King Kong from the 1980s to the present ==\n''King Kong'' was the first film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' was actually the first\u2014although it featured a rampaging ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' rather than a non-science-based monster\u2014but was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film that has been made since 1933. These include ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).<ref name=Jones/> The dinosaur scenes from ''King Kong'' are referenced or mimicked in the three ''Jurassic Park'' films, especially the second film, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'') is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called ''The Venture'', which is the name of the ship in ''King Kong''). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in ''King Kong'', [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character asks, \"What have they got in there, King Kong?\" In the third film in this series, a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' vs. ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' fight is similar to the Kong\u2013rex battle in the original and the second remake.<ref name=Hirschman>Hirschman, Elizabeth C., 2000, ''Heroes, Monster & Messiahs'', Andrews McMeel Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7407-0485-0}}.</ref>\n[[File:kinghomer.jpg|thumb|[[Homer Simpson]] as [[King Kong]]. From the \"King Homer\" segment of \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\".

This image has been copied or parodied in cartoons, comic books, horror films, and television commercials.<ref name=Jones/> A popular television spoof was the segment 'King Homer' from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\", in which the King Kong story was retold featuring ''Simpsons'' characters, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] as Kong, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] as Ann Darrow and [[Mr. Burns]] as [[Carl Denham]]. The spoof follows the plot of the 1933 film closely; however, it ends with Marge marrying King Homer after he collapses in exhaustion, failing to climb beyond the second story of the Springfield State Building. King Kong's family, consisting of smaller apes, appear at the wedding, and Homer has a habit of eating people; at the end he eats Marge's father. King Homer also has a cameo in the music video for \"[[Deep, Deep Trouble]]\" from ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]'' CD, and years later, makes another appearance in the opening [[couch gag]] of \"[[Jazzy and the Pussycats]].\" Homer grabs Marge from the couch and scales the Empire State Building, all while fending off 1930s-style airplanes.<ref name=Erb/> King Homer (or Homer Kong) would reappear battling Bridezilla (a Godzilla version of [[Marge Simpson]]) in the episode \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\". The character also appeared in video games such as ''[[Bart's Nightmare]]'' and ''[[Treehouse of Horror (video game)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' as well as various merchandise such as toys and T-shirts. The original film was referenced again on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode \"[[Monty Can't Buy Me Love]]\", where Mr. Burns captures the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and brings him back to America to entertain an audience; however, instead of the Monster going berserk during its debut, Burns himself is startled by the flash photography and causes the carnage.<ref name=Snpp>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911091156/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 |date=2007-09-11 }} episode capsule at [[The Simpsons Archive]].</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]'' episode \"Hostile Makeover\", Jenny is turned into a Neanderthal and gorilla-like monster; when the cameras flashed their lights to take pictures of her, she roared.\n\nIn the second ''[[Futurama]]'' film, ''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]'' Richard Nixon's head remarks about an alien invasion that King Kong is \"too old to save us this time\", and the camera pans to an elderly King Kong holding Ann Darrow's skeleton.\n\nKing Kong is often used in commercial culture, for example in advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Energizer Batteries]].<ref name=Erb/><ref name=Morton/> A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life.<ref name=Morton/> A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) to get rid of the [[Energizer Bunny]] for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with [[biplanes]] flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling.<ref name=Sweet>Sweet, Leonard, 2001, ''Soultsunami: Sink Or Swim in New Millennium Culture'', Zondervan, {{ISBN|0-310-24312-2}}.</ref> In 1990 [[Kongfrontation]] became one of the original rides at [[Universal Studios Florida]].\n\nThe film character was the inspiration for the 1981 [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and subsequent spin-offs. In the game, the hero must rescue his girlfriend from the [[Donkey Kong (character)|eponymous ape]]. The marauding ape climbs a huge structure after kidnapping the woman, as in the film. The game's creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], intended the name \"Donkey Kong\" to mean \"stubborn gorilla\". [[MCA/Universal]] attempted to sue Nintendo for [[copyright infringement]] in ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'', claiming that the game infringed its copyright for the film. However, they lost and had to pay Nintendo $1.8 million in damages when it was discovered that King Kong was in fact in the [[public domain]] at that time and that MCA/Universal knew this when they filed the lawsuit.
