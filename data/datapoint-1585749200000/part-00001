When he was six, his father died in the disastrous [[Neuruppin]] fire of 1787. He became a student of architect [[Friedrich Gilly]] (1772\u20131800) (the two became close friends) and his father, David Gilly, in [[Berlin]]. After returning to Berlin from his first trip to Italy in 1805, he started to earn his living as a painter. When he saw [[Caspar David Friedrich]]'s painting ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]'' at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Working for the stage, in 1816 he created a star-spangled backdrop for the appearance of the \"K\u00f6nigin der Nacht\" in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', which is even quoted in modern productions of this perennial piece. After Napoleon's defeat, Schinkel oversaw the Prussian Building Commission. In this position, he was not only responsible for reshaping the still relatively unspectacular city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia, but also oversaw projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in the east, such as [[New Altstadt Church]].\n\nFrom 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed [[Schloss Rosenau, Coburg]], in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style.<ref>Charles Quest-Ritson, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=gIYghIYipC8C&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=&f=false Coburg: Schlo\u00df Rosenau]', in ''G\u00e4rten in Deutschland'', p. 64 online (in German)</ref> He also rebuilt the ruins of [[Chorin Abbey]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel Moskowitischer Entwurf Grundriss.tif|thumb|left| Floorplan]]\n[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel - Schlo\u00df am Strom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Castle by the River'' (''Schlo\u00df am Strom'')]]\n[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel - Gotische Kirche auf einem Felsen am Meer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Gotische Kirche auf einem Felsen am Meer'']]\n\nSchinkel's style, in his most productive period, is defined by a turn to Greek rather than Imperial Roman architecture, an attempt to turn away from the style that was linked to the recent French occupiers.

He also carried out improvements to the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace]] and to [[Schloss Charlottenburg]]. Schinkel was also responsible for the interior decoration of a number of private Berlin residences. Although the buildings themselves have long been destroyed portions of a stairwell from the Weydinger House could be rescued and built into the Nicolaihaus on Br\u00fcderstr. and its formal dining hall into the [[Palais am Festungsgraben]].\n\nBetween 1825\u20131827, he collaborated with [[Carl Theodor Ottmer]] on designs for the Berliner Singakademie for [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]].
