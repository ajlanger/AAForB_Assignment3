The community adopts the practices of the positive deviants and their traits improve reasonably. The researchers measure the impact of the adopted practices.\n\nMany of Singhal's written works advocate for expansion of PD approach in addressing issues of public health, malnutrition, social behaviours and education.

Classrooms that incorporate the model allow for equitable student participation, peer-learning, and building of connections, trust, and immediacy.

The researchers measure the impact of the adopted practices.\n\nMany of Singhal's written works advocate for expansion of PD approach in addressing issues of public health, malnutrition, social behaviours and education. Singhal notes that PD has been used to address issues such as malnutrition, eradication of female genital mutilation, human trafficking, increasing school retention rates, and promoting use of condoms among commercial sex workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|date=2010-08-31|title=Communicating What Works!

Classrooms that incorporate the model allow for equitable student participation, peer-learning, and building of connections, trust, and immediacy. The teacher in such a classroom only assumes the role of facilitator instead of a lecturer and helps the group in exploring solutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|last2=Perez|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Stevik|first3=Kristin|last4=M\u00f8nness|first4=Erik|last5=Svenkerud|first5=Peer Jacob|date=2019-12-16|title=Liberating Structures as Pedagogical Innovation for Inclusive Learning: A Pilot Study in a Norwegian University|journal=Journal of Creative Communications|pages=097325861987560|doi=10.1177/0973258619875600|issn=0973-2586}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberatingstructures.com/education|title=Liberating Structures - Education|last=Lipmanowicz|first=Keith McCandless, Henri|website=www.liberatingstructures.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> Although, liberating structures are not limited to classroom settings.
