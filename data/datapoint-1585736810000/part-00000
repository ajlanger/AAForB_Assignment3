It was the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery|first secular nursing school in the world]], and is now part of [[King's College London]]. In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the [[Nightingale Pledge]] taken by new nurses, and the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]], the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual [[International Nurses Day]] is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to [[abolitionism (prostitution)|abolish prostitution laws]] that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the [[workforce]].\n\nNightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in [[plain English|simple English]] so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills. She was also a pioneer in [[data visualization]] with the use of [[infographic]]s, effectively using graphical presentations of [[statistics|statistical]] [[data]].<ref name=\"BBC 2017\"/> Much of her writing, including her extensive work on religion and [[mysticism]], has only been published posthumously.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Embley Park.jpg|thumb|[[Embley Park]] in Hampshire, now a school, was one of the family homes of [[William Nightingale]].]]\nFlorence Nightingale was born on 12&nbsp;May 1820 into a wealthy and well-connected British family at the ''Villa Colombaia'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryjoe.com/nightingale/house.htm |title=The true Florence: Exploring the Italian birthplace of Florence Nightingale |date=1 December 2007 |first=Joy|last=Shiller |accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref>https://jmvh.org/article/florence-nightingale/</ref> in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]], Italy, and was named after the city of her birth. Florence's older sister [[Frances Parthenope Verney|Frances Parthenope]] had similarly been named after her place of birth, ''[[History of Naples|Parthenope]]'', a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] settlement now part of the city of [[Naples]].

She recorded that \"Clarkey\" was a stimulating hostess who did not care for her appearance, and while her ideas did not always agree with those of her guests, \"she was incapable of boring anyone.\" Her behaviour was said to be exasperating and eccentric and she had no respect for upper-class British women, whom she regarded generally as inconsequential. She said that if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave, then she would choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally rejected female company and spent her time with male intellectuals. Clarkey made an exception, however, in the case of the Nightingale family and Florence in particular. She and Florence were to remain close friends for 40&nbsp;years despite their 27&nbsp;year age difference. Clarke demonstrated that women could be equals to men, an idea that Florence had not obtained from her mother.<ref name=cromwell>{{cite book |last1=Cromwell |first1=Judith Lissauer |title=Florence Nightingale, feminist |year=2013 |publisher=McFarland et Company |location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-7864-7092-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/florencenighting0000crom/page/28 28] |url=https://archive.org/details/florencenighting0000crom/page/28 }}</ref>\n\nNightingale underwent the first of several experiences that she believed were calls from God in February&nbsp;1837 while at [[Embley Park]], prompting a strong desire to devote her life to the service of others. In her youth she was respectful of her family's opposition to her working as a nurse, only announcing her decision to enter the field in 1844. Despite the intense anger and distress of her mother and sister, she rebelled against the expected role for a woman of her status to become a wife and mother. Nightingale worked hard to educate herself in the art and science of nursing, in the face of opposition from her family and the restrictive social code for affluent young English women.<ref name=\"Small's bio\">{{cite book |last1=Small |first1=Hugh |title=Florence Nightingale: Avenging Angel |year=1998 |publisher=St.&nbsp;Martin's Press |location=New York |pages=1\u201319}}</ref>\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Augustus Egg.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Nightingale by [[Augustus Egg]], c.&nbsp;1840s]]\nAs a young woman, Nightingale was described as attractive, slender and graceful. While her demeanour was often severe, she was said to be very charming and to possess a radiant smile. Her most persistent suitor was the politician and poet [[Richard Monckton Milnes]], but after a nine-year courtship she rejected him, convinced that marriage would interfere with her ability to follow her calling to nursing.<ref name=\"Small's bio\"/>\n\nIn Rome in 1847, she met [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], a politician who had been [[Secretary at War]] (1845\u20131846) who was on his honeymoon. He and Nightingale became lifelong close friends. Herbert would be Secretary of War again during the [[Crimean War]], when he and his wife would be instrumental in facilitating Nightingale's nursing work in the Crimea. She became Herbert's key adviser throughout his political career, though she was accused by some of having hastened Herbert's death from [[Bright's Disease]] in 1861 because of the pressure her programme of reform placed on him. Nightingale also much later had strong relations with academic [[Benjamin Jowett]], who may have wanted to marry her.<ref>Bostridge, Mark (2008). Florence Nightingale. p. 8.

While in Athens, Greece, Nightingale rescued a juvenile [[little owl]] from a group of children who were tormenting it, and she named the owl Athena. Nightingale often carried the owl in her pocket, until the pet died (soon before Nightingale left for Crimea).<ref>{{cite web |title=Life and death of Florence Nightingale's beloved pet |url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/news/nightingales-owl-in-the-wren/ |website=Trinity College, Cambridge |accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Egypt in particular are testimony to her learning, literary skill, and philosophy of life. Sailing up the Nile as far as Abu Simbel in January&nbsp;1850, she wrote of the [[Abu Simbel temples]], \"Sublime in the highest style of intellectual beauty, intellect without effort, without suffering ... not a feature is correct \u2014 but the whole effect is more expressive of spiritual grandeur than anything I could have imagined.

Nightingale scholar [[Lynn McDonald]] has dismissed these criticisms as \"often preposterous\", arguing they are not supported by the primary sources.<ref name=\"NightingaleCrimeanColectedWorkds\"/>\n\nNightingale still believed that the death rates were due to poor nutrition, lack of supplies, stale air, and overworking of the soldiers.<!-- not consistent with her belief in Miasma theory of disease stated earlier ??? check --> After she returned to Britain and began collecting evidence before the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army, she came to believe that most of the soldiers at the hospital were killed by poor living conditions. This experience influenced her later career, when she advocated sanitary living conditions as of great importance. Consequently, she reduced peacetime deaths in the army and turned her attention to the sanitary design of hospitals and the introduction of sanitation in working-class homes (see Statistics and Sanitary Reform, below).\n\nAccording to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship with her fellow-nurse [[Mary Seacole]], who ran a hotel/hospital for officers. Seacole\u2019s own memoir, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands''\u00b8 records only one, friendly, meeting with her, when she asked her for a bed for the night, and got it; Seacole was in Scutari en route to the Crimea to join her business partner and start their business. However, Seacole pointed out that when she tried to join Nightingale's group, one of Nightingale's colleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole implied that racism was at the root of that rebuttal.<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81</ref> Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter, that she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole\u2019s business, claiming that while \u201cshe was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the Officers \u2013 and did some good (she) made many drunk\u201d.<ref>letter 4&nbsp;August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/59).</ref> Nightingale reportedly wrote, \"I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs Seacole's advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!)...Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct\".<ref>Tan-Feng Chang, CREOLIZING THE WHITE WOMAN\u2019S BURDEN: MARY SEACOLE PLAYING \u201cMOTHER\u201d AT THE COLONIAL CROSSROADS BETWEEN PANAMA AND CRIMEA, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), p. 526.</ref>\n\n=== The Lady with the Lamp ===\n[[File:Florence Nightingale.

Popular lithograph reproduction of a painting of Nightingale by [[Henrietta Rae]], 1891.]]\n\nDuring the [[Crimean war]], Nightingale gained the nickname \"The Lady with the Lamp\" from a phrase in a report in ''[[The Times]]'':\n<blockquote>She is a \"ministering angel\" without any exaggeration in these hospitals, and as her slender form glides quietly along each corridor, every poor fellow's face softens with gratitude at the sight of her.

T. ''The Life of Florence Nightingale.'' (1913) Vol 1, p 237.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe phrase was further popularised by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s 1857 poem \"Santa Filomena\":<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/poetry/nov1857/filomena.htm |date=November 1857 |title=Santa Filomena |author=Henry Wadsworth Longfellow |pages=22\u201323 |work=The Atlantic Monthly |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n::<blockquote><poem>Lo! in that house of misery\nA lady with a lamp I see\nPass through the glimmering gloom,\nAnd flit from room to room.</poem></blockquote>\n\n== Later career ==\nIn the [[Crimea]] on 29&nbsp;November 1855, the Nightingale Fund was established for the training of nurses during a public meeting to recognise Nightingale for her work in the war. There was an outpouring of generous donations. Sidney Herbert served as honorary secretary of the fund and the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] was chairman. Nightingale was considered a pioneer in the concept of ''[[medical tourism]]'' as well, based on her 1856 letters describing spas in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She detailed the health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information, and other vital details of patients whom she directed there. The treatment there was significantly less expensive than in Switzerland.\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Goodman, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nightingale, c.&nbsp;1858, by Goodman]]\n\nNightingale had \u00a345,000 at her disposal from the Nightingale Fund to set up the Nightingale Training School at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] on 9&nbsp;July 1860. The first trained Nightingale nurses began work on 16&nbsp;May 1865 at the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. Now called the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery]], the school is part of [[King's College London]]. She also campaigned and raised funds for the [[Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] near her sister's home, [[Claydon House]].\n\nNightingale wrote ''[[Notes on Nursing]]'' (1859). The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools, though it was written specifically for the education of those nursing at home. Nightingale wrote, \"Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have \u2013 distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have\".<ref name=\"FlorenceNightingale\">{{cite book |title=Notes on Nursing: What it is and what it is not |last=Nightingale |first=Florence |chapter=Preface |year=1974 |orig-year=1859 |publisher=Blackie & Son Ltd. |location= Glasgow and London  |isbn=978-0-216-89974-2}}</ref> \n\n''Notes on Nursing'' also sold well to the general reading public and is considered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the rest of her life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In the introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the Nightingale School of Nursing wrote: \"The book was the first of its kind ever to be written.

Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Nightingale]]\nAs [[Mark Bostridge]] has demonstrated, one of Nightingale's signal achievements was the introduction of trained nurses into the [[workhouse]] system in Britain from the 1860s onwards.<ref name=\"Bostridge\"/> This meant that sick paupers were no longer being cared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing staff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former servants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn their living by this work. [[Charles Dickens]] caricatured the standard of care in his 1842\u20131843 published novel ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' in the figure of [[Sarah Gamp]] as being incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline Worthington, director of the [[Florence Nightingale Museum]], \"When she [Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens character Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking after her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of last resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood. Florence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access to people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was stubborn, opinionated and forthright but she had to be those things in order to achieve all that she did.\"<ref name=\"Express\"/>\n\nThough Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection for her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees,<ref name=\"Bostridge\">''Florence Nightingale, the Woman and her Legend'', by Mark Bostridge (Viking, 2008)</ref> saying that she was simply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as [[Contingent contagionism|contagionism]]. This theory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the experiments of the mid-1860s by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]], hardly anyone took germ theory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were unconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an article for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she said, to kill germs. Nightingale's work served as an inspiration for nurses in the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] government approached her for advice in organising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]].\n[[File:Florence nightingale at st thomas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Florence Nightingale (middle) in 1886 with her graduating [[Florence nightingale school of nursing and midwifery|class of nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']] outside [[Claydon House]], Buckinghamshire]]\nIn the 1870s, Nightingale mentored [[Linda Richards]], \"America's first trained nurse\", and enabled her to return to the United States with adequate training and knowledge to establish high-quality nursing schools.<ref>{{cite book |title=Role Development for Doctoral Advanced Nursing Practice |date=15 December 2010 |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |page=325}}</ref> Richards went on to become a nursing pioneer in the US and Japan.<ref>Linda Richards (1915) [https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesli02richgoog ''Reminiscences of Linda Richards''], Whitcomb & Barrows, Boston {{oclc|1350705}}</ref>\n\nBy 1882, several Nightingale nurses had become matrons at several leading hospitals, including, in London ([[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]], Westminster Hospital, St&nbsp;Marylebone Workhouse Infirmary and the [[Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability|Hospital for Incurables]] at [[Putney]]) and throughout Britain ([[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]], [[Netley]]; [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh|Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]; Cumberland Infirmary and Liverpool Royal Infirmary), as well as at [[Sydney Hospital]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bicentenary of a hospital built from a rum deal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bicentenary-of-a-hospital-built-from-a-rum-deal-20111028-1moaj.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Nightingale became the first recipient of the [[Royal Red Cross]].

Strachey included it in ''The Cause'', a history of the women's movement. Apparently, the writing served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left soon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at [[Kaiserswerth]].\n\n\"Cassandra\" protests the over-feminisation of women into near helplessness, such as Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic lifestyle, despite their education. She rejected their life of thoughtless comfort for the world of social service. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were [[Cassandra]]'s. Cassandra was a princess of [[Troy]] who served as a priestess in the temple of [[Apollo]] during the [[Trojan War]]. The god gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]; when she refused his advances, he cursed her so that her prophetic warnings would go unheeded.

She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against Christians of different denominations, and against those of non-Christian religions.\nNightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work, and would ensure the nurses in her care attended religious services. However she was often critical of organised religion. She disliked the role the 19th century Church of England would sometimes play in worsening the oppression of the poor. Nightingale argued that secular hospitals usually provided better care than their religious counterparts. While she held that the ideal health professional should be inspired by a religious as well as professional motive, she said that in practice many religiously motivated health workers were concerned chiefly in securing their own salvation, and that this motivation was inferior to the professional desire to deliver the best possible care.<ref name=\"NightingaleonMysticism\" /><ref name=\"NightingaleonWomen\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Nursing ===\n[[File:Nightingaleplaque.JPG|thumb|left|210px|[[Blue plaque]] for Nightingale in [[South Street, Mayfair|South Street]], [[Mayfair]], London]]\nNightingale's lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern nursing profession.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 |title=The Nurse's Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion |journal=Fashion Theory |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=523\u2013552 |year=2017 |last1=Hardy |first1=Susan |last2=Corones |first2=Anthony}}</ref> She set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration.

It was the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery|first secular nursing school in the world]], and is now part of [[King's College London]]. In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the [[Nightingale Pledge]] taken by new nurses, and the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]], the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual [[International Nurses Day]] is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to [[abolitionism (prostitution)|abolish prostitution laws]] that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the [[workforce]].\n\nNightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in [[plain English|simple English]] so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills. She was also a pioneer in [[data visualization]] with the use of [[infographic]]s, effectively using graphical presentations of [[statistics|statistical]] [[data]].<ref name=\"BBC 2017\"/> Much of her writing, including her extensive work on religion and [[mysticism]], has only been published posthumously.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Embley Park.jpg|thumb|[[Embley Park]] in Hampshire, now a school, was one of the family homes of [[William Nightingale]].]]\nFlorence Nightingale was born on 12&nbsp;May 1820 into a wealthy and well-connected British family at the ''Villa Colombaia'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryjoe.com/nightingale/house.htm |title=The true Florence: Exploring the Italian birthplace of Florence Nightingale |date=1 December 2007 |first=Joy|last=Shiller |accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref>https://jmvh.org/article/florence-nightingale/</ref> in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]], Italy, and was named after the city of her birth.

She recorded that \"Clarkey\" was a stimulating hostess who did not care for her appearance, and while her ideas did not always agree with those of her guests, \"she was incapable of boring anyone.\" Her behaviour was said to be exasperating and eccentric and she had no respect for upper-class British women, whom she regarded generally as inconsequential. She said that if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave, then she would choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally rejected female company and spent her time with male intellectuals. Clarkey made an exception, however, in the case of the Nightingale family and Florence in particular. She and Florence were to remain close friends for 40&nbsp;years despite their 27&nbsp;year age difference. Clarke demonstrated that women could be equals to men, an idea that Florence had not obtained from her mother.<ref name=cromwell>{{cite book |last1=Cromwell |first1=Judith Lissauer |title=Florence Nightingale, feminist |year=2013 |publisher=McFarland et Company |location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-7864-7092-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/florencenighting0000crom/page/28 28] |url=https://archive.org/details/florencenighting0000crom/page/28 }}</ref>\n\nNightingale underwent the first of several experiences that she believed were calls from God in February&nbsp;1837 while at [[Embley Park]], prompting a strong desire to devote her life to the service of others. In her youth she was respectful of her family's opposition to her working as a nurse, only announcing her decision to enter the field in 1844. Despite the intense anger and distress of her mother and sister, she rebelled against the expected role for a woman of her status to become a wife and mother. Nightingale worked hard to educate herself in the art and science of nursing, in the face of opposition from her family and the restrictive social code for affluent young English women.<ref name=\"Small's bio\">{{cite book |last1=Small |first1=Hugh |title=Florence Nightingale: Avenging Angel |year=1998 |publisher=St.&nbsp;Martin's Press |location=New York |pages=1\u201319}}</ref>\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Augustus Egg.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Nightingale by [[Augustus Egg]], c.&nbsp;1840s]]\nAs a young woman, Nightingale was described as attractive, slender and graceful.

Her most persistent suitor was the politician and poet [[Richard Monckton Milnes]], but after a nine-year courtship she rejected him, convinced that marriage would interfere with her ability to follow her calling to nursing.<ref name=\"Small's bio\"/>\n\nIn Rome in 1847, she met [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], a politician who had been [[Secretary at War]] (1845\u20131846) who was on his honeymoon. He and Nightingale became lifelong close friends. Herbert would be Secretary of War again during the [[Crimean War]], when he and his wife would be instrumental in facilitating Nightingale's nursing work in the Crimea. She became Herbert's key adviser throughout his political career, though she was accused by some of having hastened Herbert's death from [[Bright's Disease]] in 1861 because of the pressure her programme of reform placed on him. Nightingale also much later had strong relations with academic [[Benjamin Jowett]], who may have wanted to marry her.<ref>Bostridge, Mark (2008). Florence Nightingale. p. 8.

Ten times more soldiers died from illnesses such as [[typhus]], [[typhoid]], [[cholera]], and [[dysentery]] than from battle wounds.

Nightingale scholar [[Lynn McDonald]] has dismissed these criticisms as \"often preposterous\", arguing they are not supported by the primary sources.<ref name=\"NightingaleCrimeanColectedWorkds\"/>\n\nNightingale still believed that the death rates were due to poor nutrition, lack of supplies, stale air, and overworking of the soldiers.<!-- not consistent with her belief in Miasma theory of disease stated earlier ??? check --> After she returned to Britain and began collecting evidence before the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army, she came to believe that most of the soldiers at the hospital were killed by poor living conditions. This experience influenced her later career, when she advocated sanitary living conditions as of great importance. Consequently, she reduced peacetime deaths in the army and turned her attention to the sanitary design of hospitals and the introduction of sanitation in working-class homes (see Statistics and Sanitary Reform, below).\n\nAccording to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship with her fellow-nurse [[Mary Seacole]], who ran a hotel/hospital for officers. Seacole\u2019s own memoir, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands''\u00b8 records only one, friendly, meeting with her, when she asked her for a bed for the night, and got it; Seacole was in Scutari en route to the Crimea to join her business partner and start their business. However, Seacole pointed out that when she tried to join Nightingale's group, one of Nightingale's colleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole implied that racism was at the root of that rebuttal.<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81</ref> Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter, that she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole\u2019s business, claiming that while \u201cshe was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the Officers \u2013 and did some good (she) made many drunk\u201d.<ref>letter 4&nbsp;August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/59).</ref> Nightingale reportedly wrote, \"I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs Seacole's advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!)...Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct\".<ref>Tan-Feng Chang, CREOLIZING THE WHITE WOMAN\u2019S BURDEN: MARY SEACOLE PLAYING \u201cMOTHER\u201d AT THE COLONIAL CROSSROADS BETWEEN PANAMA AND CRIMEA, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), p. 526.</ref>\n\n=== The Lady with the Lamp ===\n[[File:Florence Nightingale.

There was an outpouring of generous donations. Sidney Herbert served as honorary secretary of the fund and the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] was chairman. Nightingale was considered a pioneer in the concept of ''[[medical tourism]]'' as well, based on her 1856 letters describing spas in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She detailed the health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information, and other vital details of patients whom she directed there. The treatment there was significantly less expensive than in Switzerland.\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Goodman, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nightingale, c.&nbsp;1858, by Goodman]]\n\nNightingale had \u00a345,000 at her disposal from the Nightingale Fund to set up the Nightingale Training School at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] on 9&nbsp;July 1860. The first trained Nightingale nurses began work on 16&nbsp;May 1865 at the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. Now called the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery]], the school is part of [[King's College London]]. She also campaigned and raised funds for the [[Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] near her sister's home, [[Claydon House]].\n\nNightingale wrote ''[[Notes on Nursing]]'' (1859). The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools, though it was written specifically for the education of those nursing at home. Nightingale wrote, \"Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have \u2013 distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have\".<ref name=\"FlorenceNightingale\">{{cite book |title=Notes on Nursing: What it is and what it is not |last=Nightingale |first=Florence |chapter=Preface |year=1974 |orig-year=1859 |publisher=Blackie & Son Ltd. |location= Glasgow and London  |isbn=978-0-216-89974-2}}</ref> \n\n''Notes on Nursing'' also sold well to the general reading public and is considered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the rest of her life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In the introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the Nightingale School of Nursing wrote: \"The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons.

Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Nightingale]]\nAs [[Mark Bostridge]] has demonstrated, one of Nightingale's signal achievements was the introduction of trained nurses into the [[workhouse]] system in Britain from the 1860s onwards.<ref name=\"Bostridge\"/> This meant that sick paupers were no longer being cared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing staff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former servants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn their living by this work. [[Charles Dickens]] caricatured the standard of care in his 1842\u20131843 published novel ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' in the figure of [[Sarah Gamp]] as being incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline Worthington, director of the [[Florence Nightingale Museum]], \"When she [Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens character Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking after her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of last resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood. Florence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access to people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was stubborn, opinionated and forthright but she had to be those things in order to achieve all that she did.\"<ref name=\"Express\"/>\n\nThough Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection for her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees,<ref name=\"Bostridge\">''Florence Nightingale, the Woman and her Legend'', by Mark Bostridge (Viking, 2008)</ref> saying that she was simply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as [[Contingent contagionism|contagionism]]. This theory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the experiments of the mid-1860s by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]], hardly anyone took germ theory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were unconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an article for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she said, to kill germs. Nightingale's work served as an inspiration for nurses in the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] government approached her for advice in organising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]].\n[[File:Florence nightingale at st thomas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Florence Nightingale (middle) in 1886 with her graduating [[Florence nightingale school of nursing and midwifery|class of nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']] outside [[Claydon House]], Buckinghamshire]]\nIn the 1870s, Nightingale mentored [[Linda Richards]], \"America's first trained nurse\", and enabled her to return to the United States with adequate training and knowledge to establish high-quality nursing schools.<ref>{{cite book |title=Role Development for Doctoral Advanced Nursing Practice |date=15 December 2010 |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |page=325}}</ref> Richards went on to become a nursing pioneer in the US and Japan.<ref>Linda Richards (1915) [https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesli02richgoog ''Reminiscences of Linda Richards''], Whitcomb & Barrows, Boston {{oclc|1350705}}</ref>\n\nBy 1882, several Nightingale nurses had become matrons at several leading hospitals, including, in London ([[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]], Westminster Hospital, St&nbsp;Marylebone Workhouse Infirmary and the [[Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability|Hospital for Incurables]] at [[Putney]]) and throughout Britain ([[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]], [[Netley]]; [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh|Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]; Cumberland Infirmary and Liverpool Royal Infirmary), as well as at [[Sydney Hospital]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bicentenary of a hospital built from a rum deal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bicentenary-of-a-hospital-built-from-a-rum-deal-20111028-1moaj.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Nightingale became the first recipient of the [[Royal Red Cross]].

Despite her symptoms, she remained phenomenally productive in social reform. During her bedridden years, she also did pioneering work in the field of hospital planning, and her work propagated quickly across Britain and the world.

In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation. Two years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its own study in 1863. \"After 10&nbsp;years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per&nbsp;1,000\".<ref name=Cohen1984/>{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868\u20131869 presented Nightingale with an opportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses.

Bernard Cohen]] argues:\n{{cquote| Nightingale's achievements are all the more impressive when they are considered against the background of social restraints on women in Victorian England. Her father, William Edward Nightingale, was an extremely wealthy landowner, and the family moved in the highest circles of English society. In those days, women of Nightingale's class did not attend universities and did not pursue professional careers; their purpose in life was to marry and bear children. Nightingale was fortunate. Her father believed women should be educated, and he personally taught her Italian, Latin, Greek, philosophy, history and \u2013 most unusual of all for women of the time \u2013 writing and mathematics.<ref name=Cohen1984/>{{rp|page=98}} }} [[Lytton Strachey]] was famous for his book debunking 19th century heroes, ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' (1918). Nightingale gets a full chapter, but instead of debunking her, Strachey praised her in a way that raised her national reputation and made her an icon for English feminists of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>James Southern, \"A Lady 'in Proper Proportions'?

She wrote some 200&nbsp;books, pamphlets and articles throughout her life.<ref name=\"Express\"/> During 1850 and 1852, she was struggling with her self-definition and the expectations of an upper-class marriage from her family. As she sorted out her thoughts, she wrote ''Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth''.

Strachey included it in ''The Cause'', a history of the women's movement. Apparently, the writing served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left soon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at [[Kaiserswerth]].\n\n\"Cassandra\" protests the over-feminisation of women into near helplessness, such as Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic lifestyle, despite their education. She rejected their life of thoughtless comfort for the world of social service. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were [[Cassandra]]'s. Cassandra was a princess of [[Troy]] who served as a priestess in the temple of [[Apollo]] during the [[Trojan War]]. The god gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]; when she refused his advances, he cursed her so that her prophetic warnings would go unheeded.

Her biblical annotations, private journal notes and translations of the mystics give quite a different impression of her beliefs, and these do have a bearing on her work with nurses, and not only at Edinburgh, but neither [Cecil Woodham-]Smith nor his [sic \u2014 [[Cecil Woodham-Smith|C.W.-S.]] was a woman] followers consulted their sources.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Lynn |last=McDonald |title=Florence Nightingale: Extending nursing |page=11}}{{full citation|date=January 2020}}</ref>}} She wrote a work of theology: ''Suggestions for Thought'', her own [[theodicy]], which develops her heterodox ideas. Nightingale questioned the goodness of a God who would condemn souls to hell, and was a believer in [[universal reconciliation]] \u2013 the concept that even those who die without being saved will eventually make it to Heaven.{{efn|While this has changed by the 21st&nbsp;century, ''[[universal reconciliation]]'' was very far from being mainstream in the [[Church of England]] at the time.}} She would sometimes comfort those in her care with this view. For example, a dying young prostitute being tended by Nightingale was concerned she was going to hell, and said to her \"Pray God, that you may never be in the despair I am in at this time\". The nurse replied \"Oh, my girl, are you not now more merciful than the God you think you are going to?

She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against Christians of different denominations, and against those of non-Christian religions.\nNightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work, and would ensure the nurses in her care attended religious services. However she was often critical of organised religion. She disliked the role the 19th century Church of England would sometimes play in worsening the oppression of the poor. Nightingale argued that secular hospitals usually provided better care than their religious counterparts. While she held that the ideal health professional should be inspired by a religious as well as professional motive, she said that in practice many religiously motivated health workers were concerned chiefly in securing their own salvation, and that this motivation was inferior to the professional desire to deliver the best possible care.<ref name=\"NightingaleonMysticism\" /><ref name=\"NightingaleonWomen\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Nursing ===\n[[File:Nightingaleplaque.JPG|thumb|left|210px|[[Blue plaque]] for Nightingale in [[South Street, Mayfair|South Street]], [[Mayfair]], London]]\nNightingale's lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern nursing profession.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 |title=The Nurse's Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion |journal=Fashion Theory |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=523\u2013552 |year=2017 |last1=Hardy |first1=Susan |last2=Corones |first2=Anthony}}</ref> She set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration.

She later transferred to a mule cart and was reported to have escaped serious injury when the cart was toppled in an accident. Following this, she used a solid Russian-built carriage, with a waterproof hood and curtains. The carriage was returned to England by [[Alexis Soyer]] after the war and subsequently given to the Nightingale training school. The carriage was damaged when the hospital was bombed during the Second World War. It was restored and transferred to the [[Army Medical Services Museum]], now in [[Mytchett]], Surrey, near [[Aldershot]].\n\nA bronze plaque, attached to the plinth of the Crimean Memorial in the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Cemetery]], Istanbul, Turkey and unveiled on [[Empire Day]], 1954, to celebrate the 100th&nbsp;anniversary of her nursing service in that region, bears the inscription: \"To Florence Nightingale, whose work near this Cemetery a century ago relieved much human suffering and laid the foundations for the nursing profession.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/admin/files/cwgc_haidar.pdf |title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission Haidar Pasha Cemetery |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> Other monuments of Nightingale include a statue at [[Chiba University]] in Japan, and a bust at [[Tarlac State University]] in the Philippines.\n\n=== Audio ===\nFlorence Nightingale's voice was saved for posterity in a [[phonograph]] recording from 1890 preserved in the [[British Library Sound Archive]].

In 1911, [[Edward Tyas Cook]] was authorised by Nightingale's executors to write the official life, published in two volumes in 1913. Nightingale was also the subject of one of [[Lytton Strachey]]'s four mercilessly provocative biographical essays, ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''. Strachey regarded Nightingale as an intense, driven woman who was both personally intolerable and admirable in her achievements.<ref>Florence Nightingale, Monica E. Baly and H. C. G. Matthew, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 2015.</ref>\n\n[[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], like Strachey, relied heavily on Cook's ''Life'' in her 1950 biography, though she did have access to new family material preserved at Claydon. In 2008, [[Mark Bostridge]] published a major new life of Nightingale, almost exclusively based on unpublished material from the Verney Collections at Claydon and from archival documents from about 200 archives around the world, some of which had been published by Lynn McDonald in her projected sixteen-volume edition of the ''Collected Works of Florence Nightingale'' (2001 to date).<ref name=\"BBC 2017\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\n[[File:KLM MD 11 AMS.jpg|thumbnail|left|alt=A three-engine wide-body jet airliner in blue and gray livery|[[KLM]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], registration PH-KCD, ''Florence Nightingale'']]\nIn 2002, Nightingale was ranked number&nbsp;52 in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.
