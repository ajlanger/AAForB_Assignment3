Leg 1 introduced the Hazard, a penalty that one team incurred for being the last team to finish the Starting Line task.

She and teammate Lisa returned to the station to search for the passport but could not find it and opted to proceed to the airport in the hope that another racer had picked it up. The camera crew accompanying the team had seen the dropped passport, but could not tell Kaylani or Lisa or otherwise act on it and instead informed the producers of the situation. The producers prepared to conduct an impromptu elimination and host Phil Keoghan rushed to the airport. The passport was found by two bystanders who had previously helped another team at the gas station. After posting about the incident on [[Twitter]], a fan of the show advised them to take the passport to the airport, and they were able to return it to Kaylani before her scheduled flight.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/twitters-amazing-race-assist/?scp=1&sq=amazing%20race&st=cse | title = Twitter's 'Amazing Race' Assist | first = Brian | last = Stelter | date = 2011-09-26 | accessdate = 2011-09-26 | work = [[New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of The Amazing Race (American TV series) contestants}}\n[[File:TAR19 racers.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the contestants of the 19th season at the season finale \"TARCon\" event in New York City.

Once they got the proverb right, they received their next clue.

When combined twice with their clue of six other letters (\"WANPEI\"), it revealed the name of their first destination: Taipei, Taiwan. Once they presented Phil with the correct umbrella, he would give them keys to one of 11 [[Ford Explorer]]s parked outside the temple.

Leg 1 introduced the Hazard, a penalty that one team incurred for being the last team to finish the Starting Line task.

She and teammate Lisa returned to the station to search for the passport but could not find it and opted to proceed to the airport in the hope that another racer had picked it up. The camera crew accompanying the team had seen the dropped passport, but could not tell Kaylani or Lisa or otherwise act on it and instead informed the producers of the situation. The producers prepared to conduct an impromptu elimination and host Phil Keoghan rushed to the airport. The passport was found by two bystanders who had previously helped another team at the gas station. After posting about the incident on [[Twitter]], a fan of the show advised them to take the passport to the airport, and they were able to return it to Kaylani before her scheduled flight.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/twitters-amazing-race-assist/?scp=1&sq=amazing%20race&st=cse | title = Twitter's 'Amazing Race' Assist | first = Brian | last = Stelter | date = 2011-09-26 | accessdate = 2011-09-26 | work = [[New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of The Amazing Race (American TV series) contestants}}\n[[File:TAR19 racers.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the contestants of the 19th season at the season finale \"TARCon\" event in New York City.

Once there, teams could retrieve their next clue from one of the pigeons.\n*The clue teams obtained from the pigeon was simply a picture of the [[Atomium]], which teams had to figure out in order to find the Pit Stop for this leg.\n\n===Leg 11 (Belgium \u2192 Netherlands \u2192 Panama)===\n[[File:Torre de la Catedral - Flickr - Chito.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]] in [[Panama City]] served as the Pit Stop on the penultimate leg of the Race.]]\n'''Airdate''': December 4, 2011\n*Brussels (Rue de l'\u00c9tuve \u2013 ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' Mural)\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Brussels (Brussels-South Railway Station) to [[Haarlemmermeer]], '''[[Netherlands]]''' {{flagicon|NED}} ([[Schiphol Airport railway station|Schiphol Airport Railway Station]])\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Amsterdam metropolitan area|Amsterdam]] ([[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]) to [[Panama City]], '''[[Panama]]''' {{flagicon|PAN}} ([[Tocumen International Airport]])\n*{{TAR travel|boat}} [[Chagres National Park]] (Puerto El Corotu to Parara Puru) (Overnight Rest)\n*{{TAR travel|boat}} Chagres National Park (Parara Puru to Puerto El Corotu)\n*Panama City ([[San Francisco, Panam\u00e1|San Francisco]] \u2013 San Francisco Bay Towers) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to walk on rarefied air?}}\n*Panama City ([[Casco Viejo, Panama|Casco Viejo]] ([[Casco Viejo, Panama#Main sights|Plaza de Francia]] \u2013 [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] Statue))\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Filet|Sole}} Panama City (El Mercado de Mariscos ''or'' Salsipuedes Market)\n*Panama City ([[Cathedral Basilica of St. Mary (Panama City)|Cathedral Square]])\n*Panama City ([[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|11}}\n\nFor this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to cross a [[tightrope]] between the San Francisco Bay Towers, 35 stories high and {{convert|65|ft|m}} across. The racer picked up their clue on the other tower and then made the trip back to the first tower before they could continue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between Filet and Sole. In Filet, teams traveled to Panama's largest [[fish market]], El Mercado de Mariscos, where they had to deliver fish to different marked stalls throughout the market. Each stall only accepted a certain kind of fish up to a certain weight. Once they were done with their deliveries, the [[fishmonger]] gave them their next clue. In Sole, teams traveled to the Salsipuedes Market where they had to find a [[sandals]] stall and use one piece of leather each to make the sole and strapping for a pair of sandals for a customer. Once the [[Shoemaker|cobbler]] was satisfied, teams received their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*Before leaving Brussels, teams had to dress up as the two bumbling [[Thomson and Thompson|detective characters]] from the popular Belgian ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comics, and figure out one of the three names (\"Thomson and Thompson\", \"Dupond and Dupont\", or \"Johnson and Johnston\") by which the characters are known in Belgium. Then, using a photo given to them with the clue, teams had to find a man dressed as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] standing in front of a Tintin mural and tell him any one of the name variations of the characters they were dressed as in order to receive their next clue.\n*At Parara Puru, teams signed up for one of four times the next morning within 15-minute intervals starting at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to receive a temporary [[tattoo]] that would reveal their next location: the San Francisco Bay Towers in Panama City.\n*After the Roadblock, teams were given a riddle to search for a man underneath a rooster, directing them to the statue of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] in Plaza de Francia.\n*At Cathedral Square, teams had to find a group of ''[[tamborito]]'' dancers wearing ''[[pollera]]'' dresses and had to find the location of the Pit Stop, [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]], which was etched on the dancers' necklaces and written on one dancer's dress.\n\n===Leg 12 (Panama \u2192 United States)===\n[[File:Atlanta Swan House.jpg|thumb|[[Atlanta]]'s historic [[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]] was the Finish Line for the 19th ''Amazing Race''.]]\n'''Airdate''': December 11, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Panama City (Tocumen International Airport) to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] {{flagicon|Georgia (U.S. state)}}, '''United States''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]])\n*Atlanta ([[Berkshire Hathaway#Flight services|FlightSafety International]])\n*Atlanta ([[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum|Margaret Mitchell House]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who gives a damn?}}\n*Atlanta ([[Turner Field]])\n*Atlanta ([[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop}}\n\nThe final Roadblock required one team member to type out the team's next clue using a [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington 3]] [[typewriter]] to duplicate an example message. The duplicate had to be perfectly straight and neat with no mistakes. Additionally, the typewriters used for the task did not have a key for the number <tt>1</tt>; racers were left to figure out that they had to use the key for the lower-case letter <tt>l</tt> as a substitute.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At FlightSafety International, teams had to pick a [[flight instructor]], who taught them how to operate a [[Learjet]] [[flight simulator]]. They then had to successfully complete a simulated landing at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport from an altitude of {{convert|2500|ft}} in order to obtain the next clue.\n*The clue from FlightSafety International instructed teams to \"find the former residence known as 'The Dump'\", leaving them to figure out that this was a reference to the [[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum|home]] of [[Margaret Mitchell]], author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.\n*After completing the Roadblock, teams had to deduce that the series of three numbers on the clue were a homage to [[Hank Aaron]]: 44 (his [[uniform number]]), 715 (the number of home runs he hit to break the [[List of lifetime home run leaders in Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball home run record]]) and 74 (the [[1974 in baseball|year]] in which he broke the record). From this knowledge, teams had to figure out that they had to go to [[Turner Field]].\n*At Turner Field, teams had to use rock climbing gear to map out the ''Race'' course, excluding Germany and the Netherlands, from start to finish by looping a rope through a series of [[carabiner]]s, each representing a specific country, on a large vertical map. One team member worked on the map while his or her teammate gave help from the ground. Teams were not allowed to use notes while working on the task and the countries on the map were unlabeled. Once the map was looped correctly, teams received their final clue.\n\n==Ratings==\n\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| #\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Airdate\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Episode\n!
