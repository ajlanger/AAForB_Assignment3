This section also delineates the conditions under which LEAs should be given special consideration by the Secretary of Education. Those conditions are: \n\t\n# Demonstration of great need (determined in part by student to counselor, student to social worker and student to school psychologist ratios).\n# Proposal of especially innovative or promising programs.\n# Demonstration of great possibility for replication and dissemination.\n \nThis section also requires that the counseling services for which funds are provided follow certain guidelines. Those guidelines include requirements such as assurances that funds will be spent on programs that will be comprehensive in their approach, serve the needs of all students, increase the availability of services, employ qualified professionals, involve families and communities, evaluate the outcomes of the programs and show an innovative approach to providing services. The section also requires that the office of the Secretary of Education must make a report evaluating the programs that receive funds under the section.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subpart 2 \u2014 Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Programs|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg68.html#sec5421|work=Act of Congress|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Subpart 14, Section 5541: Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems ===\n\nThis section gives the Secretary of Education authority to award grants to and enter into contracts with a Local Education Agency, [[State Education Agency]] and Indian tribe to support programs that expand student access to mental health care through the creation of innovative links between schools and the community mental system. These grants are awarded based on an application process. The section limits these grants to a five-year period and requires that the funds be used by LEAs, SEAs and Indian tribes to expand or improve care for students as well as to provide training for school based and community based professionals (both educators and mental health service providers), consultation and technical assistance for schools and agencies, coordination of services that will fit students' language and cultural background, and evaluation of the programs for which grant money is provided.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEC. 5541.

These grants are application based and required to be directed toward programs that help students to develop emotionally, socially and behaviorally; programs that help to coordinate families working with community-based programs that provide such services; programs that provide other services that support such community-based programs such as transportation services; programs that evaluate the success of such programs, or to provide funding for students to participate in or be evaluated for eligibility for such programs. Other requirements for these grants include that programs must not also be receiving funds from other sources and that the office of the Secretary of Education must evaluate or contract for an outside evaluation for each program that receives a grant.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEC. 5542.
