Originally opened in 1839, the station is located on the former [[Croydon Canal]], which is now a branch of the [[Brighton Main Line]], often known as the Sydenham Corridor. Sydenham falls within [[Travelcard Zone 3]] and is served by [[London Overground]] and [[Southern (Govia Thameslink Railway)|Southern]]. The station is {{miles-chains|6|mi|32|chain|km}} down the line from {{stn|London Bridge}}.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Croydon, Norwood & Woodside RJD 53.jpg|thumb|left|A 1908 [[Railway Clearing House]] map of lines around the [[Brighton Main Line]] between South Croydon and Selhurst / Forest Hill, as well as surrounding lines]]\n\nThe Croydon Canal opened in 1809 linking the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] to [[Croydon]], however the waterway was never successful, and in 1836, it was the first canal to be abandoned by an [[Act of Parliament]]. The alignment was purchased by the [[London and Croydon Railway]], who drained the canal and re-opened as a railway on the 5 June 1839.

Between 1948 and 1982 Sydenham was part of the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]] and following sectorisation, until privatisation, Sydenham became part of the [[Network SouthEast]] sector. Upon privatisation in May 1996, the station management passed to [[Connex South Central]]. Connex was stripped of the franchise due to poor financial management and in 2001, Govia South Central (Southern) took over the franchise and management of the station. Southern remained the sole train provider until 2010, when London Overground took over management of the station and began running trains as part of the [[East London Line]] extension.\n\nSydenham was the first station to serve the area, however, there are, or have been, five other stations in the Sydenham:\n* {{Stnlnk|Lower Sydenham}} on the [[Hayes Line]]\n* {{Stnlnk|Upper Sydenham}} on the now closed [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace (High Level) line]]\n* {{Stnlnk|Sydenham Hill}}, {{Stnlnk|Penge East}} on the {{LUL stations|station=Victoria}} to [[Orpington]] line.\n\n==Station layout==\nLike all intermediate stations between New Cross Gate and Norwood Junction, Sydenham has two platforms, facing two (up and down slow) of the four tracks with the two fast tracks run between the two slow lines. There are three entrances - the ticket office on platform 2 from Sydenham Station Approach, entrance on platform 1 from Peak Hill Gardens and a gate on platform 2 which is not unlocked regularly. A locally owned small cafe named ''On The Hoof'' which also has locations at other stations on the line, is in the main station building.\n\n==Services==\n{{London Overground East London Line |width=360px |collapse=yes }}\n\nSydenham is served by 8 trains in each direction off peak, with additional Southern services at peak hours.
