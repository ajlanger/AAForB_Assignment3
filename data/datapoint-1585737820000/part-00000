Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

His uncle, Lucian Connally, was Walt's predecessor as sheriff, and Branch hopes to be sheriff one day, as well. He was romantically involved with Cady Longmire. After being shot by David Ridges in season two, he is shown during the next season recovering and investigating the attack. He was suspended from the force at the end of season three. \n* [[Cassidy Freeman]] as Cady Longmire is Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm. Later, she works for Jacob Nighthorse, to provide representation to residents on the reservation. She was romantically involved with Branch Connally for a time.

In the series finale, her father convinces her to run for sheriff.\n* [[Adam Bartley]] as Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson is an awkward but hard-working young deputy, who felt unappreciated next to his more senior deputies, the handsome Branch Connally and the former Philadelphia Detective Vic Morretti. His eclectic knowledge and skills have helped solve cases, justifying Walt's hiring him, despite the fact that one reason Walt hired him was as a favor to his father. He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady. In season five, he meets Meg, a local nurse.\n\n===Recurring===\n<!-- Recurring cast is listed in order of credits, and in order of their appearance on the show, as per [[WP:TVCAST]] -->\n* Louanne Stephens as Ruby - dispatcher and manager of the sheriff's office (seasons 1-6).\n* [[Zahn McClarnon]] as Chief Mathias - chief of the Cheyenne reservation's [[Indian tribal police|tribal police]] (seasons 1-6).\n* [[A Martinez]] as Jacob Nighthorse - a local Cheyenne businessman representing the interests of his people (seasons 1-6).

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

His uncle, Lucian Connally, was Walt's predecessor as sheriff, and Branch hopes to be sheriff one day, as well. He was romantically involved with Cady Longmire.

He was suspended from the force at the end of season three. \n* [[Cassidy Freeman]] as Cady Longmire is Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm. Later, she works for Jacob Nighthorse, to provide representation to residents on the reservation. She was romantically involved with Branch Connally for a time.

His eclectic knowledge and skills have helped solve cases, justifying Walt's hiring him, despite the fact that one reason Walt hired him was as a favor to his father. He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady.
