In the northern region of the United States, this usually occurs anywhere from late April until early July. In the southern states, where the largest and healthiest specimens typically inhabit, this process can begin in March and is usually over by June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.takemefishing.org/blog/february-2016/largemouth-bass-spawning-and-fishing-consideration/|title=Largemouth Bass Spawning and Fishing Consideration|last=Whitcomb|first=Andy|date=February 28, 2016|website=TakeMeFishing.org}}</ref> Males create nests by moving debris from the bottom of the body of water using their tails.

After one is found, the two bass swim around the nest together, turning their bodies so that the eggs and sperm that are being released will come in contact on the way down to the nest. Bass will usually spawn twice per spring, with some spawning three or four times, although this is not as common. The male will then guard the nest until the eggs hatch, which can take about 2 to 4 days in the southern U.S and Northern Mexico, and slightly longer in the northern part of its Native Range. Finally, depending on the water temperature, the male will stay with the nest until the infant bass are ready to swim out on their own, which can be about two more weeks after they hatch. After this, the male, female, and newborns will switch to more of a summer mode, in which they then focus more on feeding.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Angling==\n[[File:Caught largemouth bass.jpg|thumb|120px|right|upright|A Largemouth bass caught by an angler]]\n{{Main|Bass fishing}}\n\nLargemouth bass are keenly sought after by [[Fisherman|angler]]s and are noted for the excitement of their 'fight,' meaning how vigorously the fish resists being hauled into the boat or onto shore after being hooked. The fish will often become airborne in their effort to throw the hook, but many say that their cousin species, the [[smallmouth bass]], is even more aggressive.<ref name=\"smallmouth\">[http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/smallmouth/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111021150/http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/smallmouth/index.html|date=November 11, 2013}}</ref> Anglers most often fish for largemouth bass with [[fishing lure|lure]]s such as [[Spinnerbait]], [[plastic worm]]s (and other plastic baits), [[Jig (fishing)|jigs]], [[crankbait]]s, and live bait, such as worms and minnows. A recent trend is the use of large [[swimbait]]s to target trophy bass that often forage on juvenile [[rainbow trout]] in California. Fly fishing for largemouth bass may be done using both topwater and worm imitations tied with natural or synthetic materials. Other live baits, such as frogs or [[crawfish]], can also be productive. In fact, large [[golden shiner]]s are a popular live bait used to catch trophy bass, especially when they are sluggish in the heat of summer or in the cold of winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishingtipsdepot.com/bass-fishing-tips.php |title=Bass Fishing Tips - Tips on How to Catch a Largemouth Bass |publisher=Fishingtipsdepot.com |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref> Largemouth bass usually hang around big patches of weeds and other shallow water cover. These fish are very capable of surviving in a wide variety of climates and waters. They are perhaps, one of the World's most tolerant freshwater fish.\n\nThe world record largemouth according to the [[International Game Fish Association|IGFA]] is shared by Manabu Kurita and George W. Perry. Kurita's bass was caught from [[Lake Biwa]] in Japan on July 2, 2009 and weighed 10.12&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lbs 4 oz.) Perry's bass was caught on June 2, 1932 from Montgomery Lake in Georgia and weighed 10.09&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lbs 4 oz.) This record is shared because the IGFA states a new record must beat the old record by at least 2 ounces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&cn=Bass,%20largemouth |title=IGFA World Record &#124; All Tackle Records &#124; Bass, largemouth |publisher=Wrec.igfa.org |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nStrong cultural pressure among largemouth bass anglers encourages the practice of [[catch and release]], especially the larger specimens, mainly because larger specimens are usually breeding females that contribute heavily to future sport fishing stocks. Largemouth bass, respond well to [[catch and release]], with a very high survival rate after release, especially if the fish is handled with care and is loosely hooked in the side or top of the mouth.{{cn|date=January 2020}} However, if the fish swallows the hook, survival odds greatly decrease. In these situations, death by hooking can be avoided in most cases by simply leaving the hook in the fishes mouth or by using needlenose plyers to gently wiggle the hook free.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Largemouth Bass have a white, slightly mushy meat, lower quality than that of the [[smallmouth bass]], [[bluegill]], [[yellow perch]], [[crappie]] or [[walleye]]. Small largemouth, of 10-14 inches, can contain higher quality meat, especially during the spring.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Invasive species==\nThe largemouth bass has been introduced into many other regions and countries due to its popularity as a sport fish.

Adult largemouth are generally [[apex predator]]s within their habitat, but they are preyed upon by many animals while young.<ref>[http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/largemouth-1]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410031253/http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/largemouth-1|date=April 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nNotably in the [[Great Lakes]] Region, ''Micropterus salmoides'' along with many other species of native fish have been known to prey upon the invasive [[round goby]] (''Neogobius melanostomus''). Remains of said fish have been found inside the stomachs of largemouth bass consistently. This feeding habit may impact the ecosystem positively, but more research must be conducted to verify this. Note that it is illegal to use ''Neogobius melanostomus'' as bait in the Great Lakes Region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(brw3y4554cagkv4554a24a45))/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-451-1994-iii-2-1-wildlife-conservation-413.pdf|title=Excerpt of Michigan's Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act|publisher=Legislature.mi.gov|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Spawning==\n[[File:Largemouth-bass-20170129-cropped.jpg|thumb|Side view of a living largemouth bass]]\nLargemouth bass usually reach sexual maturity and begin spawning when they are about a year old.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/wkrec/LargemouthBassBiology.pdf|title=Largemouth Bass: Biology and Life History|last=Davis, Lock|first=James, Joe|date=August 1997|website=Southern Regional Aquaculture Center}}</ref> Spawning takes place in the spring season when the water temperature first holds steady above 60\u02daF. In the northern region of the United States, this usually occurs anywhere from late April until early July. In the southern states, where the largest and healthiest specimens typically inhabit, this process can begin in March and is usually over by June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.takemefishing.org/blog/february-2016/largemouth-bass-spawning-and-fishing-consideration/|title=Largemouth Bass Spawning and Fishing Consideration|last=Whitcomb|first=Andy|date=February 28, 2016|website=TakeMeFishing.org}}</ref> Males create nests by moving debris from the bottom of the body of water using their tails. These nests are usually about twice the length of the males, although this can vary.<ref name=\":0\" /> Bass prefer sand, muck, or gravel bottoms, but will also use rocky and weedy bottoms where there is cover for their nest, such as roots or twigs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/species/lmbass.html|title=Fishes Of Wisconsin: Largemouth Bass|date=August 31, 2012|website=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources}}</ref> After finishing the nest, the males swim near the nest looking for a female to mate with. After one is found, the two bass swim around the nest together, turning their bodies so that the eggs and sperm that are being released will come in contact on the way down to the nest. Bass will usually spawn twice per spring, with some spawning three or four times, although this is not as common. The male will then guard the nest until the eggs hatch, which can take about 2 to 4 days in the southern U.S and Northern Mexico, and slightly longer in the northern part of its Native Range. Finally, depending on the water temperature, the male will stay with the nest until the infant bass are ready to swim out on their own, which can be about two more weeks after they hatch. After this, the male, female, and newborns will switch to more of a summer mode, in which they then focus more on feeding.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Angling==\n[[File:Caught largemouth bass.jpg|thumb|120px|right|upright|A Largemouth bass caught by an angler]]\n{{Main|Bass fishing}}\n\nLargemouth bass are keenly sought after by [[Fisherman|angler]]s and are noted for the excitement of their 'fight,' meaning how vigorously the fish resists being hauled into the boat or onto shore after being hooked. The fish will often become airborne in their effort to throw the hook, but many say that their cousin species, the [[smallmouth bass]], is even more aggressive.<ref name=\"smallmouth\">[http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/smallmouth/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111021150/http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/smallmouth/index.html|date=November 11, 2013}}</ref> Anglers most often fish for largemouth bass with [[fishing lure|lure]]s such as [[Spinnerbait]], [[plastic worm]]s (and other plastic baits), [[Jig (fishing)|jigs]], [[crankbait]]s, and live bait, such as worms and minnows. A recent trend is the use of large [[swimbait]]s to target trophy bass that often forage on juvenile [[rainbow trout]] in California. Fly fishing for largemouth bass may be done using both topwater and worm imitations tied with natural or synthetic materials. Other live baits, such as frogs or [[crawfish]], can also be productive. In fact, large [[golden shiner]]s are a popular live bait used to catch trophy bass, especially when they are sluggish in the heat of summer or in the cold of winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishingtipsdepot.com/bass-fishing-tips.php |title=Bass Fishing Tips - Tips on How to Catch a Largemouth Bass |publisher=Fishingtipsdepot.com |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref> Largemouth bass usually hang around big patches of weeds and other shallow water cover. These fish are very capable of surviving in a wide variety of climates and waters. They are perhaps, one of the World's most tolerant freshwater fish.\n\nThe world record largemouth according to the [[International Game Fish Association|IGFA]] is shared by Manabu Kurita and George W. Perry. Kurita's bass was caught from [[Lake Biwa]] in Japan on July 2, 2009 and weighed 10.12&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lbs 4 oz.) Perry's bass was caught on June 2, 1932 from Montgomery Lake in Georgia and weighed 10.09&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lbs 4 oz.) This record is shared because the IGFA states a new record must beat the old record by at least 2 ounces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&cn=Bass,%20largemouth |title=IGFA World Record &#124; All Tackle Records &#124; Bass, largemouth |publisher=Wrec.igfa.org |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nStrong cultural pressure among largemouth bass anglers encourages the practice of [[catch and release]], especially the larger specimens, mainly because larger specimens are usually breeding females that contribute heavily to future sport fishing stocks. Largemouth bass, respond well to [[catch and release]], with a very high survival rate after release, especially if the fish is handled with care and is loosely hooked in the side or top of the mouth.{{cn|date=January 2020}} However, if the fish swallows the hook, survival odds greatly decrease. In these situations, death by hooking can be avoided in most cases by simply leaving the hook in the fishes mouth or by using needlenose plyers to gently wiggle the hook free.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Largemouth Bass have a white, slightly mushy meat, lower quality than that of the [[smallmouth bass]], [[bluegill]], [[yellow perch]], [[crappie]] or [[walleye]]. Small largemouth, of 10-14 inches, can contain higher quality meat, especially during the spring.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Invasive species==\nThe largemouth bass has been introduced into many other regions and countries due to its popularity as a sport fish. It causes the decline, displacement or extinctions of species in its new habitat through [[predation]] and competition,<ref>{{Cite web|title = issg Database: Impact Information for Micropterus salmoides|url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/impact_info.asp?si=94&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN|website = www.issg.org|access-date = January 22, 2016}}</ref> for example in Namibia.
