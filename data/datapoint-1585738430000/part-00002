Within the existing base of studies are some reports of positive results.

Another area for which basic experimental research is lacking to support the efficacy of MUA treatment of the low back,<ref name=pmid18164469/> and other spinal regions, relates to the two presiding theories that [A] flexibility of the spine may be increased when adhesions are reduced, and [B] MUA is more effective at treating adhesions than office-based manual therapy methods.  Perhaps of greater significance, the circumstances by which or how often spinal adhesions (scar tissue) may form in the general population, in the presence or absence of prior surgery or vertebral fracture, have not been addressed in the medical literature.<ref name=\"chiromt.biomedcentral.com\">DiGiorgi D, Cerf JL, Bowerman DS.

The shoulder, when failing to achieve flexibility following standard treatment, is one of the extremity regions for which the frozen shoulder condition has traditionally been cited as an indication for MUA.  There are some supportive studies in this area, including one showing that patients fare better with intervention at 6 and 9 months after condition onset (having significantly better abduction and external rotation, with less pain at rest and at night).<ref name=pmid25623916>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1457496914566637 |pmid=25623916 |title=Optimal time for manipulation of frozen shoulder may be between 6 and 9 months |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Surgery |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=260\u20136 |year=2015 |last1=Vastam\u00e4ki |first1=H |last2=Varjonen |first2=L |last3=Vastam\u00e4ki |first3=M }}</ref>  However, for those studies which represent the highest level of research evidence, the results of two recent systematic reviews for frozen shoulder raise question as to treatment superiority when compared to other forms of treatment.

As such, in all likelihood, the risks with the procedure are relatively low or minimized with current techniques and when patients are properly selected and evaluated by the anesthesiologist, the medical physician who is providing medical clearance, and the MUA manual therapy practitioner (DC, DO, MD).

It was largely abandoned due to complications from [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] and due to the type of nonspecific manipulation procedures used. It was modified and revived in the 1990s, primarily by [[chiropractor]]s, and also by osteopathic physicians; this was likely due to safer anesthesia used for [[Sedation|conscious sedation]], along with increased interest in spinal manipulation (SM).<ref name=pmid18164462>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.09.010 |pmid=18164462 |title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with medicine-assisted manipulation |journal=The Spine Journal |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=142\u20139 |year=2008 |last1=Dagenais |first1=Simon |last2=Mayer |first2=John |last3=Wooley |first3=James R |last4=Haldeman |first4=Scott }}</ref>\n\nIn the MUA literature, spinal manipulation under anesthesia has been described as a controversial procedure.<ref>Krumhansl BR, Nowacek CJ.

Within the existing base of studies are some reports of positive results.  However, it appears that as part of the evolution of the procedure, the medical literature reveals many variations in [A] the type of sedatives/medications used, [B] manipulation technique, [C] the number of MUA sessions employed, [D] the span of time between procedure doses (if administered in series), and [E] the types and breadth of application of post-MUA adjunctive and/or rehabilitative measures.<ref name=pmid23672974>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/2045-709X-21-14 |pmid=23672974 |pmc=3691523 |title=Spinal manipulation under anesthesia: A narrative review of the literature and commentary |journal=Chiropractic & Manual Therapies |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=14 |year=2013 |last1=Digiorgi |first1=Dennis }}</ref>\n \nThere has been and remains a strong theoretical basis for spinal MUA.  However, considering the aforementioned differences in existing published studies, field practitioners have not had an objective and uniform means by which to establish evidence-based treatment protocols.<ref name=pmid23672974/> Also, because the preponderance of studies are of lower level evidence<ref name=\"Premera Blue Cross Chiropractic Services\"/><ref name=\"Cigna Manipulation Under Anesthesia\"/> the issue of long-term effectiveness of MUA in the management of specific spinal conditions has yet to be investigated.  Another area for which basic experimental research is lacking to support the efficacy of MUA treatment of the low back,<ref name=pmid18164469/> and other spinal regions, relates to the two presiding theories that [A] flexibility of the spine may be increased when adhesions are reduced, and [B] MUA is more effective at treating adhesions than office-based manual therapy methods.  Perhaps of greater significance, the circumstances by which or how often spinal adhesions (scar tissue) may form in the general population, in the presence or absence of prior surgery or vertebral fracture, have not been addressed in the medical literature.<ref name=\"chiromt.biomedcentral.com\">DiGiorgi D, Cerf JL, Bowerman DS.
