{"title_page": "Rise of Joseph Stalin", "text_new": "{{short description|History of the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist party}}\n[[Joseph Stalin]] was a Georgian born student radical who became a member and eventually a leader of the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. He served as the [[General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 until his [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death]] in 1953. In the years following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], he rose to become dictator of the Soviet Union, using a combination of manipulation and terror to destroy his opposition. \n\nAfter growing up in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Stalin became a political activist, conducting discreet activities for the [[Bolshevik Party]] for twelve years before the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. Following the [[October Revolution]], Stalin took military positions in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. Stalin was one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the [[Caucasus]] and grew close to leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], who saw him as a tough character, and a loyal follower capable of getting things done behind the scenes. Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]], adopting a hardline approach to opposition. Stalin's connections helped him to gain influential positions behind the scenes in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet-Russia]]n government.    \n\nAt the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik Party]]'s 11th Congress, leaders decided to expand the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]. Due to this expansion, a secretariat became a necessity. Stalin was appointed the head of this new office on the 3rd of April 1922. From that date until his death, Stalin's formal title was ''General Secretary''. The office grew with Stalin's aggressive assumption of power, not the other way around. After a brief disappointment of not being given a prestigious ministerial post, Stalin soon learned how to use his new office in order to gain advantages towards other key persons within the Bolshevik Party. He prepared the agenda for the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] meetings, directing the course of meetings. As General Secretary, he appointed new local party leaders, establishing a patronage network of people loyal to him.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''Stalin - a Political Biography'', 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp 184-233</ref>     \n\nOnly a few weeks after his appointment, Lenin was forced into semi-retirement because of a stroke. Lenin never fully recovered and died in January 1924. He spent most of his remaining life resting in a countryside [[Dacha]]. But he received messages and political visitors, and between the autumn of 1922 and spring of 1923, he resumed his party leadership in Moscow. As late as in October 1922, Lenin expressed his \"unreserved support\" for Stalin as General Secretary and for his work with a new constitution. (Adopted in December 1924, it shaped the Soviet Union.) But soon thereafter, and having learned that a number of matters related to brutality, abuse of power and rising internal party struggles had occurred during his absence, Lenin's faith in Stalin faded. Lenin was disturbed by a report on violent atrocities committed in Georgia, reported by the head of the security police [[GPU]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]. He attributed the atrocities to [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]] and associated people. Neither did Lenin approve of Dzerzhinsky, who expressed his support of Stalin, whilst reporting on Georgia to Lenin.<ref>Harrison S.Salisbury,\"Russia in Revolution 1900-1930\", 1978, Swedish {{ISBN|91 29 53057 1}}, p. 264</ref> Further, Stalin had been very unpleasant with Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] on the telephone. Stalin had threatened to have her prosecuted for having disturbed Lenin with political matters during his recovery.<ref>Salisbury, p.266-269 (the book has numerous illustrations.)</ref>\n\nAll of this caused a growing suspicion on Stalin. In December 1922 and early January 1923, Lenin dictated a political will. Historian [[Isaac Deutscher]], who first published reports in 1949 of the terrorism conducted by Stalin, described Lenin's will by the following: \"The whole testament breathed uncertainty\". It contains some hard criticism on Stalin, but sharply criticizes [[Leon Trotsky]]; Lenin primarily expressed a fear of a future fragmentation of the party. <ref>Isaac Deutscher, '''Stalin - a Political Biography'', 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp 198-199</ref>     \n\nAfter [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]], a struggle for power in the party broke out in the open. Stalin, through his office as General Secretary, took advantage of his knowledge of the existing antagonisms among the Bolshevik Party's leaders. Many were members of the Party's supreme organ, the Politburo, but rivalries extended beyond that. Several People's Commissars (or Ministers in other countries) were involved in the Party's internal personal as well as political struggles. [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] represented the intellectual \"[[Left Opposition|left wing]],\" whilst [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Mikhail Tomsky]] and [[Alexei Rykov]] represented the trade unionist \"[[Right Opposition|right wing]]\". But the most prominent Bolshevik after Lenin's death was [[Leon Trotsky]], who led a group of his own. None of these persons would survive Stalin; all died of suspected assassinations.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''Stalin - a Political Biography'', 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, p 203</ref>      \n\nSoon after Lenin's death, Stalin joined Zinoviev and Kamenev in a Politburo Triumvirate. By 1924 they were united in wanting to get rid of the troublesome Trotsky. But this was no easy task. Trotsky had developed the [[Red Army]] and had played a huge role during the [[October Revolution]]. He was intellectually and as orator superior to Stalin. Stalin used Zinoviev and Kamenev to combat Trotsky, while appearing as \"The Golden Centre Man\". There are multiple theories on the hostility between Stalin and Trotsky, and when it began. But a huge ''political'' divider became Stalin's idea of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" vs Trotsky's \"[[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]]\". Stalin's idea, was in the mid-1920s actually revolutionary in itself. The entire Bolshevik concept had been to begin at home, in Russia, and then \"export\" the revolution to the West. By 1925 it had become apparent that all [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolutionary movements in Germany]] and [[Revolutions of 1917-23|elsewhere]] had failed. In Italy even a counter-socialistic movement, [[Fascism]], had come to power. From these perspectives did not that few Bolsheviks suddenly see Stalin's idea as sound when compared to Trotsky's. <ref>Isaac Deutscher, \"Stalin - a Political Biography\", 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp 233-249</ref> Trotsky was first removed as Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs (January 1925), removed from the Politburo (October 1926), removed from the Central Committee (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma\u2013Ata in [[Kazakhstan]] (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). \n\nBut Stalin had canceled the cooperation with Zinoviev and Kamenev a long time before Trotsky's final decline. He slowly but steadily desired to get rid of his two former Triumvirate-companions. During this phase, Stalin instead joined forces with the \"right\" of the Bolshevik Party. Together with Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov, Stalin could now rather easily send Zinoviev and Kamenev to [[Gulag]] (thus far just briefly), and by 1929 also Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov found themselves played by Stalin. All struggles for power were over. Stalin was now the autocratic ruler of the entire Soviet Union. Millions of Russians and people of other ethnic origin inside the Soviet Union had been killed during the [[Russian Civil War]], through starvation and in other conflicts, but the bloodbath had thus far not reached within the Bolshevik Party.\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Early life of Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin in the Russian Revolution, Russian Civil War, and Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n\nBefore his 1913-1917 exile in Siberia, Stalin was one of the Bolshevik operatives in the Caucasus, organizing cells, spreading propaganda, and raising money through criminal activities. Stalin eventually earned a place in Lenin's inner circle and the highest echelons of the Bolshevik hierarchy. His pseudonym, Stalin, means \"man of the steel hand\". The [[October Revolution]] took place in the Russian capital of [[Petrograd]] on 7 November 1917 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 25 October 1917), which saw the transfer of all political power to the Soviets.\n\nIn the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, Stalin forged connections with various Red Army generals and eventually acquired military powers of his own. He brutally suppressed counter-revolutionaries and bandits. After winning the civil war, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with [[Poland]], which was fighting the Red Army in [[Ukraine]]. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine and later in Poland itself, Stalin's [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|actions in the war]] were later criticized by many, including [[Leon Trotsky]].\n\n==Invasion of Georgia and General Secretary==\nIn late 1920, with the crises in society following the [[Russian Civil War]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] argued for the trade unions to be incorporated more and more into the workers' state, and for the workers' state to completely control the industrial sectors. Lenin's position was one where the trade unions were subordinate to the workers' state, but separate, with Lenin accusing Trotsky of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\". Fearing a backlash from the trade unions, Lenin asked Stalin to build a support base in the [[Rabkrin|Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (Rabkrin)]] against bureaucratism.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=186}}</ref> Lenin's faction eventually prevailed at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921. Frustrated by the squabbling factions within the Communist Party during what he saw as a time of crisis, Lenin convinced the Tenth Congress to pass a ban on any opposition to official Central Committee policy (the [[Ban on Factions]], a law which Stalin would later exploit to expel his enemies).<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\">Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-330-41913-0}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\nStalin played a decisive role in engineering the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] in February and March 1921, at a time when Georgia was the biggest [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Menshevik stronghold]]. Following the invasion, Stalin adopted particularly hardline, centralist policies towards [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]], which included severe repression of opposition to the Bolsheviks, and to opposition within the local Communist Party (e.g., the [[Georgian Affair]] of 1922), not to mention any manifestations of [[anti-Soviet]]ism (the [[August Uprising]] of 1924).<ref>Knight, Ami W.

Stalin still held his posts in the [[Orgburo]], the [[Rabkrin|Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate]] and the Commassariat for Nationalities Affairs, though he agreed to delegate his workload to subordinates. With this power, he would steadily place his supporters in positions of authority.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\n==Lenin's retirement and death==\n[[Image:Lenin and stalin crop.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] visiting the ailing [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] at his dacha in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]] in 1922.]]\nOn 25 May 1922, Lenin suffered a stroke while recovering from surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck since a failed assassination attempt in August 1918. Severely debilitated, he went into semi-retirement and moved to his [[dacha]] in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]]. After this, prominent Bolsheviks were concerned about who would take over if Lenin actually died. Lenin and Trotsky had more of a personal and theoretical relationship, while Lenin and Stalin had more of a political and apparatical relationship. Yet, Stalin visited Lenin often, acting as his intermediary with the outside world.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> During this time, the two quarrelled over economic policy and how to consolidate the Soviet republics. One day, Stalin verbally swore at Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], for breaching [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] orders by helping Lenin communicate with [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and others about politics;<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> this greatly offended Lenin. As their relationship deteriorated, Lenin dictated increasingly disparaging notes on Stalin in what would become [[Lenin's Testament|his testament]]. Lenin criticised Stalin's rude manners, excessive power, ambition and politics, and suggested that Stalin should be removed from the position of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]. One of Lenin's secretaries showed Stalin the notes, whose contents shocked him.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> On 9 March 1923, Lenin suffered his most debilitating stroke, which ended his political career.\n\nDuring Lenin's semi-retirement, Stalin forged a [[triumvirate]] alliance with [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] in May 1922, against [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]. These allies prevented [[Lenin's Testament]] from being revealed to the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)|Twelfth Party Congress]] in April 1923.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>  Although Zinoviev and Kamenev were disconcerted by Stalin's power and some of his policies, they needed Stalin's help in opposing Trotsky's faction and to prevent Trotsky's possible succession to Lenin in a power struggle.\n\nLenin died on 21 January 1924. Stalin was given the honour of organizing his funeral. Upon Lenin's death, Stalin was officially hailed as his successor as the leader of the ruling Communist Party and of the Soviet Union itself. Against Lenin's wishes, he was given a lavish funeral and his body was embalmed and put on display.  Thanks to Kamenev and Zinoviev's influence, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] decided that [[Lenin's Testament]] should not be made public. At the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)|Thirteenth Party Congress]] in May 1924, it was read out only to the heads of the provincial delegations. Trotsky did not want to appear divisive so soon after Lenin's death and did not seize the opportunity to demand Stalin's removal.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=223}}</ref>\n\n==Downfall of Trotsky==\n[[File:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u0413\u041f\u0423.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Stalin walks in the streets of Moscow in 1920s]]\nIn the months following Lenin's death, Stalin's disputes with Zinoviev and Kamenev intensified. While the triumvirate remained intact throughout 1924 and the early months of 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev did not regard Stalin highly as a revolutionary theorist, and often disparaged him in private even as they had aided him publicly against Trotsky and the [[Left Opposition]]. For his part, Stalin was cautious about where the political situation was heading, and often felt that Zinoviev's volatile rhetoric against Trotsky was going too far, especially when Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party in January 1925. Stalin opposed Zinoviev's demand, and skillfully played the role of a moderate. At this time, Stalin was allying himself more and more with [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and the [[Right Opposition]], whom Stalin had promoted to the Politburo at the Thirteenth Party Congress. Stalin proposed the theory of [[Socialism in One Country]] in October 1924, which Bukharin soon elaborated upon to give it a theoretical justification. Zinoviev and Kamenev suddenly found themselves in a minority at the Fourteenth Party Conference in April 1925, over their belief that socialism could only be achieved internationally, which resulted in the triumvirate splitting up. This saw a strengthening of Stalin's alliance with Bukharin.\n\nWith Trotsky mostly sidelined with a persistent illness during 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev then formed the [[New Opposition]] against Stalin. At the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|Fourteenth Party Congress]] in December 1925, Stalin openly attacked Kamenev and Zinoviev, revealing that they had asked for his aid in expelling Trotsky from the Communist Party. Stalin's revelation made Zinoviev, in particular, very unpopular with many inside the Communist Party. Trotsky remained silent throughout this Congress.\n\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev and Kamenev drew closer to Trotsky and the Left Opposition, forming an alliance which became known as the [[United Opposition]]. The United Opposition demanded, among other things, greater freedom of expression within the Communist Party and less bureaucracy. In October 1926, Stalin's supporters voted Trotsky out of the Politburo. \n\nDuring the years of 1926 and 1927, Soviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.</ref> resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.<ref>Compilation Group for the \"History of Modern China Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" \u2014 the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, \"The Prospects of Revolution in China\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\" contained in ''J. Stalin on Chinese Revolution'' (Suren Dutt Publishers: Calcutta, India, 1970) pp. 5\u201321.</ref>  Stalin believed that the KMT bourgeoisie, together with all patriotic national liberation forces in the country, would defeat the western imperialists in China.\n\nTrotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCI3gnzsYc0C&pg=PA233&dq=trotsky+squeezed+lemon+chiang&hl=en&ei=d9YjTfu3C4GdlgfNiNHkCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=trotsky%20squeezed%20lemon%20chiang&f=false|title=China in war and revolution, 1895\u20131949|author=Peter Gue Zarrow|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=illustrated|volume=Volume 1 of Asia's transformations|isbn=0-415-36447-7|page=233|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref> Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang's right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that [[Chiang Kai-shek]] had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded.

Attacks against the United Opposition increased in volatility and ferocity. Many supporters of Kamenev and Zinoviev's group, as well as most from the Workers Opposition grouping, had left the United Opposition by mid-1927, changing sides under the growing political pressure and espousing their support for Stalin. Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev grew increasingly isolated and were ejected from the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] in October 1927.\n\nOn 7 November 1927, on the tenth anniversary of the [[October Revolution]], the United Opposition held a demonstration in Red Square, Moscow, along with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s widow, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. On 12 November 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party itself, followed by Kamenev at the Fifteenth Party Congress in December 1927.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> At the Congress, where Kamenev acted as the United Opposition's spokesman due to Trotsky's and Zinoviev's expulsion, the United Opposition were unable to gain the support of more than a small minority of the Communist Party, and they were expelled after the Congress declared United Opposition views to be incompatible with Communist Party membership.\n\nWhile Trotsky remained firm in his opposition to Stalin after his expulsion from the Communist Party and his subsequent exile, Zinoviev and Kamenev capitulated almost immediately, and called on their supporters to follow suit. They wrote open letters acknowledging their mistakes and were readmitted to the Communist Party in June 1928, after a six-month cooling-off period. They never regained their Central Committee seats, but they were given mid-level positions within the Soviet bureaucracy. Kamenev and Zinoviev were courted by Bukharin at the beginning of his short and ill-fated struggle with Stalin in the summer of 1928. This activity was soon reported to Stalin and was later used against Bukharin as proof of his factionalism. Trotsky, firmer than ever in his opposition to Stalin, was exiled to [[Alma-ata]] in January 1928, and was exiled from the Soviet Union itself in February 1929, sent into exile in Turkey. From his exile, Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin, right up until Trotsky was assassinated on Stalin's orders in August 1940.\n\n==Stalin turns on the Right==\n{{also|Stalin's cult of personality}}\n[[File:\u0412 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c 50-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0426\u041a \u0412\u041a\u041f(\u0431) \u0418. \u0412. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430.jpg|thumb|200px| Stalin birthday in 1929.

In January 1928, Stalin personally travelled to Siberia where he oversaw the seizure of grain stockpiles from [[kulak]] farmers.

To prevent a scandal, ''[[Pravda]]'' reported the cause of death as [[appendicitis]].  Stalin did not tell his own children the truth, in order to prevent them from revealing it accidentally.\n\n==The Great Terror==\n{{main|Great Purge}}\n{{Stalinism sidebar}}\nOn 1 December 1934, [[Sergei Kirov]] was murdered by [[Leonid Nikolaev]]. The death of this popular, high-profile politician shocked Russia, and Stalin used this murder to begin [[The Great Purge|The Great Terror]]. Within hours of Kirov's death, Stalin declared [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and his supporters to be responsible for Kirov's murder.<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=160}}</ref>  [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] were arrested and, to escape long prison sentences, confessed to political and moral responsibility for Kirov's murder. In January 1935, Zinoviev was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, and Kamenev was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. Stalin sanctioned the formation of [[NKVD troika|troikas]] for the purpose of extrajudicial punishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=315}}</ref> In April 1935, Kamenev's prison sentence was increased by another 5 years, to a total of 10 years imprisonment.

Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and the senior [[Red Army]] military officers [[Iona Yakir]], [[Ieronim Uborevich]], [[Robert Eideman]], [[August Kork]], [[Vitovt Putna]], [[Boris Feldman]] and [[Vitaly Primakov]] (as well as [[Yakov Gamarnik]], who committed suicide before the investigations began) were accused of [[anti-Soviet]] conspiracy and sentenced to death; they were executed on the night of 11 to 12 June 1937, immediately after the verdict delivered by a Special Session (\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435) of the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]]. The Tribunal was presided over by [[Vasili Ulrikh]] and included marshals [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Semyon Budyonny]] and Army Commanders [[Yakov Alksnis]], [[Boris Shaposhnikov]], [[Ivan Panfilovich Belov]], [[Pavel Dybenko]], and [[Nikolai Kashirin]]. Only Ulrikh, Budyonny and Shaposhnikov would survive the [[purge]]s that followed. The [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky|Tukhachevsky]] trial triggered a massive subsequent purge of the [[Red Army]]. In September 1938, the People's Commissar for Defence, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], reported that a total of 37,761 officers and [[commissar]]s were dismissed from the army, 10,868 were arrested and 7,211 were condemned for anti-Soviet crimes.\n\nSince his falling out with Stalin in 1928\u20131929, [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]] had written an endless stream of letters of repentance and admiration to Stalin. However, Stalin knew that Bukharin's repentance was insincere, as in private Bukharin continued to criticize Stalin and seek out other opponents of Stalin (the [[NKVD]] wiretapped Bukharin's telephone). Shortly before their executions in August 1936, [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] had denounced Bukharin as a traitor during their trial. At the December 1936 plenum of the Central Committee, Yezhov accused Bukharin and [[Alexei Rykov]] of treachery. Bukharin confessed to conspiring against Stalin, and was executed on 15 March 1938, on the same day that former NKVD chief, Yagoda, was also executed.\n\nStalin eventually turned on [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]]. He appointed Yezhov Commissar of Water Transport in April 1938 (a similar thing had happened to Yezhov's predecessor, Yagoda, shortly before he was fired). Stalin began ordering the executions of Yezhov's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the [[NKVD]].<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=280}}</ref> [[Soviet Politburo|Politburo]] members also started to openly condemn the excesses of the NKVD under Yezhov's leadership, all of which gave the signal that Yezhov was falling from Stalin's favour.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=369}}</ref> Yezhov eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and resigned as [[NKVD]] chief on 23 November 1938. Yezhov was replaced as NKVD chief by [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

He served as the [[General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 until his [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death]] in 1953. In the years following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], he rose to become dictator of the Soviet Union, using a combination of manipulation and terror to destroy his opposition. \n\nAfter growing up in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Stalin became a political activist, conducting discreet activities for the [[Bolshevik Party]] for twelve years before the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. Following the [[October Revolution]], Stalin took military positions in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. Stalin was one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the [[Caucasus]] and grew close to leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], who saw him as a tough character, and a loyal follower capable of getting things done behind the scenes. Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]], adopting a hardline approach to opposition. Stalin's connections helped him to gain influential positions behind the scenes in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet-Russia]]n government.    \n\nAt the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik Party]]'s 11th Congress, leaders decided to expand the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]. Due to this expansion, a secretariat became a necessity. Stalin was appointed the head of this new office on the 3rd of April 1922. From that date until his death, Stalin's formal title was ''General Secretary''. The office grew with Stalin's aggressive assumption of power, not the other way around. After a brief disappointment of not being given a prestigious ministerial post, Stalin soon learned how to use his new office in order to gain advantages towards other key persons within the Bolshevik Party. He prepared the agenda for the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] meetings, directing the course of meetings. As General Secretary, he appointed new local party leaders, establishing a patronage network of people loyal to him.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''Stalin - a Political Biography'', 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp 184-233</ref>     \n\nOnly a few weeks after his appointment, Lenin was forced into semi-retirement because of a stroke. Lenin never fully recovered and died in January 1924. He spent most of his remaining life resting in a countryside [[Dacha]]. But he received messages and political visitors, and between the autumn of 1922 and spring of 1923, he resumed his party leadership in Moscow. As late as in October 1922, Lenin expressed his \"unreserved support\" for Stalin as General Secretary and for his work with a new constitution. (Adopted in December 1924, it shaped the Soviet Union.) But soon thereafter, and having learned that a number of matters related to brutality, abuse of power and rising internal party struggles had occurred during his absence, Lenin's faith in Stalin faded. Lenin was disturbed by a report on violent atrocities committed in Georgia, reported by the head of the security police [[GPU]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]. He attributed the atrocities to [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]] and associated people. Neither did Lenin approve of Dzerzhinsky, who expressed his support of Stalin, whilst reporting on Georgia to Lenin.<ref>Harrison S.Salisbury,\"Russia in Revolution 1900-1930\", 1978, Swedish {{ISBN|91 29 53057 1}}, p. 264</ref> Further, Stalin had been very unpleasant with Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] on the telephone. Stalin had threatened to have her prosecuted for having disturbed Lenin with political matters during his recovery.<ref>Salisbury, p.266-269 (the book has numerous illustrations.)</ref>\n\nAll of this caused a growing suspicion on Stalin. In December 1922 and early January 1923, Lenin dictated a political will. Historian [[Isaac Deutscher]], who first published reports in 1949 of the terrorism conducted by Stalin, described Lenin's will by the following: \"The whole testament breathed uncertainty\". It contains some hard criticism on Stalin, but sharply criticizes [[Leon Trotsky]]; Lenin primarily expressed a fear of a future fragmentation of the party. <ref>Isaac Deutscher, '''Stalin - a Political Biography'', 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp 198-199</ref>     \n\nAfter [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]], a struggle for power in the party broke out in the open. Stalin, through his office as General Secretary, took advantage of his knowledge of the existing antagonisms among the Bolshevik Party's leaders. Many were members of the Party's supreme organ, the Politburo, but rivalries extended beyond that. Several People's Commissars (or Ministers in other countries) were involved in the Party's internal personal as well as political struggles. [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] represented the intellectual \"[[Left Opposition|left wing]],\" whilst [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Mikhail Tomsky]] and [[Alexei Rykov]] represented the trade unionist \"[[Right Opposition|right wing]]\". But the most prominent Bolshevik after Lenin's death was [[Leon Trotsky]], who led a group of his own. None of these persons would survive Stalin; all died of suspected assassinations.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''Stalin - a Political Biography'', 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, p 203</ref>      \n\nSoon after Lenin's death, Stalin joined Zinoviev and Kamenev in a Politburo Triumvirate. By 1924 they were united in wanting to get rid of the troublesome Trotsky. But this was no easy task. Trotsky had developed the [[Red Army]] and had played a huge role during the [[October Revolution]]. He was intellectually and as orator superior to Stalin. Stalin used Zinoviev and Kamenev to combat Trotsky, while appearing as \"The Golden Centre Man\". There are multiple theories on the hostility between Stalin and Trotsky, and when it began. But a huge ''political'' divider became Stalin's idea of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" vs Trotsky's \"[[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]]\". Stalin's idea, was in the mid-1920s actually revolutionary in itself. The entire Bolshevik concept had been to begin at home, in Russia, and then \"export\" the revolution to the West. By 1925 it had become apparent that all [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolutionary movements in Germany]] and [[Revolutions of 1917-23|elsewhere]] had failed. In Italy even a counter-socialistic movement, [[Fascism]], had come to power. From these perspectives did not that few Bolsheviks suddenly see Stalin's idea as sound when compared to Trotsky's. <ref>Isaac Deutscher, \"Stalin - a Political Biography\", 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp 233-249</ref> Trotsky was first removed as Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs (January 1925), removed from the Politburo (October 1926), removed from the Central Committee (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma\u2013Ata in [[Kazakhstan]] (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). \n\nBut Stalin had canceled the cooperation with Zinoviev and Kamenev a long time before Trotsky's final decline. He slowly but steadily desired to get rid of his two former Triumvirate-companions. During this phase, Stalin instead joined forces with the \"right\" of the Bolshevik Party. Together with Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov, Stalin could now rather easily send Zinoviev and Kamenev to [[Gulag]] (thus far just briefly), and by 1929 also Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov found themselves played by Stalin. All struggles for power were over. Stalin was now the autocratic ruler of the entire Soviet Union. Millions of Russians and people of other ethnic origin inside the Soviet Union had been killed during the [[Russian Civil War]], through starvation and in other conflicts, but the bloodbath had thus far not reached within the Bolshevik Party.\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Early life of Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin in the Russian Revolution, Russian Civil War, and Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n\nBefore his 1913-1917 exile in Siberia, Stalin was one of the Bolshevik operatives in the Caucasus, organizing cells, spreading propaganda, and raising money through criminal activities. Stalin eventually earned a place in Lenin's inner circle and the highest echelons of the Bolshevik hierarchy. His pseudonym, Stalin, means \"man of the steel hand\". The [[October Revolution]] took place in the Russian capital of [[Petrograd]] on 7 November 1917 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 25 October 1917), which saw the transfer of all political power to the Soviets.\n\nIn the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, Stalin forged connections with various Red Army generals and eventually acquired military powers of his own. He brutally suppressed counter-revolutionaries and bandits. After winning the civil war, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with [[Poland]], which was fighting the Red Army in [[Ukraine]]. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine and later in Poland itself, Stalin's [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|actions in the war]] were later criticized by many, including [[Leon Trotsky]].\n\n==Invasion of Georgia and General Secretary==\nIn late 1920, with the crises in society following the [[Russian Civil War]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] argued for the trade unions to be incorporated more and more into the workers' state, and for the workers' state to completely control the industrial sectors. Lenin's position was one where the trade unions were subordinate to the workers' state, but separate, with Lenin accusing Trotsky of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\". Fearing a backlash from the trade unions, Lenin asked Stalin to build a support base in the [[Rabkrin|Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (Rabkrin)]] against bureaucratism.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=186}}</ref> Lenin's faction eventually prevailed at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921. Frustrated by the squabbling factions within the Communist Party during what he saw as a time of crisis, Lenin convinced the Tenth Congress to pass a ban on any opposition to official Central Committee policy (the [[Ban on Factions]], a law which Stalin would later exploit to expel his enemies).<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\">Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-330-41913-0}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\nStalin played a decisive role in engineering the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] in February and March 1921, at a time when Georgia was the biggest [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Menshevik stronghold]]. Following the invasion, Stalin adopted particularly hardline, centralist policies towards [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]], which included severe repression of opposition to the Bolsheviks, and to opposition within the local Communist Party (e.g., the [[Georgian Affair]] of 1922), not to mention any manifestations of [[anti-Soviet]]ism (the [[August Uprising]] of 1924).<ref>Knight, Ami W.

Stalin still held his posts in the [[Orgburo]], the [[Rabkrin|Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate]] and the Commassariat for Nationalities Affairs, though he agreed to delegate his workload to subordinates. With this power, he would steadily place his supporters in positions of authority.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\n==Lenin's retirement and death==\n[[Image:Lenin and stalin crop.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] visiting the ailing [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] at his dacha in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]] in 1922.]]\nOn 25 May 1922, Lenin suffered a stroke while recovering from surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck since a failed assassination attempt in August 1918. Severely debilitated, he went into semi-retirement and moved to his [[dacha]] in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]]. After this, prominent Bolsheviks were concerned about who would take over if Lenin actually died. Lenin and Trotsky had more of a personal and theoretical relationship, while Lenin and Stalin had more of a political and apparatical relationship. Yet, Stalin visited Lenin often, acting as his intermediary with the outside world.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> During this time, the two quarrelled over economic policy and how to consolidate the Soviet republics. One day, Stalin verbally swore at Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], for breaching [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] orders by helping Lenin communicate with [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and others about politics;<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> this greatly offended Lenin. As their relationship deteriorated, Lenin dictated increasingly disparaging notes on Stalin in what would become [[Lenin's Testament|his testament]]. Lenin criticised Stalin's rude manners, excessive power, ambition and politics, and suggested that Stalin should be removed from the position of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]. One of Lenin's secretaries showed Stalin the notes, whose contents shocked him.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> On 9 March 1923, Lenin suffered his most debilitating stroke, which ended his political career.\n\nDuring Lenin's semi-retirement, Stalin forged a [[triumvirate]] alliance with [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] in May 1922, against [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]. These allies prevented [[Lenin's Testament]] from being revealed to the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)|Twelfth Party Congress]] in April 1923.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>  Although Zinoviev and Kamenev were disconcerted by Stalin's power and some of his policies, they needed Stalin's help in opposing Trotsky's faction and to prevent Trotsky's possible succession to Lenin in a power struggle.\n\nLenin died on 21 January 1924. Stalin was given the honour of organizing his funeral. Upon Lenin's death, Stalin was officially hailed as his successor as the leader of the ruling Communist Party and of the Soviet Union itself. Against Lenin's wishes, he was given a lavish funeral and his body was embalmed and put on display.  Thanks to Kamenev and Zinoviev's influence, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] decided that [[Lenin's Testament]] should not be made public. At the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)|Thirteenth Party Congress]] in May 1924, it was read out only to the heads of the provincial delegations. Trotsky did not want to appear divisive so soon after Lenin's death and did not seize the opportunity to demand Stalin's removal.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=223}}</ref>\n\n==Downfall of Trotsky==\n[[File:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u0413\u041f\u0423.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Stalin walks in the streets of Moscow in 1920s]]\nIn the months following Lenin's death, Stalin's disputes with Zinoviev and Kamenev intensified. While the triumvirate remained intact throughout 1924 and the early months of 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev did not regard Stalin highly as a revolutionary theorist, and often disparaged him in private even as they had aided him publicly against Trotsky and the [[Left Opposition]]. For his part, Stalin was cautious about where the political situation was heading, and often felt that Zinoviev's volatile rhetoric against Trotsky was going too far, especially when Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party in January 1925. Stalin opposed Zinoviev's demand, and skillfully played the role of a moderate. At this time, Stalin was allying himself more and more with [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and the [[Right Opposition]], whom Stalin had promoted to the Politburo at the Thirteenth Party Congress. Stalin proposed the theory of [[Socialism in One Country]] in October 1924, which Bukharin soon elaborated upon to give it a theoretical justification. Zinoviev and Kamenev suddenly found themselves in a minority at the Fourteenth Party Conference in April 1925, over their belief that socialism could only be achieved internationally, which resulted in the triumvirate splitting up. This saw a strengthening of Stalin's alliance with Bukharin.\n\nWith Trotsky mostly sidelined with a persistent illness during 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev then formed the [[New Opposition]] against Stalin. At the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|Fourteenth Party Congress]] in December 1925, Stalin openly attacked Kamenev and Zinoviev, revealing that they had asked for his aid in expelling Trotsky from the Communist Party. Stalin's revelation made Zinoviev, in particular, very unpopular with many inside the Communist Party. Trotsky remained silent throughout this Congress.\n\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev and Kamenev drew closer to Trotsky and the Left Opposition, forming an alliance which became known as the [[United Opposition]]. The United Opposition demanded, among other things, greater freedom of expression within the Communist Party and less bureaucracy. In October 1926, Stalin's supporters voted Trotsky out of the Politburo. \n\nDuring the years of 1926 and 1927, Soviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.</ref> resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.<ref>Compilation Group for the \"History of Modern China Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" \u2014 the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, \"The Prospects of Revolution in China\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\" contained in ''J.

However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the [[Shanghai massacre|Shanghai massacre of April 1927]] by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/moscowchinesecom00nort|url-access=registration|quote=trotsky squeezed lemon chiang.|title=Moscow and Chinese Communists|author=Robert Carver North|year=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|edition=2|isbn=0-8047-0453-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/moscowchinesecom00nort/page/96 96]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMwdWFtgV0QC&pg=PA282&dq=trotsky+squeezed+lemon+chiang&hl=en&ei=d9YjTfu3C4GdlgfNiNHkCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=trotsky%20squeezed%20lemon%20chiang&f=false|title=A history of Russia: Since 1855|author=Walter Moss|year=2005|publisher=Anthem Press|edition=2, illustrated|volume=Volume 2 of A History of Russia|isbn=1-84331-034-1|page=282|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile the catastrophic events in China completely vindicated Trotsky's criticism of Stalin's approach towards the Chinese Revolution, this paled in significance compared to the demoralization that the Soviet masses felt at such a big setback for socialist revolution in China, with this demoralization aiding Stalin and his allies in the Communist Party and the Soviet state. Attacks against the United Opposition increased in volatility and ferocity. Many supporters of Kamenev and Zinoviev's group, as well as most from the Workers Opposition grouping, had left the United Opposition by mid-1927, changing sides under the growing political pressure and espousing their support for Stalin. Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev grew increasingly isolated and were ejected from the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] in October 1927.\n\nOn 7 November 1927, on the tenth anniversary of the [[October Revolution]], the United Opposition held a demonstration in Red Square, Moscow, along with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s widow, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. On 12 November 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party itself, followed by Kamenev at the Fifteenth Party Congress in December 1927.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> At the Congress, where Kamenev acted as the United Opposition's spokesman due to Trotsky's and Zinoviev's expulsion, the United Opposition were unable to gain the support of more than a small minority of the Communist Party, and they were expelled after the Congress declared United Opposition views to be incompatible with Communist Party membership.\n\nWhile Trotsky remained firm in his opposition to Stalin after his expulsion from the Communist Party and his subsequent exile, Zinoviev and Kamenev capitulated almost immediately, and called on their supporters to follow suit. They wrote open letters acknowledging their mistakes and were readmitted to the Communist Party in June 1928, after a six-month cooling-off period. They never regained their Central Committee seats, but they were given mid-level positions within the Soviet bureaucracy. Kamenev and Zinoviev were courted by Bukharin at the beginning of his short and ill-fated struggle with Stalin in the summer of 1928. This activity was soon reported to Stalin and was later used against Bukharin as proof of his factionalism. Trotsky, firmer than ever in his opposition to Stalin, was exiled to [[Alma-ata]] in January 1928, and was exiled from the Soviet Union itself in February 1929, sent into exile in Turkey. From his exile, Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin, right up until Trotsky was assassinated on Stalin's orders in August 1940.\n\n==Stalin turns on the Right==\n{{also|Stalin's cult of personality}}\n[[File:\u0412 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c 50-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0426\u041a \u0412\u041a\u041f(\u0431) \u0418. \u0412. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430.jpg|thumb|200px| Stalin birthday in 1929.

In January 1928, Stalin personally travelled to Siberia where he oversaw the seizure of grain stockpiles from [[kulak]] farmers. Many in the Communist Party supported the seizures, but [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]] and Premier [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] were outraged.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/><ref name=\"RedTsar\">Simon Sebag Montefiore.

By the latter months of 1928, a critical shortfall in grain supplies prompted Stalin to push for [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation of agriculture]]. Stalin began pushing for more rapid [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation and central control of the economy]], a position which alienated Bukharin and the Right Opposition, but which appeared close to what the Left Opposition had advocated before they were banned.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=258|loc= ch. 23}}</ref> <ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=260|loc= ch. 23}}</ref> Stalin accused Bukharin of factionalism and capitalist tendencies. The other [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] members sided with Stalin, and labelled Bukharin a \"Right Deviationist\" from Marxist\u2013Leninist principles.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=265}}</ref> Bukharin was ejected from the Politburo in November 1929. \n\nStalin's agricultural policies were also criticized by fellow Politburo member [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. In the summer of 1930, Stalin exposed Kalinin's embezzlement of state funds, which he spent on a mistress. Kalinin begged forgiveness and effectively submitted himself to Stalin.<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=60}}</ref>  In September 1930, Stalin proposed dismissing [[Prime Minister of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]], who was Bukharin's fellow oppositionist. The other Politburo members agreed with Stalin, and supported his nomination of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. On December 19, the Central Committee dismissed Rykov and replaced him with Molotov.<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=64}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1930, open criticism of Stalin within the Communist Party was virtually non-existent, though Stalin continued to hunt for discreet dissenters.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=284}}</ref> Stalin dominated the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] (the policy-making branch of the Communist Party) through staunch allies such as [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], and [[Kliment Voroshilov]].\n\n==Death of his wife==\n\nOn the night of 9 November 1932, Stalin's wife, [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]], committed suicide and shot herself in her bedroom. As Stalin was sleeping in another room,<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=292}}</ref> her death was not discovered until the next morning. To prevent a scandal, ''[[Pravda]]'' reported the cause of death as [[appendicitis]].  Stalin did not tell his own children the truth, in order to prevent them from revealing it accidentally.\n\n==The Great Terror==\n{{main|Great Purge}}\n{{Stalinism sidebar}}\nOn 1 December 1934, [Sergei Kirov] was murdered by [Leonid Nikolaev]. The death of this popular, high-profile politician shocked Russia, and Stalin used this murder to begin [[The Great Purge|The Great Terror]]. Within hours of Kirov's death, Stalin declared [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and his supporters to be responsible for Kirov's murder.<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=160}}</ref>  [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] were arrested and, to escape long prison sentences, confessed to political and moral responsibility for Kirov's murder. In January 1935, Zinoviev was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, and Kamenev was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. Stalin sanctioned the formation of [[NKVD troika|troikas]] for the purpose of extrajudicial punishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=315}}</ref> In April 1935, Kamenev's prison sentence was increased by another 5 years, to a total of 10 years imprisonment. Hundreds of oppositionists linked to Kamenev and Zinoviev were arrested and exiled to Siberia.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=316}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=167}}</ref>  In late 1935, Stalin reopened the case. Kamenev and Zinoviev were interrogated again, and the exiled [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] was now accused of being the leading mastermind in Kirov's murder.<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=188}}</ref> As in claimed by Montefiore, in July 1936, Stalin promised Kamenev and Zinoviev (through NKVD chief, [[Genrikh Yagoda]]) that there would be no executions or persecution of their families if they confessed to conspiring with Trotsky.<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=193}}</ref> Stalin's promise was soon broken. A few weeks later, after a trial, [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] were both executed on 25 August 1936.\n\nSpearheading Stalin's purges was a Commissar called [[Nikolai Yezhov]], a fervent Stalinist and a believer in violent repression.<ref name=\"famouspictures\">{{cite web |date=2012-09-03|url = http://www.famouspictures.org/altered-images/#TrotskyWhatTrotskyF|title = Famous Pictures Magazine - Altered Images|publisher = Famous Picture| accessdate = 2012-10-13 | last= Lucas, Dean|quote=}}</ref> [[Nikolai Yezhov]] continued to expand the lists of suspects to include all the old oppositionists as well as entire nationalities, such as the [[Poles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=204}}</ref>\n\nStalin distrusted the Soviet secret police - the [[NKVD]] - which was filled with Old Bolsheviks and ethnicities he distrusted, such as [[Poles]], [[Jews]] and [[Latvian people|Latvians]].<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=205}}</ref> In September 1936, Stalin fired the head of the [[NKVD]], [[Genrikh Yagoda]], and replaced him with the more aggressive and zealous [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]], with Yezhov overseeing the most brutally oppressive period of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] from late 1936 to late 1938.\n\nIn June 1937, [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|The Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization]] took place. Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and the senior [[Red Army]] military officers [[Iona Yakir]], [[Ieronim Uborevich]], [[Robert Eideman]], [[August Kork]], [[Vitovt Putna]], [[Boris Feldman]] and [[Vitaly Primakov]] (as well as [[Yakov Gamarnik]], who committed suicide before the investigations began) were accused of [[anti-Soviet]] conspiracy and sentenced to death; they were executed on the night of 11 to 12 June 1937, immediately after the verdict delivered by a Special Session (\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435) of the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]]. The Tribunal was presided over by [[Vasili Ulrikh]] and included marshals [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Semyon Budyonny]] and Army Commanders [[Yakov Alksnis]], [[Boris Shaposhnikov]], [[Ivan Panfilovich Belov]], [[Pavel Dybenko]], and [[Nikolai Kashirin]]. Only Ulrikh, Budyonny and Shaposhnikov would survive the [[purge]]s that followed. The [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky|Tukhachevsky]] trial triggered a massive subsequent purge of the [[Red Army]]. In September 1938, the People's Commissar for Defence, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], reported that a total of 37,761 officers and [[commissar]]s were dismissed from the army, 10,868 were arrested and 7,211 were condemned for anti-Soviet crimes.\n\nSince his falling out with Stalin in 1928\u20131929, [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]] had written an endless stream of letters of repentance and admiration to Stalin. However, Stalin knew that Bukharin's repentance was insincere, as in private Bukharin continued to criticize Stalin and seek out other opponents of Stalin (the [[NKVD]] wiretapped Bukharin's telephone). Shortly before their executions in August 1936, [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] had denounced Bukharin as a traitor during their trial. At the December 1936 plenum of the Central Committee, Yezhov accused Bukharin and [[Alexei Rykov]] of treachery. Bukharin confessed to conspiring against Stalin, and was executed on 15 March 1938, on the same day that former NKVD chief, Yagoda, was also executed.\n\nStalin eventually turned on [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]]. He appointed Yezhov Commissar of Water Transport in April 1938 (a similar thing had happened to Yezhov's predecessor, Yagoda, shortly before he was fired). Stalin began ordering the executions of Yezhov's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the [[NKVD]].<ref>{{harvnb|Montefiore|2003|p=280}}</ref> [[Soviet Politburo|Politburo]] members also started to openly condemn the excesses of the NKVD under Yezhov's leadership, all of which gave the signal that Yezhov was falling from Stalin's favour.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=369}}</ref> Yezhov eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and resigned as [[NKVD]] chief on 23 November 1938. Yezhov was replaced as NKVD chief by [[Lavrentiy Beria]]. Yezhov was executed on 4 February 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2004|p=368}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{See also|Bibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kotkin |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Kotkin |title=Stalin.
