He then attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1989 to 1997, where he earned a PhD in Intelligent Systems. In 1997, he joined [[Carnegie Mellon University]] as a postdoctoral fellow. Since then, he has been conducting research, specializing in [[artificial intelligence]], intelligent educational systems, cognitive modeling, learning and metacognitive skills, and case-based reasoning. He now serves as a professor and director of the undergraduate program at Carnegie Mellon University's [[Human-Computer Interaction Institute|Human\u2013Computer Interaction Institute]].\n\n== Research == \n'''Cognitive Tutor'''\n\nAleven, along with his colleague Kenneth Koedinger, assisted in creating Cognitive Tutor, an intelligent tutoring software that supports guided tutoring for math courses. His research investigated whether self-explanation through Cognitive Tutor could improve student performance in school more than conventional methods. Aleven and his fellow researchers found that students who explained their problems on practice problems with Cognitive Tutor regularly performed significantly better than those who did not use the software. These results highlight the benefits of self-explanation and learning software that can scale for classroom use to assist all students.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aleven|first=Vincent A.W.M.M.|last2=Koedinger|first2=Kenneth R.|date=March 2002|title=An effective metacognitive strategy: learning by doing and explaining with a computer-based Cognitive Tutor|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=26|issue=2|pages=147\u2013179|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2602_1}}</ref>\n\n'''Enhancing MOOCs with ITS'''\n\nAleven, along with his colleagues Jonathan Sewall, Ryan Baker, Yuan Wang, and Octav Popescu introduced intelligent tutoring systems(ITS) into massive open online courses (MOOCs) to enhance learning-by-doing and overall student performance. The ITSs support learning-by-doing to assist students by guiding them through complex practice problems and having them explain their work. The researchers also embedded their Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools(CTAT), a toolkit to create intelligent computer tutors, into MOOCs. Their research demonstrated the technical feasibility of embedding CTAT or similar ITSs into MOOCs.
