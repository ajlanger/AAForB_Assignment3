The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a [[clade]]; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to bees and ants.\n\nThe most commonly known wasps, such as [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, are in the family [[Vespidae]] and are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual [[haplodiploid]] system of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]] in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an [[ovipositor]] for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the [[Aculeata]] the ovipositor is often modified instead into a [[Sting (biology)|sting]] used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many [[ecology|ecological roles]]. Some are [[predator]]s or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the [[cuckoo wasp]]s, are [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are [[parasitoid wasp|parasitoidal]], meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often [[mass provisioning|provision their own nests]] with such [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every [[pest insect]], making wasps valuable in [[horticulture]] for [[biological pest control]] of species such as [[whitefly]] in [[tomato]]es and other crops.\n\nWasps first appeared in the fossil record in the [[Jurassic]], and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the [[Cretaceous]]. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the [[Asian giant hornet]], at up to {{convert|5|cm}} in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as [[tarantula hawk]]s, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (''[[Megascolia procer]]''). The smallest wasps are solitary [[chalcid wasp]]s in the family [[Mymaridae]], including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only {{convert|0.139|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the smallest known flying insect, only {{convert|0.15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nWasps have appeared in literature from [[Classical era|Classical times]], as the eponymous chorus of old men in [[Aristophanes]]' 422 BC comedy {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|Sph\u0113kes}}), ''[[The Wasps]]'', and in [[science fiction]] from [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1904 novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'', featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings. The name \"Wasp\"<!--intentionally Upper Case--> has been used for many warships and other military equipment.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n[[File:Wasps are Paraphyletic.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wasps are [[paraphyletic]], consisting of the [[clade]] [[Apocrita]] without [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s, which are not usually considered to be wasps.

With their powerful stings and conspicuous [[warning coloration]], often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., [[resin]]), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with [[saliva]]. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as ''[[Median wasp|Dolichovespula media]]'' and ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris|D. sylvestris]]'' prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; ''[[Protopolybia exigua]] ''attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; ''[[Polistes erythrocephalus]]'' chooses sites close to a water source.<ref name= bdigital>{{cite journal | author=Carlos A.

The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a [[clade]]; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to bees and ants.\n\nThe most commonly known wasps, such as [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, are in the family [[Vespidae]] and are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual [[haplodiploid]] system of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]] in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an [[ovipositor]] for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the [[Aculeata]] the ovipositor is often modified instead into a [[Sting (biology)|sting]] used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many [[ecology|ecological roles]]. Some are [[predator]]s or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the [[cuckoo wasp]]s, are [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are [[parasitoid wasp|parasitoidal]], meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often [[mass provisioning|provision their own nests]] with such [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every [[pest insect]], making wasps valuable in [[horticulture]] for [[biological pest control]] of species such as [[whitefly]] in [[tomato]]es and other crops.\n\nWasps first appeared in the fossil record in the [[Jurassic]], and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the [[Cretaceous]]. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the [[Asian giant hornet]], at up to {{convert|5|cm}} in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as [[tarantula hawk]]s, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (''[[Megascolia procer]]''). The smallest wasps are solitary [[chalcid wasp]]s in the family [[Mymaridae]], including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only {{convert|0.139|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the smallest known flying insect, only {{convert|0.15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nWasps have appeared in literature from [[Classical era|Classical times]], as the eponymous chorus of old men in [[Aristophanes]]' 422 BC comedy {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|Sph\u0113kes}}), ''[[The Wasps]]'', and in [[science fiction]] from [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1904 novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'', featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings. The name \"Wasp\"<!--intentionally Upper Case--> has been used for many warships and other military equipment.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n[[File:Wasps are Paraphyletic.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wasps are [[paraphyletic]], consisting of the [[clade]] [[Apocrita]] without [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s, which are not usually considered to be wasps.

With their powerful stings and conspicuous [[warning coloration]], often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., [[resin]]), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with [[saliva]]. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as ''[[Median wasp|Dolichovespula media]]'' and ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris|D. sylvestris]]'' prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; ''[[Protopolybia exigua]] ''attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; ''[[Polistes erythrocephalus]]'' chooses sites close to a water source.<ref name= bdigital>{{cite journal | author=Carlos A.

Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey.
