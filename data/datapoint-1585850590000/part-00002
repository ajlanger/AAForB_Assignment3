''The New York Times'', October 19, 1997.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church in [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] is murdered after being paged to meet someone outside.\n\nAt a missile base in [[Russia]], [[R-36 (missile)#R-36M (SS-18) variants|SS-18]] [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] are being decommissioned. Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, Russian General Aleksandr Kodoroff, along with a rogue [[Spetznaz]] unit, kills the soldiers on board the transport train and transfers nine of the warheads to another train. Kodoroff then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and sends the transport on a collision course with a passenger train. Minutes later, the 500-kiloton warhead detonates, killing the survivors and delaying an investigation.\n\nThe detonation immediately attracts the attention of the U.S. government. White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly believes that [[Chechens|Chechen]] terrorists are behind the incident. [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that the crash and detonation were staged to hide the hijacking of the other warheads. A call to Devoe's long-time friend and Russian counterpart, Dimitri Vertikoff, adds credence to his hypothesis and he is assigned as Dr. Kelly's military liaison.\n\nKelly and Devoe try to track the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia. When the Mafia realizes they are U.S. government agents, they send thugs to kill them. Vertikoff, attempting to pay them off, is killed. Devoe kills most of the would-be assassins, and he and Kelly escape. Information from the trucking company shows that the nukes are going to [[Iran]]. Spy satellites place the truck in a traffic jam in [[Dagestan]], and Devoe uses a ruse to identify it. The satellite, tracking in real time, is able to verify its license plate.\n\nStopped at a checkpoint, Kodoroff and his men kill the guards. Devoe then leads a U.S. special operations unit to stop them. Denied entry into Russian airspace, one of the helicopters is shot down by a Russian [[surface-to-air missile]] battery, but the remaining helicopters are able to locate the truck carrying the warheads. A gunfight ensues in which Kodoroff is killed and the warheads are seized. Interrogation of the surviving member of the group reveals that one warhead was taken by another man who was able to escape before the truck was intercepted.\n\nFurther work on the information from the trucking company leads [[Implementation Force|IFOR]] to a [[Sarajevo]] address. Inside is a video cassette of a Yugoslav named Du\u0161an Gavri\u0107. Gavri\u0107 disclaims any allegiance in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (\"I am a Serb, a Croat, and a Muslim\"), but blames other countries for supplying weapons to all sides in the war. Dr. Kelly realizes he intends to bomb a meeting at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City and the city goes into lockdown. Gavri\u0107 arrives in Manhattan with the Bosnian diplomatic delegation. A flashback shows that Gavri\u0107 wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter, who were killed in Sarajevo. He and his brother are finally found by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. When his brother is killed by Devoe, a wounded Gavri\u0107 is followed into a parochial school and then a church. Devoe confronts Gavri\u0107, who commits suicide, knowing that the bomb is set to go off in a matter of minutes and cannot be deactivated. With only seconds to spare, Dr. Kelly is able to remove a part of the [[explosive lens]] shell of the bomb, stopping the primary explosion from establishing [[critical mass]] within the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|plutonium core]]. The primary wrecks the church, but the warhead itself does not detonate. Devoe and Kelly both survive with minor injuries. After the nuclear attack is over, Julia spends her free time swimming and Devoe stops by and ask her for a drink, which she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Lt. Col.
