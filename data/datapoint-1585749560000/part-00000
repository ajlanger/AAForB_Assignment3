{"title_page": "S\u00f6derledstunneln", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}}\n\nThe '''S\u00f6derledstunneln''' (\"South Way Tunnel\")  is a tunnel between the [[Centralbron|Central Bridge]] and the [[Johanneshovsbron|Johanneshov Bridge]] on the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] in [[Stockholm]]. It is 1,550 metres long and traverses the island from north to south.\n\nBuilding started on 9 October 1984. On the stretch between [[Br\u00e4nnkyrkagatan]] and [[Folkungagatan, Stockholm|Folkungagatan]] an earlier tunnel called [[S\u00f6dergatan]] had been built in 1944 in a cut-and-cover trench. Between 1964\u20131966, it was extended 150 metres under \u00c5s\u00f6 High School.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s, the decision was taken to build a tunnel to alleviate the congestion south of [[H\u00f6gbergsgatan]], and then to rebuild the existing northern tunnel. Work finished on schedule in January 1991.\n\nThe tunnel is actually two tubes of 7.25 metres wide apiece, with each carrying two lanes of traffic. The height is 4.5 metres, with 110 metres of the length cut out of the rock and the rest being concrete lined.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180px heights=130px>\nFile:S\u00f6dergatan 1968a.jpg|Before being covered-over, 1968\nFile:Soderledstunneln 1985.jpg|During construction work, 1985\nFile:Soderledstunneln 2008.jpg|Entrance from the north, 2008\nFile:S\u00f6derledstunneln 2012.jpg|South-going tube, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n{{Coord|59|19|13.58|N|18|04|06.04|E|region:SE_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Soderledstunneln}}\n[[Category:1984 establishments in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Road tunnels in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Transport in Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Tunnels completed in 1991]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}}\n\nThe '''S\u00f6derledstunneln''' (\"South Way Tunnel\")  is a tunnel between the [[Centralbron|Central Bridge]] and the [[Johanneshovsbron|Johanneshov Bridge]] on the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] in [[Stockholm]].
