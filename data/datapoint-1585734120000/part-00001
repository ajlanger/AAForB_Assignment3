The second volume had not been ready in time to be presented to Riddell. Burns wrote in 1794 to Robert Riddell's unmarried sister Eleanor, asking that she and her married sister Elizabeth would either return or destroy the manuscripts, saying that \"''I made a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written. They are many of them local, some puerile and silly, and all of them unfit for the public eye. As I have some little fame at stake ... I am uneasy now for the fate of those manuscripts. ...

After Currie's death they passed into the possession of his son William Wallace Currie. In 1853 when William died his widow, without permission, offered them to a private gentlemen's club known as the [[Liverpool Athenaeum]]<ref name=\"Pd\"/> where they resided, forgotten in a box for circa twenty years, until in 1873 Mr. Henry A.

Burns started work on the first volume in May of that year. \n\nBurns wrote in the manuscript that \"''...If my Poems which I have transcribed into your book were equal to the grateful respect and high esteem I bear for the Gentleman to whom I present them, they would be the finest Poems in any language.''\"<ref name=\"JMK\"/>\n\nThe first volume contained several significant unpublished examples of Burns's work such as the \"''Lament for James, Earl of Glencairn''\"; \"''Epistle to John Goldie''\"; \"''Elegy on the Death of [[Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet|Sir James Hunter Blair]]''\"; \"''Tam o'Shanter''\" and \"''Holy Willie's Prayer''\".<ref name=\"Pd\"/>\n\nBurns also added the lines \"Let these be regarded as the genuine sentiments of a man who seldom flattered any, and never those he loved.\"<ref name=\"Pd\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=Maurice Lindsay's The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=978-0-7090-9194-3|page=145}}</ref>\n\nThe pages have been numbered with the number placed in the centre of the top of the page and bracketed on the amanuenis's work and unbracketed on the top right or left of the page on those with Burns's writing, but not always on the fore-edge side.

I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''.

[[Alexander Nasmyth]] was a landscape painter and was a reluctant portrait painter, however he met with Burns and they became friends, resulting in Nasmyth producing a portrait which he never fully completed due to his concern over spoiling what he had already achieved.

Burns added various footnotes throughout the work, such as the detailed notes where he disowns the spelling, punctuation, incorrect titles, etc. in the Dr Moore letter.<ref name=\"EGa\">{{Cite book|last=Burns|first=Robert|year=1914|title=The Glenriddell Manuscripts of Robert Burns|publisher=John Gribbel|isbn=|page=48}}</ref>Burns mentions that the amanuensis was a clergyman whilst chiding him for the errors he had made.<ref name=\"EGa\"/> A few notes such as \"''Printed II 247''\" on the \"''The Whistle - A Ballad''\" have been added in another hand.\n\nThree different hands are evident in the volumes and it has been noted that [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] the writer had visited Burns at [[Ellisland Farm]] in the autumn of 1789 whilst a divinity student. Burns started work on the first volume in May of that year. \n\nBurns wrote in the manuscript that \"''...If my Poems which I have transcribed into your book were equal to the grateful respect and high esteem I bear for the Gentleman to whom I present them, they would be the finest Poems in any language.''\"<ref name=\"JMK\"/>\n\nThe first volume contained several significant unpublished examples of Burns's work such as the \"''Lament for James, Earl of Glencairn''\"; \"''Epistle to John Goldie''\"; \"''Elegy on the Death of [[Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet|Sir James Hunter Blair]]''\"; \"''Tam o'Shanter''\" and \"''Holy Willie's Prayer''\".<ref name=\"Pd\"/>\n\nBurns also added the lines \"Let these be regarded as the genuine sentiments of a man who seldom flattered any, and never those he loved.\"<ref name=\"Pd\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=Maurice Lindsay's The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=978-0-7090-9194-3|page=145}}</ref>\n\nThe pages have been numbered with the number placed in the centre of the top of the page and bracketed on the amanuenis's work and unbracketed on the top right or left of the page on those with Burns's writing, but not always on the fore-edge side.

I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''. At the end of the abridgement he wrote ''This is all that, & perhaps more than, is worth quoting, in my M.S.S.''<ref name=\"ED\"/> \n\n===Burns's portrait===\n[[John Beugo]]'s portrait of Burns is included in both volumes of the work, known as such because he engraved the copper plate required for the printing process. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] was a landscape painter and was a reluctant portrait painter, however he met with Burns and they became friends, resulting in Nasmyth producing a portrait which he never fully completed due to his concern over spoiling what he had already achieved. [[John Beugo]] the engraver arranged several sittings with Burns and produced a better likeness as confirmed by [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]]. Nasmyth refused payment from [[William Creech]] and gave the painting to [[Jean Armour]].<ref name=\"JMB\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.
