The departure of a trusted staff member with access to sensitive information can become a data breach if the staff member retains access to the data after termination of the trust relationship.  In distributed systems, this can also occur with a breakdown in a [[web of trust]]. [[Data quality]] is one way of reducing the risk of a data breach,<ref>[http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/expert-comments/nhs-must-prioritise-quality-prevent-data-breaches/ The NHS Must Prioritise Quality To Prevent Further Data Breaches]</ref> partly because it allows the owner of the data to rate data according to importance and give better protection to more important data.\n\nMost such incidents publicized in the media involve [[Privacy|private]] information on individuals, e.g. [[social security number]]s. Loss of corporate information such as [[trade secret]]s, sensitive corporate information, and details of [[contract]]s, or of government information is frequently unreported, as there is no compelling reason to do so in the absence of potential damage to private citizens, and the publicity around such an event may be more damaging than the loss of the data itself.\n\n==Insider versus external threats==\nThose working inside an organization are a major cause of data breaches.

The newspaper published unredacted scans which showed details of the claims, many of which appeared to be in breach of the rules and suggested widespread abuse of the generous expenses system.

The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] continues to investigate possible frauds, and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] is considering further prosecutions.

The departure of a trusted staff member with access to sensitive information can become a data breach if the staff member retains access to the data after termination of the trust relationship.  In distributed systems, this can also occur with a breakdown in a [[web of trust]].

Loss of corporate information such as [[trade secret]]s, sensitive corporate information, and details of [[contract]]s, or of government information is frequently unreported, as there is no compelling reason to do so in the absence of potential damage to private citizens, and the publicity around such an event may be more damaging than the loss of the data itself.\n\n==Insider versus external threats==\nThose working inside an organization are a major cause of data breaches.

A hard disk containing scanned receipts of UK Members of Parliament and Peers in the House of Lords was offered to various UK newspapers in late April, with ''The Daily Telegraph'' finally acquiring it.  They published details in instalments from 8 May onwards.  Although it was intended by Parliament that the data was to be published, this was to be in redacted form, with details the individual members considered \"sensitive\" blanked out.  The newspaper published unredacted scans which showed details of the claims, many of which appeared to be in breach of the rules and suggested widespread abuse of the generous expenses system.  The resulting media storm led to the resignation of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and the prosecution and imprisonment of several MPs and Lords for fraud.  The expenses system was overhauled and tightened up, being put more on a par with private industry schemes.  The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] continues to investigate possible frauds, and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] is considering further prosecutions.  Several MPs and Lords apologised and made whole, partial or no restitution, and retained their seats.  Others who had been shamed in the media did not offer themselves for re-election at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]].
