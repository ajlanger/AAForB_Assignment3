They are best known for their various \"Roland\" designs, notably the [[Roland C.II]] ''Walfisch'' (whale), [[Roland D.II]] ''haifisch'' (Shark) and [[Roland D.VI]], although they also produced a big amount of [[airships]] and many experimental designs.\n\n==Airships==\n[[File:Parseval PL 18 1913-05-03.jpg|thumb|The PL 18 next to an [[airship hangar]].

Additional funding for the new enterprise was provided primarily by [[Krupp]], [[AEG]], and a local chemical company. The company's offices were located in [[Berlin]] along with the factory at [[Adlershof]].  Manufacture was transferred to [[Charlottenburg]] following a fire on 6 September 1916, allegedly caused by the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]].<ref>German Aircraft of the First World War, Gray P. & Thetford O., 1970 Putnam</ref>\n\nTheir first project was an airship design by [[August von Parseval]], a German airship designer. This entered service as the PL.II in 1910. During [[World War I]], four were delivered to the German Army and Navy. In total some 25 \"PL\" airships were built, flown and delivered to various customers. The PL-26, one of the last, crashed on landing and burnt inside hangar ''Luftschiffhalle 2'' with no fatalities. For the rest of the war the [[hangar]]s were used mostly for repairs of [[observation balloon]]s.\n\n==Aeroplanes==\n[[File:LFG Roland C.II LRQ.jpg|thumb|LFG Roland C.II ''Walfisch'']]\nIn 1913 LFG started producing new designs under the [[trade name]] '''Roland''' to avoid confusion with the [[LVG|Luftverkehrsgesellschaft (L.V.G.)]] firm. In 1916 the company developed a [[floatplane]] version of the [[Albatros C.I]]a as the LFG W. Some parts were built in [[Bitterfeld]], but final assembly and checkout was carried out in new factories in [[Stralsund]].\n\nTheir first successful design was the [[LFG Roland C.II|Roland C.II]] ''Walfisch'' (whale), a two-seat [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]] [[biplane]]. It had a [[semi-monocoque]] fuselage, skinned with two layers of long [[plywood]] strips glued at opposing diagonal angles around a mold and skinned with fabric both inside and outside. The fuselage filled the full gap between the wings, leaving the pilot and observer/gunner over the top wings with an excellent view upward. The fuselage \"half-shells\" were each fitted onto a supporting framework of wooden [[former]]s and [[longeron]]s. The \"wrapping\" technique of the long plywood strips for the outer fuselage surface led to this particular technique of manufacture being described in German as the ''Wickelrumpf'' (wrapped body) style of construction, and was subsequently patented by the firm,<ref>{{cite book |title=German Combat Planes: A Comprehensive Survey and History of the Development of German Military Aircraft from 1914 to 1945 |author1=Wagner, Ray  |author2=Nowarra, Heinz  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1971 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |pages=75 & 76 }}</ref> licensing the construction method to [[Pfalz Flugzeugwerke|Pfalz]] in 1917 for construction of their own single-seat fighter designs.  Although it was said to have tricky handling, the Roland C.II had excellent performance, and was also used on long-range missions as a bomber escort. A version with the 200&nbsp;hp [[Benz Bz.IV]] engine and new wing struts was built as the D.III, but only one prototype was ever built, as was the case for the 160&nbsp;hp [[Mercedes D.III]]-powered C.V.\n\nThe C.II was adapted to the pure [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] role as the [[Roland D.I]], but in this role the poor forward view proved to be a problem. A fire at the factory severely constrained production, and only 20 were built. A newer version with a more conventional layout, the [[LFG Roland D.II|Roland D.II]], followed, whose fuselage was reduced in height to leave a gap with the upper wing but was otherwise similar overall. The competing [[Albatros D.I]] was preferred, and only about 230 examples were built, which were then mostly used on the eastern front and in Macedonia. The fuselage to wing gap was further increased in the D.III, but the temperamental  180&nbsp;hp [[Argus As.III]] limited production to only a handful. Six D.IIs were delivered in July 1917 to the Bulgarian Air Force, and six D.IIIs were delivered in May 1918.<ref>Aviation in Bulgaria in the Wars from 1912 to 1945, Vol I, Milano Y., 1995 Sveti Gueorgui Pobedonosetz, Sofia</ref>\n[[File:LFG V 44.JPG|thumb|right|An [[LFG V 44]]]]\nAlthough the ''Wickelrumpf'' style of wood-structure monocoque fuselage was extremely strong, it was also very difficult and time-consuming to build. A new method of construction was introduced that used spruce planking running the length of the aircraft in place of the formed plywood, and the D.III was adapted using this technique to produce [[LFG Roland D.IV|D.IV]] [[triplane]] and D.V biplane, both powered by the D.III's 160&nbsp;hp Mercedes. The fuselage shell's construction technique for these aircraft resembled a [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-planked]] boat hull in appearance when finished, and was named ''Klinkerrumpf'' (clinker body) construction, and was also patented by the firm.<ref>{{cite book |title=German Combat Planes: A Comprehensive Survey and History of the Development of German Military Aircraft from 1914 to 1945 |author1=Wagner, Ray  |author2=Nowarra, Heinz  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1971 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York  |page=90 }}</ref>  A further adaptation of the D.IV with the 185&nbsp;hp Benz Bz. III resulted in the [[Roland D.VI]], which was entered in the First Fighter Competition trials at [[Adlershof]] in early 1918. Although the [[Fokker D.VII]] won that contest, the D.VI was also ordered into production as it used a different engine, and by the end of the war about 350 had been delivered. A large number of different versions using various engines were built as prototypes without entering production, as well as a [[triplane]] adaptation as the D.VI (also known as the Dr.I).\n\nThe next major design from Roland were [[Monoplane#Parasol wing|parasol monoplane]] designs, the D.XVI with the [[Siemens-Halske Sh.III]] or 170&nbsp;hp [[Goebel Goe.III]]a [[Rotary engine|rotary piston engine]]s, and the otherwise similar D.XVII with the inline 185&nbsp;hp [[BMW III]]a. Both were entered into the Second Fighter Competition at Adlershof, but lost to the [[Fokker D.VIII]].\n\nAfter the war all aircraft production in Germany was banned, and the company was forced to close the Bitterfeld plant and reopen in [[Luftschiffhafen Seddin|Seddin]], producing airplanes, balloons and life boats. In 1933, aircraft production shut down. Three additional Parseval pattern airships were also built during this period.\n\n=== Aeroplane types ===\n[[File:1914-1915 Roland.JPG|right|thumb|An [[LFG Roland Pfeilflieger]] observation biplane]]\nThis is a list of aeroplane produced, taken from Nowarra, Heinz: Flugzeuge 1914\u20131918, M\u00fcnchen 1959 and Emmanuel Gustin's list of German military aircraft.<ref>[http://users.telenet.be/Emmanuel.Gustin/faq/ger_mil.txt ], [http://users.skynet.be/Emmanuel.Gustin/ Emmanuel Gustin], 1997-07-04</ref>\n\n* [[LFG Roland C.II|C.II und C.IIa]] \"Walfisch\" biplane [[reconnaissance]], two-seater\n* [[LFG Roland C.III|C.III]] variant of C.II, one built \u2013 destroyed by fire when LFG plant burned, 6 September 1916<ref name=\"Abbott\">Abbott, Dan S., and Grosz, Peter M. \"''The Benighted Rolands''\", Air Enthusiast Quarterly, Bromley, Kent., U.K., Volume 3, 1976, pages 39\u201340.</ref>\n* [[LFG Roland C.V]]- two-seat version of D.II, prototype only\n* C.VIII \u2013 prototype only\n* C.X \u2013 reconnaissance\n* [[Roland D.I|D.I]] \"Haifisch\" \u2013 biplane fighter with top wing mounted on fuselage\n* [[LFG Roland D.II|D.II]] \u2013 fighter, about 230 built\n* [[LFG Roland D.III|D.III]] \u2013 fighter, few built\n* [[LFG Roland D.IV|D.IV]] \u2013 [[triplane]], prototype only (also known as Dr. I)\n* [[LFG Roland D.V|D.V]] \u2013 D.III variant, only three prototypes\n* [[Roland D.VI|D.VI]] \u2013 fighter, 350 built, similar to D.III, ordered as backup for D.VII\n* [[LFG Roland D.VII|D.VII]] \u2013 one prototype built\n* [[LFG Roland D.VIII|D.VIII]] \u2013 one prototype built\n* [[LFG Roland D.IX|D.IX]] \u2013 three prototypes built\n* D.X \u2013 projected only\n* D.XI \u2013 projected only\n* D.XII \u2013 projected only\n* [[LFG Roland D.XIII|D.XIII]] \u2013 development abandoned when destroyed in a fire\n* [[LFG Roland D.XIV|D.XIV]] \u2013 fighter, variant of D.XIII, very unreliable\n* [[LFG Roland D.XV|D.XV]] \u2013 fighter, three of a first design built, two of a second design also named D.XV\n* [[LFG Roland D.XVI|D.XVI]] \u2013 fighter, prototypes only\n* [[LFG Roland D.XVII|D.XVII]] \u2013  [[Monoplane#Parasol wing|parasol-wing monoplane]] fighter, one built\n* [[LFG Roland G.I|G.I]] \u2013 single engine biplane bomber, only one built\n* [[LFG Roland ME 8]] \u2013 Seaplane fighter, only projected\n* [[LFG Roland MD 14]] \u2013 reconnaissance, only projected\n* [[LFG Roland MD 15]] \u2013 reconnaissance, only projected\n* [[LFG V 3 Susanna|V 3 Susanna]] \u2013 pusher flying boat\n* [[LFG V 8 B\u00e4rbel |V 8 B\u00e4rbel]] \u2013 pusher flying boat\n* [[LFG V 13|V 13 and V 130]] ''Strela'' \u2013 airliner, latter mounted on floats\n* [[LFG V 14|V 14]] -
