As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]\n\nA '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them.\n\nUsually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a \"researcher\" or \"research assistant\", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.\n\nGhostwriting (or simply \"ghosting\") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}</ref> In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; [[Andy Warhol]] engaged in this practice, supervising an [[assembly line]] [[silk screen]] process for his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ \"correspondence officers\" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.\n\nGhostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred page autobiography or \"how-to\" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==Remuneration and credit==\n[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]\n\nGhostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is \"between $15,000 and $75,000\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=What is Ghostwriting?

One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable.

Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that \"book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000\u201342,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.\n\nOn the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which \"is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs.Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200 to 300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}</ref> The true tests of credibility\u2014the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft\u2014become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.\n\nIn some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.\n\nFor nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a \"contributor\" or a \"research assistant\". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between \"author\" and \"writer\", as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: \"A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Nonfiction===\nGhostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book.\n\nIn some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F.

For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or \"[[vanity press]]\"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.\n\n===Fiction===\nGhostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known \"name\" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.\n\nAdditionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the \"author\" is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, \"[[Carolyn Keene]]\" and \"[[Franklin W. Dixon]]\", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on pseudonyms or [[pen name]]<nowiki/>s). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.\n\nThe estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].\n\nSometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\" (also known as \"Under the Pyramids\") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Religious===\nA number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters.

A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.<ref>\"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game\" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)</ref> Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.\n\n====Popular music====\nMusical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.\n\nLegal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.\n\n[[File: Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malm\u00f6 1991.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has offered a more positive view of ghostwriting in hip hop.]]\nIn [[hip hop music]], the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy. Critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the \"perversion of hip-hop by commerce.\" This is because of the limiting definition of \"rapping\" as \"...about you expressing yourself through your own words, not someone else\u2019s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/hiphops_ghostwriters.php|title=Gelf Magazine Hip-Hop's Ghostwriters|work=gelfmagazine.com}}</ref> [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] thinks this point of view is mistaken because \"...not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Books of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop|first=Adam|last=Bradley|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkGXXDZsFHcC&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=book+of+rhymes+the+poetics+of+hip+hop+ghostwriter&source=bl&ots=TBx9S8aMaM&sig=wUcAYQdgCno2j58a7dBgz-93IT8&hl=en&ei=InOiS6qhNMmUtgf34aTuCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref> He points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents. [[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].\n\nCurrently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: \"silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.\" In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for \"vocal arrangement\", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}</ref> have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.\n\n===Visual art===\nGhost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term \"vanity artwork\" as suggestive of \"vanity publishing\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===As blacklisting countermeasure===\nIn countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are \"blacklisted\" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.

As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]\n\nA '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them.\n\nUsually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a \"researcher\" or \"research assistant\", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.\n\nGhostwriting (or simply \"ghosting\") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}</ref> In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; [[Andy Warhol]] engaged in this practice, supervising an [[assembly line]] [[silk screen]] process for his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ \"correspondence officers\" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.\n\nGhostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred page autobiography or \"how-to\" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==Remuneration and credit==\n[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]\n\nGhostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is \"between $15,000 and $75,000\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=What is Ghostwriting?

One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable.

Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that \"book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000\u201342,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.\n\nOn the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which \"is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs.Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200 to 300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}</ref> The true tests of credibility\u2014the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft\u2014become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.\n\nIn some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.\n\nFor nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a \"contributor\" or a \"research assistant\". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between \"author\" and \"writer\", as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: \"A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Nonfiction===\nGhostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book.\n\nIn some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F.

No, who actually wrote it?|work=washingtonpost.com|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n \nA consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an \"expert\" in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or \"[[vanity press]]\"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.\n\n===Fiction===\nGhostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known \"name\" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.\n\nAdditionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the \"author\" is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, \"[[Carolyn Keene]]\" and \"[[Franklin W. Dixon]]\", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on pseudonyms or [[pen name]]<nowiki/>s). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.\n\nThe estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].\n\nSometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\" (also known as \"Under the Pyramids\") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Religious===\nA number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters.

As opposed to cases of plagiarism that stem from a [[copy-and-paste]] reuse of previous work, essays and assignments that are obtained through ghostwriting services as a rule have the originality of their text confirmed by [[plagiarism detection]] software packages or online services that are widely used by universities.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/>\n\nUniversities have developed strategies to combat this type of academic services, which can be associated with [[academic fraud]], that are offered to students and researchers. Some universities allow professors to give students [[oral examination]]s on papers which a professor believes to be 'ghostwritten.\u2019 If the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he or she has submitted, then the student can be charged with academic fraud.\n\n===Medical===\n{{Main|Medical ghostwriter}}\nWith medical ghostwriting, [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then pay other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these papers before they are published in medical or scientific journals.

The [[European Medical Writers Association]] have published guidelines which aim to ensure professional medical writers carry out this role in an ethical and responsible manner.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=A. |last2=Wager |first2=E. |title=European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) guidelines on the role of medical writers in developing peer-reviewed publications |journal=[[Current Medical Research and Opinion|Curr Med Res Opin]] |year=2005 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=317\u2013321 |doi=10.1185/030079905x25578 }}</ref> The use of properly acknowledged medical writers is accepted as legitimate by organisations such as the World Association of Medical Editors<ref name=\"wame\"/> and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|title=Resources for authors|work=bmj.com|access-date=2008-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222214144/http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|archive-date=2008-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> Moreover, professional medical writers' expertise in presenting scientific data may be of benefit in producing better quality papers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schultz |first=H.

Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s. Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a \"house pseudonym\", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.\n\nSome celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites\u2014sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author. This goes for social media as well. Many public figures have ghostwriters at least partially handle their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts, among others.<ref name=\"PC World\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048479/whos-actually-writing-your-favorite-celebritys-tweets-.html|title=Who's actually writing your favorite celebrity's tweets?|author=Evan Dashevsky|date=16 December 2013|work=PC World}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n\n====Classical music and film scores====\n[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|upright|The Classical era composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons who wished to give the impression that they were gifted composers.]]\n[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}</ref> In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a \"person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way.\" The practice is considered one of the \"dirty little secrets of the film and television music business\" that is considered unethical,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film & TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}</ref> but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a \"hummer\" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).\n\nThe practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.<ref>\"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game\" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)</ref> Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.\n\n====Popular music====\nMusical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.\n\nLegal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.\n\n[[File: Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malm\u00f6 1991.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has offered a more positive view of ghostwriting in hip hop.]]\nIn [[hip hop music]], the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy. Critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the \"perversion of hip-hop by commerce.\" This is because of the limiting definition of \"rapping\" as \"...about you expressing yourself through your own words, not someone else\u2019s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/hiphops_ghostwriters.php|title=Gelf Magazine Hip-Hop's Ghostwriters|work=gelfmagazine.com}}</ref> [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] thinks this point of view is mistaken because \"...not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Books of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop|first=Adam|last=Bradley|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkGXXDZsFHcC&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=book+of+rhymes+the+poetics+of+hip+hop+ghostwriter&source=bl&ots=TBx9S8aMaM&sig=wUcAYQdgCno2j58a7dBgz-93IT8&hl=en&ei=InOiS6qhNMmUtgf34aTuCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref> He points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents. [[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].\n\nCurrently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: \"silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.\" In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for \"vocal arrangement\", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}</ref> have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.\n\n===Visual art===\nGhost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term \"vanity artwork\" as suggestive of \"vanity publishing\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===As blacklisting countermeasure===\nIn countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are \"blacklisted\" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.
