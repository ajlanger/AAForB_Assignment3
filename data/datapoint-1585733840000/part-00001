It is currently the [[List of container shipping companies by ship fleets and containers|world's fifth largest container carrier in terms of vessel capacity]].\n\nThe company was formed in 1970 by the merger of two German transportation/maritime companies, [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-American Line (HAPAG)]], which dated from 1847, and [[Norddeutscher Lloyd|Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) or North German Lloyd (NGL)]], which was formed in 1857.\n\nSince its formation, Hapag-Lloyd has been sold to many organizations and has also undergone numerous [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] with other companies. For instance, Hapag-Lloyd was completely acquired by, and became a [[subsidiary]] of [[TUI AG]] ([[Hanover]]) in 1998. This major event was followed by TUI selling a majority stake of Hapag-Lloyd to [[Albert Ballin|various private investors in Hamburg]] in 2009 and again in 2012.

In 1912, Hapag built the first of their \"Big Three\" ocean liners; the ''[[SS Imperator|Imperator]]'', followed by her sister ''[[SS Leviathan|Vaterland]]''. The third sister, ''[[SS Bismarck|Bismarck]]'', was under construction at the outbreak of [[World War I]] and was completed after the war for [[White Star Line]] as the [[RMS Majestic|''Majestic'']]. These were the first liners to exceed 50,000 gross tons and 900 feet in length. During [[World War I]], the majority of Hapag's fleet of 175 ships were wiped out, and most of the surviving ships (including the \"Big Three\") had to be turned over to the winning side as war reparations. After war's end, Hapag rebuilt its fleet with much smaller ships than before the war, but their fleet was again mostly wiped out during [[World War II]], with surviving ships turned over to allied powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/hamburg.html|title=Hamburg America Line|publisher=Ships List|accessdate=22 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525231134/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/hamburg.html|archive-date=2011-05-25}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|1900 Hoboken Docks Fire|Albert Ballin}}\n\n===North German Lloyd===\n{{Main|Norddeutscher Lloyd}}\n[[File:Kaiser-wilhelm-II liner.jpg|thumb|right|The NDL liner ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'', which made its maiden voyage in 1903]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09397, Bremerhaven, Schiffe \"Europa\" und \"Bremen\".jpg|thumb|right|Flagships of North German Lloyd - ''[[SS Bremen (1929)|Bremen]]'' and ''[[SS Europa (1928)|Europa]]'']]\nNorddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) was formed in 1857 in the City-State of [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], offering passenger and cargo transportation between Bremen and New York, with an emphasis on emigration to the United States.
