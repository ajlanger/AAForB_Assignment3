One of the main tourist attractions is the [[Kiama Blowhole]]. Kiama features several popular surfing beaches and caravan parks, and numerous alfresco cafes and restaurants. Its proximity to the south of Sydney makes it an attractive destination for many day-trippers and people wanting to stay numerous nights.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lighthouse, Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse at Kiama]]\nKiama was the site of two strong volcanic flows, called the Gerringong Volcanics, which came out of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]], now a collapsed volcanic vent. The Kiama Blowhole is part of an erosion process on the more recent rock, formed into columnar basalt, or [[latite]]. Before the cedar-getters (comprising ex-convicts, convicts and runaways, some with cedar licences and many without) arrived in the area around 1810, the local [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Wodi Wodi]] of the language group [[Dharawal]], had been using the land for thousands of years, moving every six weeks or so in family groups. This is supported by a midden of shells at nearby Bass Point used for more than 17,000 years. During this time the whole coastal hills was covered in rainforest and cedar brush. There is evidence of a flourishing culture with intricate possum cloaks, a developed song and story cycle, and a deep understanding of the many plants of the rainforest. Only a few remnants of rainforest survive along the escarpment in places like the Minnamurra Rainforest Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id%3DN0069%26s%3D20080510000000124 |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020104430/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id=N0069&s=20080510000000124 |title=Budderoo National Park |archivedate=20 October 2009 }}</ref>\nThere is strong evidence of recent sea debris showing a mega-tsunami hit this coast around 1487 A.D according to Dr Ted Bryant of Wollongong University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Tsunami Introduction \u2013 School of Earth and Environmental Sciences @ UOW|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321051744/http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |archivedate=21 March 2009 }}</ref> The first European to explore the area was [[George Bass]] who stopped there on 6 December 1797 and viewed Kiama's blowhole.\n\nDuring the early settlement of eastern Australia, the Kiama area was settled by wheat farmers, since the soil was volcanic and rain-swept unlike most of Australia. Early Jamberoo was the population centre from about 1830 to the 1860s and when the wheat failed to grow, the farmers switched to dairying. During this period Kiama became the best example of '[[chain migration]]' in Australia as many assisted migrants came from Northern Ireland on clearing leases and eventually half the marriages in the Kiama Anglican Church in a hundred years had Northern Irish Protestant ancestry. Kiama was one of the birthplaces of the Australian dairy industry with the first Dairy Factory ([[Kiama Pioneer Butter Factory|The Kiama Pioneer Factory]]) and first Dairy Co-operative in Australia. There were three original major land grants, Thomas Surfleet Kendall (son of lapsed missionary Reverend [[Thomas Kendall]]), Michael Hindmarsh and Matthew Cignarella, all of which married sisters of the Rutter family. The Kendalls were cousins of [[Henry Kendall (poet)|Henry Kendall]], the famous Australian poet. The Kendall name is remembered today in several places such as the spooky [[Kendall Cemetery]] in [[Kiama Heights]] and [[Kendalls Beach]]. The Hindmarshs are remembered in Kiama's main park, Hindmarsh Park, and after 10 generations still live on their original land.\n\nKiama's next population boom was powered by its quarries, which multiplied rapidly in the early years of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dunn\">{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Elaine M.|title=Kiama: Its region and community 1901 to 1938|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1644&context=theses&type=additional|website=ro.uow.edu.au|publisher=University of Wollongong|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Many Irish Catholics worked in the Kiama quarries. The basalt formed by two volcanic eruptions 240 million years and 66&nbsp;million years ago was a valuable commodity for a growing colony, with the blue metal used to pave Sydney's roads and as ballast for its railways. It was very similar to the basalt found in Northern Ireland, where the Giant's Causeway is a famous example. There are still active quarries in the Kiama area, including the N.S.W. Railway Quarry, and the remnants of earlier quarries are easily visible throughout the town and often have facilities built inside them such as the Kiama Leisure Centre. One particular quarry, the Bombo Headland, is of scientific importance as it is the site of the discovery of the longest known geomagnetic polarity interval called the [[Geomagnetic reversal#Superchrons|Kiaman Reverse Superchron]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.07.041|last=Cottrell|first=Rory D.|last2=Tarduno|first2=John A|last3=Roberts|first3=John|title=The Kiaman Reversed Polarity Superchron at Kiama: Toward a field strength estimate based on single silicate crystals|journal=[[Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors]]|volume=169|pages=49\u201358|year=2008|bibcode=2008PEPI..169...49C}}</ref>\n\nWhen Kiama Harbour was hollowed out after 17 years' work, and flooded in 1876, larger steamers such as from the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company could enter and a flourishing sea trade followed. Staithes for loading crushed [[Construction aggregate|blue metal stone]] directly into ships from rail trucks were installed along the eastern end of the harbour, allowing regular shipments to be taken to Sydney for the railways and road construction. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage was finished in 1881 and the Kiama Lighthouse in 1887. Kiama really hit its boom time in this period, from 1890 until the Great Depression in 1927, when many of the quarries closed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It was a prosperous and happy time well recorded in the local newspaper, the Kiama Independent and the photographs of the Cocks Photographic Studio, two valuable resources which tell most of the Kiama story.\n\nOver time tourism and housing growth turned Kiama into a dormitory suburb (where people travelled away to work) and summer tourist spot. Kiama in 2009 is a tourism haven in summer, during which its population triples. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage is now a local history museum. Nearby, on Black Beach, is a memorial to the blue metal freighter [[SS Bombo]], which capsized and sank outside [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] harbour in a huge gale after departing Kiama for Sydney on 24 February 1949. Twelve of the fourteen crew were lost.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nKiama has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 24\u201340 and 42\u201344 Collins Street: [[Collins Street wooden terraces, Kiama]]<ref name=nswshr-472>{{cite NSW SHR|5045308|Wooden Terraces|hr=00472|fn=EF14/4793; S90/2611; HC 33091|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-473>{{cite NSW SHR|5045333|Wooden Terraces|hr=00473|fn=EF14/4793; HC33091, 9870|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 46 Collins Street: [[Kiama Masonic Temple]]<ref name=nswshr-474>{{cite NSW SHR|5045312|Masonic Temple|hr=00474|fn=HC 33091, 9869|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Illawarra railway: [[Kiama railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1176>{{cite NSW SHR|5012065|Kiama Railway Station Group and Turntable|hr=01176|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Irvine Street: [[Kiama Reservoirs]]<ref name=nswshr-1626>{{cite NSW SHR|5053864|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0231)|hr=01626|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1627>{{cite NSW SHR|5053865|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0232)|hr=01627|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 16\u201320 Manning Street: [[CBC Bank Building, Kiama|CBC Bank Building]]<ref name=nswshr-143>{{cite NSW SHR|5045696|CBC Bank (former)|hr=00143|fn=S90/05746 & HC 32558|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Shoalhaven Street: [[Scots Presbyterian Church, Kiama|Scots Presbyterian Church]]<ref name=nswshr-120>{{cite NSW SHR|5045566|Scots Presbyterian Church, Land and Trees|hr=00120|fn=S90/06026 & HC 32269|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 24 Terralong Street: [[Kiama Post Office]]<ref name=nswshr-1426>{{cite NSW SHR|5051275|Kiama Post Office|hr=01426|fn=H00/00203|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Kiama area includes many attractions, being situated on the coast south of the [[Minnamurra River]], and to the west lie the foothills of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] and the smaller less discernible peak of Mount Brandon. Also to the west is the town of [[Jamberoo, New South Wales|Jamberoo]] with pasture-land in between, which contains many historic buildings and [[dry stone wall]]s. Also of note is [[Seven Mile Beach, New South Wales|Seven Mile Beach]] to the south, a protected reserve. Kiama has several well-known surfing beaches, including Surf Beach, 'Mystics' and Boyds' Beach, as well as other more protected swimming beaches situated in coves between headlands such as Black Beach, Easts Beach and Kendalls Beach. Kiama Harbour forms one of several coves between headlands.\n\n===Climate===\nKiama is the southern edge of the [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa''), being the southernmost city entirely in this climatic zone<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-australia-new-zealand.php|title=Interactive Australia / New Zealand Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> with warm summers and mild winters.

By road, Kiama is about 55 minutes from the southern edge of Sydney, and 100 minutes from the city centre, via the [[Princes Highway]].\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Kiama Town Council.jpg|thumb|the Town Council of Kiama]]\n[[File:Memorial Arch in Kiama, NSW.jpg|thumb|Memorial Arch]]\n[[File:Post office in Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Post office]]\n[[File:Kiama Harbour.jpg|thumb|View of Kiama Harbour from Black Beach]]\n\nThe beaches around Kiama offer a large range of surfing conditions. Many surfing competitions are held here every year. These include Boyds Beach \u2013 [[Kiama Downs]], Bombo Beach \u2013 [[Bombo, New South Wales|Bombo]], Surf Beach \u2013 Kiama, Easts Beach and Caravan Park \u2013 Kiama Heights, Kendalls Beach \u2013 Kiama and Mystics Beach \u2013 [[Minnamurra River]].\n\nThe name \"Kiama\" is derived from the [[Aborgine language|Aboriginal word]] \"''kiarama''\", which means \"Place where the sea makes a noise\". Kiama is also known as the place where the mountains touch the sea.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/downloads/southcoast/kiama_ramps_apx_e_urban_design_report.pdf Kiama Ramps additional access ramps Apx E \u2013 Visual assessment and urban design strategy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is in reference to the [[Kiama Blowhole]] which attracts many visitors annually. The \"Little Blowhole\" is a lesser known blowhole as it does not share the same central location or the scale associated with the larger [[Kiama Blowhole]]. The Little Blowhole is on a headland south of the central part of Kiama between Easts and Kendalls Beaches.\n\nBoth have areas for viewing, though the Kiama Blowhole attracts more tourists. A coastal walking track currently allows people to walk from Minnamurra to Easts Beach, past both blowholes. A 7 kilometre southern extension to this path has been opened to allow people to walk along the cliffs to [[Gerringong, New South Wales|Gerringong]].\n\nA few kilometres north at Bombo is Cathedral Rocks, a formation well known and visited, with a walk/cycleway going along the Kiama coast. There are other rock formations on these cliff headlands of moderate renown.\n\nThe Kiama Post Office, one of many historic buildings, is known for its history and pink colour, although it was repainted in 2012. It is situated near Black Beach.\n\nKiama has a strip mall of caf\u00e9s, restaurants, art galleries and shops on Terralong Street. Also on this street is a war memorial, an historic fire station used for exhibits, and a small shopping centre. There is a strong arts following and interest in cultural events in Kiama, and in 2013 an arts trail was introduced to showcase the work of individual artists, together with regular arts events in the area. Food and wine trails are also becoming more popular in the area.\n\n[[Kiama Light]]house, on Blowhole Point, was built in 1887<ref>{{cite loa|NSW|Kiama|The Kiama Lighthouse}}</ref> and is situated close to the Kiama Blowhole. The point also contains a heritage pilot's cottage and a tourist information centre. North West of the Blowhole is Kiama Harbour, home to fishing boats and seafood market where you can buy local fish. The point also contains seaside cabins and a wonderful rock pool.\n\nA locally famous phenomenon is the local group of Australian [[Pelican]]s. The pelicans have been honoured with a metal statue at the harbour.\n\nSeven kilometres southwest of the town is Saddleback Lookout atop the 600-metre high [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] with views over the [[Illawarra Plains]] and escarpment and south to Nowra, Pigeon House Mountain and Coolangatta Mountain. Saddleback and Noorinan mountains provide an impressive backdrop to the city.\n\nThe [[Jamberoo Action Park]], a mainly ride-orientated water-themed park, is situated 10 minutes inland of Kiama in the small town of Jamberoo.\n\nWest of Kiama in the green hills lies Jerrara Dam, built in the 1800s to supply water to the area. It is now a reserve.\n\nNorth of the [[Minnamurra River]] is [[Killalea Recreation Area]], a nature reserve on Bass Point. It is south of [[Shellharbour, New South Wales|Shellharbour]].\n\nKiama Council spent eleven years preparing the construction of the Kiama Coast Walk, a six-kilometre track extending from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon, near Gerringong, south of Kiama. Some coastal land was declared public reserve to allow the public to walk through what was previously private property. The track was scheduled to open in October 2009 and was expected to be a popular drawcard for the public.<ref>Daily Telegraph, 4 September 2009, p.30</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nKiama is home to several schools, including [[Kiama High School]], [[Kiama Public School]] and [[Ss Peter and Paul Catholic School]]. Two vocational education and training (VET) providers also have their headquarters in Kiama, the Kiama Community College and National Training Masters. The local [[TAFE NSW]] College is located at [[Shellharbour]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cathedral Rock, Kiama from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|Cathedral Rock, Kiama, circa 1900\nFile:Kiama

One of the main tourist attractions is the [[Kiama Blowhole]]. Kiama features several popular surfing beaches and caravan parks, and numerous alfresco cafes and restaurants. Its proximity to the south of Sydney makes it an attractive destination for many day-trippers and people wanting to stay numerous nights.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lighthouse, Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse at Kiama]]\nKiama was the site of two strong volcanic flows, called the Gerringong Volcanics, which came out of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]], now a collapsed volcanic vent. The Kiama Blowhole is part of an erosion process on the more recent rock, formed into columnar basalt, or [[latite]]. Before the cedar-getters (comprising ex-convicts, convicts and runaways, some with cedar licences and many without) arrived in the area around 1810, the local [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Wodi Wodi]] of the language group [[Dharawal]], had been using the land for thousands of years, moving every six weeks or so in family groups. This is supported by a midden of shells at nearby Bass Point used for more than 17,000 years. During this time the whole coastal hills was covered in rainforest and cedar brush. There is evidence of a flourishing culture with intricate possum cloaks, a developed song and story cycle, and a deep understanding of the many plants of the rainforest. Only a few remnants of rainforest survive along the escarpment in places like the Minnamurra Rainforest Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id%3DN0069%26s%3D20080510000000124 |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020104430/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id=N0069&s=20080510000000124 |title=Budderoo National Park |archivedate=20 October 2009 }}</ref>\nThere is strong evidence of recent sea debris showing a mega-tsunami hit this coast around 1487 A.D according to Dr Ted Bryant of Wollongong University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Tsunami Introduction \u2013 School of Earth and Environmental Sciences @ UOW|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321051744/http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |archivedate=21 March 2009 }}</ref> The first European to explore the area was [[George Bass]] who stopped there on 6 December 1797 and viewed Kiama's blowhole.\n\nDuring the early settlement of eastern Australia, the Kiama area was settled by wheat farmers, since the soil was volcanic and rain-swept unlike most of Australia. Early Jamberoo was the population centre from about 1830 to the 1860s and when the wheat failed to grow, the farmers switched to dairying. During this period Kiama became the best example of '[[chain migration]]' in Australia as many assisted migrants came from Northern Ireland on clearing leases and eventually half the marriages in the Kiama Anglican Church in a hundred years had Northern Irish Protestant ancestry. Kiama was one of the birthplaces of the Australian dairy industry with the first Dairy Factory ([[Kiama Pioneer Butter Factory|The Kiama Pioneer Factory]]) and first Dairy Co-operative in Australia. There were three original major land grants, Thomas Surfleet Kendall (son of lapsed missionary Reverend [[Thomas Kendall]]), Michael Hindmarsh and Matthew Cignarella, all of which married sisters of the Rutter family. The Kendalls were cousins of [[Henry Kendall (poet)|Henry Kendall]], the famous Australian poet. The Kendall name is remembered today in several places such as the spooky [[Kendall Cemetery]] in [[Kiama Heights]] and [[Kendalls Beach]]. The Hindmarshs are remembered in Kiama's main park, Hindmarsh Park, and after 10 generations still live on their original land.\n\nKiama's next population boom was powered by its quarries, which multiplied rapidly in the early years of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dunn\">{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Elaine M.|title=Kiama: Its region and community 1901 to 1938|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1644&context=theses&type=additional|website=ro.uow.edu.au|publisher=University of Wollongong|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Many Irish Catholics worked in the Kiama quarries. The basalt formed by two volcanic eruptions 240 million years and 66&nbsp;million years ago was a valuable commodity for a growing colony, with the blue metal used to pave Sydney's roads and as ballast for its railways. It was very similar to the basalt found in Northern Ireland, where the Giant's Causeway is a famous example. There are still active quarries in the Kiama area, including the N.S.W. Railway Quarry, and the remnants of earlier quarries are easily visible throughout the town and often have facilities built inside them such as the Kiama Leisure Centre. One particular quarry, the Bombo Headland, is of scientific importance as it is the site of the discovery of the longest known geomagnetic polarity interval called the [[Geomagnetic reversal#Superchrons|Kiaman Reverse Superchron]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.07.041|last=Cottrell|first=Rory D.|last2=Tarduno|first2=John A|last3=Roberts|first3=John|title=The Kiaman Reversed Polarity Superchron at Kiama: Toward a field strength estimate based on single silicate crystals|journal=[[Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors]]|volume=169|pages=49\u201358|year=2008|bibcode=2008PEPI..169...49C}}</ref>\n\nWhen Kiama Harbour was hollowed out after 17 years' work, and flooded in 1876, larger steamers such as from the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company could enter and a flourishing sea trade followed. Staithes for loading crushed [[Construction aggregate|blue metal stone]] directly into ships from rail trucks were installed along the eastern end of the harbour, allowing regular shipments to be taken to Sydney for the railways and road construction. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage was finished in 1881 and the Kiama Lighthouse in 1887. Kiama really hit its boom time in this period, from 1890 until the Great Depression in 1927, when many of the quarries closed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It was a prosperous and happy time well recorded in the local newspaper, the Kiama Independent and the photographs of the Cocks Photographic Studio, two valuable resources which tell most of the Kiama story.\n\nOver time tourism and housing growth turned Kiama into a dormitory suburb (where people travelled away to work) and summer tourist spot. Kiama in 2009 is a tourism haven in summer, during which its population triples. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage is now a local history museum. Nearby, on Black Beach, is a memorial to the blue metal freighter [[SS Bombo]], which capsized and sank outside [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] harbour in a huge gale after departing Kiama for Sydney on 24 February 1949. Twelve of the fourteen crew were lost.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nKiama has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 24\u201340 and 42\u201344 Collins Street: [[Collins Street wooden terraces, Kiama]]<ref name=nswshr-472>{{cite NSW SHR|5045308|Wooden Terraces|hr=00472|fn=EF14/4793; S90/2611; HC 33091|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-473>{{cite NSW SHR|5045333|Wooden Terraces|hr=00473|fn=EF14/4793; HC33091, 9870|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 46 Collins Street: [[Kiama Masonic Temple]]<ref name=nswshr-474>{{cite NSW SHR|5045312|Masonic Temple|hr=00474|fn=HC 33091, 9869|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Illawarra railway: [[Kiama railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1176>{{cite NSW SHR|5012065|Kiama Railway Station Group and Turntable|hr=01176|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Irvine Street: [[Kiama Reservoirs]]<ref name=nswshr-1626>{{cite NSW SHR|5053864|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0231)|hr=01626|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1627>{{cite NSW SHR|5053865|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0232)|hr=01627|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 16\u201320 Manning Street: [[CBC Bank Building, Kiama|CBC Bank Building]]<ref name=nswshr-143>{{cite NSW SHR|5045696|CBC Bank (former)|hr=00143|fn=S90/05746 & HC 32558|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Shoalhaven Street: [[Scots Presbyterian Church, Kiama|Scots Presbyterian Church]]<ref name=nswshr-120>{{cite NSW SHR|5045566|Scots Presbyterian Church, Land and Trees|hr=00120|fn=S90/06026 & HC 32269|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 24 Terralong Street: [[Kiama Post Office]]<ref name=nswshr-1426>{{cite NSW SHR|5051275|Kiama Post Office|hr=01426|fn=H00/00203|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Kiama area includes many attractions, being situated on the coast south of the [[Minnamurra River]], and to the west lie the foothills of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] and the smaller less discernible peak of Mount Brandon. Also to the west is the town of [[Jamberoo, New South Wales|Jamberoo]] with pasture-land in between, which contains many historic buildings and [[dry stone wall]]s. Also of note is [[Seven Mile Beach, New South Wales|Seven Mile Beach]] to the south, a protected reserve. Kiama has several well-known surfing beaches, including Surf Beach, 'Mystics' and Boyds' Beach, as well as other more protected swimming beaches situated in coves between headlands such as Black Beach, Easts Beach and Kendalls Beach. Kiama Harbour forms one of several coves between headlands.\n\n===Climate===\nKiama is the southern edge of the [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa''), being the southernmost city entirely in this climatic zone<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-australia-new-zealand.php|title=Interactive Australia / New Zealand Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> with warm summers and mild winters.

By road, Kiama is about 55 minutes from the southern edge of Sydney, and 100 minutes from the city centre, via the [[Princes Highway]].\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Kiama Town Council.jpg|thumb|the Town Council of Kiama]]\n[[File:Memorial Arch in Kiama, NSW.jpg|thumb|Memorial Arch]]\n[[File:Post office in Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Post office]]\n[[File:Kiama Harbour.jpg|thumb|View of Kiama Harbour from Black Beach]]\n\nThe beaches around Kiama offer a large range of surfing conditions. Many surfing competitions are held here every year. These include Boyds Beach \u2013 [[Kiama Downs]], Bombo Beach \u2013 [[Bombo, New South Wales|Bombo]], Surf Beach \u2013 Kiama, Easts Beach and Caravan Park \u2013 Kiama Heights, Kendalls Beach \u2013 Kiama and Mystics Beach \u2013 [[Minnamurra River]].\n\nThe name \"Kiama\" is derived from the [[Aborgine language|Aboriginal word]] \"''kiarama''\", which means \"Place where the sea makes a noise\". Kiama is also known as the place where the mountains touch the sea.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/downloads/southcoast/kiama_ramps_apx_e_urban_design_report.pdf Kiama Ramps additional access ramps Apx E \u2013 Visual assessment and urban design strategy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is in reference to the [[Kiama Blowhole]] which attracts many visitors annually. The \"Little Blowhole\" is a lesser known blowhole as it does not share the same central location or the scale associated with the larger [[Kiama Blowhole]]. The Little Blowhole is on a headland south of the central part of Kiama between Easts and Kendalls Beaches.\n\nBoth have areas for viewing, though the Kiama Blowhole attracts more tourists. A coastal walking track currently allows people to walk from Minnamurra to Easts Beach, past both blowholes. A 7 kilometre southern extension to this path has been opened to allow people to walk along the cliffs to [[Gerringong, New South Wales|Gerringong]].\n\nA few kilometres north at Bombo is Cathedral Rocks, a formation well known and visited, with a walk/cycleway going along the Kiama coast. There are other rock formations on these cliff headlands of moderate renown.\n\nThe Kiama Post Office, one of many historic buildings, is known for its history and pink colour, although it was repainted in 2012. It is situated near Black Beach.\n\nKiama has a strip mall of caf\u00e9s, restaurants, art galleries and shops on Terralong Street. Also on this street is a war memorial, an historic fire station used for exhibits, and a small shopping centre. There is a strong arts following and interest in cultural events in Kiama, and in 2013 an arts trail was introduced to showcase the work of individual artists, together with regular arts events in the area. Food and wine trails are also becoming more popular in the area.\n\n[[Kiama Light]]house, on Blowhole Point, was built in 1887<ref>{{cite loa|NSW|Kiama|The Kiama Lighthouse}}</ref> and is situated close to the Kiama Blowhole. The point also contains a heritage pilot's cottage and a tourist information centre. North West of the Blowhole is Kiama Harbour, home to fishing boats and seafood market where you can buy local fish. The point also contains seaside cabins and a wonderful rock pool.\n\nA locally famous phenomenon is the local group of Australian [[Pelican]]s. The pelicans have been honoured with a metal statue at the harbour.\n\nSeven kilometres southwest of the town is Saddleback Lookout atop the 600-metre high [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] with views over the [[Illawarra Plains]] and escarpment and south to Nowra, Pigeon House Mountain and Coolangatta Mountain. Saddleback and Noorinan mountains provide an impressive backdrop to the city.\n\nThe [[Jamberoo Action Park]], a mainly ride-orientated water-themed park, is situated 10 minutes inland of Kiama in the small town of Jamberoo.\n\nWest of Kiama in the green hills lies Jerrara Dam, built in the 1800s to supply water to the area. It is now a reserve.\n\nNorth of the [[Minnamurra River]] is [[Killalea Recreation Area]], a nature reserve on Bass Point. It is south of [[Shellharbour, New South Wales|Shellharbour]].\n\nKiama Council spent eleven years preparing the construction of the Kiama Coast Walk, a six-kilometre track extending from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon, near Gerringong, south of Kiama. Some coastal land was declared public reserve to allow the public to walk through what was previously private property. The track was scheduled to open in October 2009 and was expected to be a popular drawcard for the public.<ref>Daily Telegraph, 4 September 2009, p.30</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nKiama is home to several schools, including [[Kiama High School]], [[Kiama Public School]] and [[Ss Peter and Paul Catholic School]]. Two vocational education and training (VET) providers also have their headquarters in Kiama, the Kiama Community College and National Training Masters. The local [[TAFE NSW]] College is located at [[Shellharbour]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cathedral Rock, Kiama from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|Cathedral Rock, Kiama, circa 1900\nFile:Kiama harbour 1.JPG|Kiama harbour\nFile:Kiama harbour 2.JPG|Kiama harbour\nFile:Kiama post office.jpg|Kiama post office\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[David Balding|Prof David Balding]] (born 10 March 1961), Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor of Statistical Genomics at the University of Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/statisticalgenomics/|title=University of Melbourne|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/profile/david-balding|title=David Balding, Australian Academy of Science|last=|first=|date=|website=www.science.org.au|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n*[[Peter Knott]] (born 8 August 1956) represented Gilmore from 1993 to 1996 for the Australian Labor Party (ALP).\n* [[Matt Brown (Australian politician)|Matt Brown]] (born 1972), member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for Kiama<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Mr (Matt) Matthew James Brown \n |work=Members of Parliament \n |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] \n |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/Members.nsf/d890a06557517cedca256e700008765e/0e9604ed2e89485b4a256760000caa06?OpenDocument \n |accessdate=12 February 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329115229/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/Members.nsf/d890a06557517cedca256e700008765e/0e9604ed2e89485b4a256760000caa06?OpenDocument \n |archivedate=29 March 2010 \n}}</ref>\n<!-- *Harold Percival \"Percy\" Christmas, founder of [[Woolworths Limited]]-->\n* [[Charmian Clift]] (1923\u20131969), writer and essayist<ref>{{cite book|author=Wheatley, N.|year=2001|title=The Life and Myth of Charmian Clift|publisher=Flamingo (Harper Collins)|location=Sydney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLN5NQAACAAJ}}</ref>\n<!--* [[Australia's Next Top Model, Cycle 4|Alyce Crawford (model)]]-->\n*Sir [[George Fuller (Australian politician)|George Fuller]] (1861\u20131940), [[Premier of New South Wales]]<ref>{{cite NSW Parliament| title =Sir George Warburton Fuller (1861\u20131940) |id=1075 |former=Yes |accessdate=16 June 2019 }}</ref>\n* [[Orry George Kelly]] (1897\u20131964), Academy Award-winning dress designer<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140703b.htm Kelly, Orry George biography] at the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]</ref>\n* [[Robbie Maddison]] (born 1981), [[freestyle motocross]] rider{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n* [[Josh Morris (rugby)|Josh Morris]] and [[Brett Morris]], professional rugby league players\n* Alfred Percival (Perce) Bullen<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bullen-alfred-percival-perce-9621|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|website = }}</ref> (1896\u20131974), circus proprietor\n* Charles Edward Devenish Meares<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/meares-charles-edward-devenish-7548|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|website = }}</ref> (1861\u20131940), dairy industry organiser\n* Frederick Phillimore Howell-Price<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/howell-price-frederick-phillimore-7073|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|website = }}</ref> (1888\u20131978) soldier\n*[[Joseph Carruthers]], Premier of NSW, born in Kiama 1857\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kiama, New South Wales}}\n*[http://www.kiama.nsw.gov.au/ Kiama Municipal Council website]\n\n{{Municipality of Kiama suburbs |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Kiama]]\n[[Category:Kiama, New South Wales| ]]\n[[Category:Coastal towns in New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiama,_New_South_Wales"}
