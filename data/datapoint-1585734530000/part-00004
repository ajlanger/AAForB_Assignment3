It is built on the ruins of ancient [[Kition|Citium]], which was the birthplace of [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]. Larnaca is home to the country's primary airport, [[Larnaca International Airport]]. It also has a seaport and a marina.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word Larnaca derives from the Greek n. ''[[larnax]]'', meaning: \"coffer\", \"box\", \"chest\", e.g. for household stores,  \"cinerary urn\", \"sarcophagus\" or \"coffin\"; \"drinking trough\" and \"chalice\". An informal etymology, attributes the origin of the name to ([[sarcophagi]]) that were found in the area.<ref>\"The great number sarcophagoi (larnakes) found at Larnaca may have given to the modern city its name.\" Excerpt of wall mounted text at [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca District Museum]], under the title \"Kition: The necropolis\"</ref> Sophocles Hadjisavvas, a state archeologist, states that \"[the city's U.S.] consul of the last quarter of the 19th century, claimed to have explored more than 3,000 tombs in the area of Larnaca, so-called after the immense number of sarcophagi found in the modern town\".<ref>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111945/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> In the vernacular, Larnaca is also known as '''Scala''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1}} {{IPA-el|\u02c8skala|}} from the word ({{lang-el|\u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1}} {{IPA-el|\u02c8skala|}} a loanword from the Italian {{lang|it|scala}}). During the Middle Ages, until the end of the 18th century, a small port-anchorage close to Larnaca Bay is referred to on maps, engravings, in travel descriptions and documents as '''Scala di Saline''' and may account for this second name; other names that appear on maps are include: Porto delle Salines, Rada delle Saline,  Ponta delle Saline, Punta delle Salino, Golfo delle Saline, Port Salines, Selines, Salines, Le Seline, Le Salline, Saline, Salin, Salinas, Arnicho di Salinas, Port of Lazarus, Lazare [o], Marine, Marina, Commercio [customs].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Street in Larnaca, Cyprus.

Around 1000 BC, Kition was rebuilt by [[Phoenicians]] and it subsequently became a center of Phoenician culture. The remains of the sites include [[cyclopean wall]]s and a complex of five temples and a [[naval]] port.\n\nIt was conquered in the first millennium BC by a series of great powers of the region. First by the [[Assyrian Empire]], then by Egypt. Like most Cypriot cities, Kition belonged to the Persian or [[Achaemenid Empire]]. In 450 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] general [[Cimon]] died at sea, while militarily supporting the revolt against Persia's rule over Cyprus. On his deathbed, he urged his officers to conceal his death from both their allies and the Persians.\n\nStrong<ref name=Guidebook18>{{cite book|last= Flourentzos |first=P.| title= A Guide to the Larnaca District Museum |year=1996 |publisher= Ministry of Communications and Works \u2013 Department of Antiquities|isbn=978-9963-36-425-1 |page=18}}</ref> earthquakes hit the city in 76 AD and the year after.\n\nEarthquakes of 322 AD and 342 \"caused the destruction not only of Kition but also of Salamis and Pafos\".<ref name=Guidebook18/> Kition's harbor silted up, and the population moved to the seafront farther south, sometime after this. (Contributing factors to the silting are thought to have been earthquakes, [[deforestation]] and [[overgrazing]].)\n\nThe [[port|commercial port]] was located at [[Skala (neighborhood in Larnaca)|Skala]], during the [[Ottoman Cyprus|Ottoman Period]].

It usually dries up in the summer. In the past,{{When|date=February 2014}} it yielded good quality salt scraped from the dried surface. The salt from the lake is now considered unsuitable for consumption.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in this area is described by the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification|K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification System]] as a hot [[semi-arid climate]] ([[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|''BSh'']]) due to its low annual rainfall and strong summer drought. It is sometimes described as a [[mediterranean climate]], but its winter rainfall is below the required amount to avoid the semi-arid classification.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Larnaca (extremes 1881\u2013present)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 22.6\n|Feb record high C = 26.2\n|Mar record high C = 30.3\n|Apr record high C = 34.1\n|May record high C = 38.3\n|Jun record high C = 40.1\n|Jul record high C = 41.1\n|Aug record high C = 40.9\n|Sep record high C = 39.7\n|Oct record high C = 34.8\n|Nov record high C = 31.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.6\n|year record high C = 41.1\n|Jan high C = 16.8\n|Feb high C = 16.8\n|Mar high C = 19.1\n|Apr high C = 22.5\n|May high C = 26.5\n|Jun high C = 30.3\n|Jul high C = 32.4\n|Aug high C = 32.7\n|Sep high C = 30.9\n|Oct high C = 28.1\n|Nov high C = 22.6\n|Dec high C = 18.3\n|year high C = 24.7\n|Jan mean C = 12.1\n|Feb mean C = 11.8\n|Mar mean C = 13.9\n|Apr mean C = 17.1\n|May mean C = 21.2\n|Jun mean C = 25.0\n|Jul mean C = 27.3\n|Aug mean C = 27.6\n|Sep mean C = 25.4\n|Oct mean C = 22.6\n|Nov mean C = 17.5\n|Dec mean C = 13.7\n|year mean C = 19.6\n|Jan low C = 7.5\n|Feb low C = 6.9\n|Mar low C = 8.7\n|Apr low C = 11.7\n|May low C = 16.0\n|Jun low C = 19.8\n|Jul low C = 22.2\n|Aug low C = 22.6\n|Sep low C = 19.9\n|Oct low C = 17.1\n|Nov low C = 12.5\n|Dec low C = 9.2\n|year low C = 14.5\n|Jan record low C = -0.9\n|Feb record low C = -1.3\n|Mar record low C = -1.0\n|Apr record low C = 2.0\n|May record low C = 8.5\n|Jun record low C = 12.5\n|Jul record low C = 16.0\n|Aug record low C = 15.6\n|Sep record low C = 12.4\n|Oct record low C = 7.6\n|Nov record low C = 1.9\n|Dec record low C = 0.6\n|year record low C = -1.3\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 40.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 34.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 17.7\n|May precipitation mm =  8.8\n|Jun precipitation mm =  2.7\n|Jul precipitation mm =  0.6\n|Aug precipitation mm =  0.4\n|Sep precipitation mm =  7.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 13.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 53.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 94.5\n|year precipitation mm = 351.5\n|Jan precipitation days = 7.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.5\n|Apr precipitation days = 3.1\n|May precipitation days = 0.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 0.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.1\n|Aug precipitation days = 0.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 0.5\n|Oct precipitation days = 2.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.0\n|year precipitation days = 37.6\n|unit precipitation days = 1&nbsp;mm\n|Jan sun = 195.3\n|Feb sun = 208.8\n|Mar sun = 238.7\n|Apr sun = 267.0\n|May sun = 331.7\n|Jun sun = 378.0\n|Jul sun = 387.5\n|Aug sun = 365.8\n|Sep sun = 312.0\n|Oct sun = 275.9\n[[thumb]]\n|Nov sun = 216.0\n|Dec sun = 179.8\n|year sun = 3356.5\n|source 1 = Meteorological Service (Cyprus)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/MS/MS.nsf/DMLclimet_reports_en/DMLclimet_reports_en?OpenDocument&Start=1&Count=1000&Expand=1\n|title=Meteorological Service \u2013 Climatological and Meteorological Reports\n|accessdate=}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/station-720-Larnaca.php\n| title = Station Maceio\n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n|language = French \n| accessdate = 17 December 2018}}</ref>\n|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n{{wide image|Larnaca banner.jpg|900px|Panoramic view of Phoinikoudes beach}}\n\nThe city's landmarks include: the [[Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca|Church of Saint Lazarus]]; the [[Catacomb of Phaneromeni Church]]; [[Hala Sultan Tekke]]; the [[Bekir Pasha Aqueduct|Kamares Aqueduct]]; and the [[Larnaca Castle|Fort of Larnaca]].\n\nSo-called \"Foinikoudes\" is the [[esplanade|promenade]] along Athenon Avenue on the seafront.

A \u20ac650m upgrade of Larnaca Airport has been completed.\n\nThe service sector, including tourism, employs three-quarters of Larnaca's labour force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Many travel and tour operators and other travel-related companies have a head office Larnaca.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:The Cornaro art institute.JPG|thumb|The former Cornaro Institute in Larnaca was an art school and cultural centre prior to its closure by the municipality in 2017]]\nThere are over a hundred educational institutions in the city,{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} including the [[American Academy of Larnaca|American Academy]], [[Larnaca Armenian school|Larnaca Nareg Armenian school]] and the Alexander College.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Arts===\nLarnaca has a theatre and an art gallery, which are operated by the municipality.

Mackenzie Beach hosts windsurfing centre together with an extreme sports centre.\n\n===Festivals===\nMuch of the activity is centered on the city promenade during the major festivals. The most important of these is ''[[Deluge (mythology)|Kataklysmos]]'' or the ''Festival of the Flood'', celebrated in early summer with a series of cultural events. The festival used to last for about a week, but, in recent years, with the increased commercialism of peripheral stalls, rides and temporary [[Lokma|Loukoumades]] restaurants, the festival has been extended to about three weeks, during which the seafront is closed to traffic in the evenings.\n\n===Museums===\nMuseums found in Larnaca include the [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum]], [[Pierides Museum (Larnaca)|Pierides Museum]], Agios Lazaros Byzantine Museum, Kallinikeio Municipal Museum of Athienou, Larnaca Medieval Museum, Larnaca Municipal Museum of Natural History, Larnaca Municipal Historical Archives - Museum of Larnaca, Folklore Museum \u2018Kostas Kaimakliotis\u2019 - Aradippou, Theasis Museum and [[Kyriazis Medical Museum]].\n\n===Cuisine===\nThe beaches of Larnaca are lined with nearly identical seafood restaurants catering to tourists. Although there are many continental and international restaurants in Larnaca, visitors do not miss out on indulging in the local food. Many of the staple dishes involve beans, such as ''fasolaki'' ([[French beans]] cooked in red wine with lamb), and ''louvi me lahana'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s with [[chard]]).\nSome of the standard appetizers are potato salad, kohlrabi salad, and hot grilled black olives.\nThe next course may include [[Cyprus village sausage]] and [[sheftalia]], [[dolmades]] and [[kefte]]des, [[kolokassi]] in tomato sauce, and several aubergine-based dishes.

It is built on the ruins of ancient [[Kition|Citium]], which was the birthplace of [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]. Larnaca is home to the country's primary airport, [[Larnaca International Airport]]. It also has a seaport and a marina.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word Larnaca derives from the Greek n. ''[[larnax]]'', meaning: \"coffer\", \"box\", \"chest\", e.g. for household stores,  \"cinerary urn\", \"sarcophagus\" or \"coffin\"; \"drinking trough\" and \"chalice\". An informal etymology, attributes the origin of the name to ([[sarcophagi]]) that were found in the area.<ref>\"The great number sarcophagoi (larnakes) found at Larnaca may have given to the modern city its name.\" Excerpt of wall mounted text at [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca District Museum]], under the title \"Kition: The necropolis\"</ref> Sophocles Hadjisavvas, a state archeologist, states that \"[the city's U.S.] consul of the last quarter of the 19th century, claimed to have explored more than 3,000 tombs in the area of Larnaca, so-called after the immense number of sarcophagi found in the modern town\".<ref>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111945/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> In the vernacular, Larnaca is also known as '''Scala''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1}} {{IPA-el|\u02c8skala|}} from the word ({{lang-el|\u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1}} {{IPA-el|\u02c8skala|}} a loanword from the Italian {{lang|it|scala}}). During the Middle Ages, until the end of the 18th century, a small port-anchorage close to Larnaca Bay refers to maps, engravings, travel descriptions and documents as '''Scala di Saline''' and may account for this second name; (other names that appear in maps are include: Porto delle Salines, Rada delle Saline,  Ponta delle Saline, Punta delle Salino, Golfo delle Saline, Port Salines, Selines, Salines, Le Seline, Le Salline, Saline, Salin, Salinas, Arnicho di Salinas, Port of Lazarus, Lazare [o], Marine, Marina, Commercio [customs]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Street in Larnaca, Cyprus.

Around 1000 BC, Kition was rebuilt by [[Phoenicians]] and it subsequently became a center of Phoenician culture. The remains of the sites include [[cyclopean wall]]s and a complex of five temples and a [[naval]] port.\n\nIt was conquered in the first millennium BC by a series of great powers of the region. First by the [[Assyrian Empire]], then by Egypt. Like most Cypriot cities, Kition belonged to the Persian or [[Achaemenid Empire]]. In 450 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] general [[Cimon]] died at sea, while militarily supporting the revolt against Persia's rule over Cyprus. On his deathbed, he urged his officers to conceal his death from both their allies and the Persians.\n\nStrong<ref name=Guidebook18>{{cite book|last= Flourentzos |first=P.| title= A Guide to the Larnaca District Museum |year=1996 |publisher= Ministry of Communications and Works \u2013 Department of Antiquities|isbn=978-9963-36-425-1 |page=18}}</ref> earthquakes hit the city in 76 AD and the year after.\n\nEarthquakes of 322 AD and 342 \"caused the destruction not only of Kition but also of Salamis and Pafos\".<ref name=Guidebook18/> Kition's harbor silted up, and the population moved to the seafront farther south, sometime after this.

It is sometimes described as a [[mediterranean climate]], but its winter rainfall is below the required amount to avoid the semi-arid classification.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Larnaca (extremes 1881\u2013present)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 22.6\n|Feb record high C = 26.2\n|Mar record high C = 30.3\n|Apr record high C = 34.1\n|May record high C = 38.3\n|Jun record high C = 40.1\n|Jul record high C = 41.1\n|Aug record high C = 40.9\n|Sep record high C = 39.7\n|Oct record high C = 34.8\n|Nov record high C = 31.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.6\n|year record high C = 41.1\n|Jan high C = 16.8\n|Feb high C = 16.8\n|Mar high C = 19.1\n|Apr high C = 22.5\n|May high C = 26.5\n|Jun high C = 30.3\n|Jul high C = 32.4\n|Aug high C = 32.7\n|Sep high C = 30.9\n|Oct high C = 28.1\n|Nov high C = 22.6\n|Dec high C = 18.3\n|year high C = 24.7\n|Jan mean C = 12.1\n|Feb mean C = 11.8\n|Mar mean C = 13.9\n|Apr mean C = 17.1\n|May mean C = 21.2\n|Jun mean C = 25.0\n|Jul mean C = 27.3\n|Aug mean C = 27.6\n|Sep mean C = 25.4\n|Oct mean C = 22.6\n|Nov mean C = 17.5\n|Dec mean C = 13.7\n|year mean C = 19.6\n|Jan low C = 7.5\n|Feb low C = 6.9\n|Mar low C = 8.7\n|Apr low C = 11.7\n|May low C = 16.0\n|Jun low C = 19.8\n|Jul low C = 22.2\n|Aug low C = 22.6\n|Sep low C = 19.9\n|Oct low C = 17.1\n|Nov low C = 12.5\n|Dec low C = 9.2\n|year low C = 14.5\n|Jan record low C = -0.9\n|Feb record low C = -1.3\n|Mar record low C = -1.0\n|Apr record low C = 2.0\n|May record low C = 8.5\n|Jun record low C = 12.5\n|Jul record low C = 16.0\n|Aug record low C = 15.6\n|Sep record low C = 12.4\n|Oct record low C = 7.6\n|Nov record low C = 1.9\n|Dec record low C = 0.6\n|year record low C = -1.3\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 40.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 34.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 17.7\n|May precipitation mm =  8.8\n|Jun precipitation mm =  2.7\n|Jul precipitation mm =  0.6\n|Aug precipitation mm =  0.4\n|Sep precipitation mm =  7.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 13.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 53.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 94.5\n|year precipitation mm = 351.5\n|Jan precipitation days = 7.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.5\n|Apr precipitation days = 3.1\n|May precipitation days = 0.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 0.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.1\n|Aug precipitation days = 0.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 0.5\n|Oct precipitation days = 2.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.0\n|year precipitation days = 37.6\n|unit precipitation days = 1&nbsp;mm\n|Jan sun = 195.3\n|Feb sun = 208.8\n|Mar sun = 238.7\n|Apr sun = 267.0\n|May sun = 331.7\n|Jun sun = 378.0\n|Jul sun = 387.5\n|Aug sun = 365.8\n|Sep sun = 312.0\n|Oct sun = 275.9\n[[thumb]]\n|Nov sun = 216.0\n|Dec sun = 179.8\n|year sun = 3356.5\n|source 1 = Meteorological Service (Cyprus)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/MS/MS.nsf/DMLclimet_reports_en/DMLclimet_reports_en?OpenDocument&Start=1&Count=1000&Expand=1\n|title=Meteorological Service \u2013 Climatological and Meteorological Reports\n|accessdate=}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/station-720-Larnaca.php\n| title = Station Maceio\n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n|language = French \n| accessdate = 17 December 2018}}</ref>\n|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n{{wide image|Larnaca banner.jpg|900px|Panoramic view of Phoinikoudes beach}}\n\nThe city's landmarks include: the [[Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca|Church of Saint Lazarus]]; the [[Catacomb of Phaneromeni Church]]; [[Hala Sultan Tekke]]; the [[Bekir Pasha Aqueduct|Kamares Aqueduct]]; and the [[Larnaca Castle|Fort of Larnaca]].\n\nSo-called \"Foinikoudes\" is the [[esplanade|promenade]] along Athenon Avenue on the seafront.

A \u20ac650m upgrade of Larnaca Airport has been completed.\n\nThe service sector, including tourism, employs three-quarters of Larnaca's labour force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Many travel and tour operators and other travel-related companies have a head office Larnaca.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:The Cornaro art institute.JPG|thumb|The former Cornaro Institute in Larnaca was an art school and cultural centre prior to its closure by the municipality in 2017]]\nThere are over a hundred educational institutions in the city,{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} including the [[American Academy of Larnaca|American Academy]], [[Larnaca Armenian school|Larnaca Nareg Armenian school]] and the Alexander College.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Arts===\nLarnaca has a theatre and an art gallery, which are operated by the municipality.

Mackenzie Beach hosts windsurfing centre together with an extreme sports centre.\n\n===Festivals===\nMuch of the activity is centered on the city promenade during the major festivals. The most important of these is ''[[Deluge (mythology)|Kataklysmos]]'' or the ''Festival of the Flood'', celebrated in early summer with a series of cultural events. The festival used to last for about a week, but, in recent years, with the increased commercialism of peripheral stalls, rides and temporary [[Lokma|Loukoumades]] restaurants, the festival has been extended to about three weeks, during which the seafront is closed to traffic in the evenings.\n\n===Museums===\nMuseums found in Larnaca include the [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum]], [[Pierides Museum (Larnaca)|Pierides Museum]], Agios Lazaros Byzantine Museum, Kallinikeio Municipal Museum of Athienou, Larnaca Medieval Museum, Larnaca Municipal Museum of Natural History, Larnaca Municipal Historical Archives - Museum of Larnaca, Folklore Museum \u2018Kostas Kaimakliotis\u2019 - Aradippou, Theasis Museum and [[Kyriazis Medical Museum]].\n\n===Cuisine===\nThe beaches of Larnaca are lined with nearly identical seafood restaurants catering to tourists. Although there are many continental and international restaurants in Larnaca, visitors do not miss out on indulging in the local food. Many of the staple dishes involve beans, such as ''fasolaki'' ([[French beans]] cooked in red wine with lamb), and ''louvi me lahana'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s with [[chard]]).\nSome of the standard appetizers are potato salad, kohlrabi salad, and hot grilled black olives.\nThe next course may include [[Cyprus village sausage]] and [[sheftalia]], [[dolmades]] and [[kefte]]des, [[kolokassi]] in tomato sauce, and several aubergine-based dishes. Baked or grilled lamb (''[[souvla]]'') usually appears somewhere in the course of dining, as does some kind of fish.\n\n==Neighborhoods==\nLarnaca's neighborhoods include [[Skala (neighborhood in Larnaca)|Skala]], [[Prodromos (neighborhood in Larnaca)|Prodromos]], Faneromeni, Drosia, Kamares, Vergina and Agioi Anargyroi.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Larnaka International Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Larnaca International Airport]]]]\n\nThe city's [[transport hub]]s are [[Larnaca International Airport]] and [[Larnaca Port]]\u2014the Republic's busiest [[airport]] and second busiest port.\n\n===Public transport===\nPublic transport in Larnaca is served only by buses.
