The {{convert|1.7|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate consists of a {{frac|1|1|2}}-story main building flanked by slightly smaller ells. The {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} walls are constructed of quartz fieldstone quarried from the property and the mansion is covered with a grey gambrel roof.<ref name=\"dhr.virginia.gov\" /> The estate was purchased by Liberty University in the late 1970s to function as the headquarters of the university administration, housing the main office of university founder Jerry Falwell. One of the many reasons for the estate's continued fame is that Falwell died at his desk at the Carter Glass Mansion on May 15, 2007; his office has been preserved in the same condition ever since. Falwell and his wife were buried on the rear lawn of the mansion and a memorial to Falwell was placed there, overlooking the rest of the campus. The estate now serves mainly as a tourist site for the historically restored mansion as well as the Falwell office, while the upstairs section of the mansion has been converted to a bed and breakfast for Liberty University guests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2008/may/15/falwells_family_preserving_his_office_at_carter_gl-ar-224228/ |title=Falwell's family preserving his

Most of Liberty University's revenue came from taxpayer-funded sources. ProPublica/New York Times reported that each of the university's 300 salespeople were pressured to enroll up to eight students per day. A division of 60 sales people targeted members of the military specifically because they had greater access to federal tuition assistance. The university's salespeople were instructed to make the university appear more affordable by describing the tuition costs per credits rather than per course. The salespeople were also instructed to not inform potential students of the Christian orientation of the education; the first classes include three required Bible-studies classes.

Most of Liberty University's revenue came from taxpayer-funded sources. ProPublica/New York Times reported that each of the university's 300 salespeople were pressured to enroll up to eight students per day. A division of 60 sales people targeted members of the military specifically because they had greater access to federal tuition assistance. The university's salespeople were instructed to make the university appear more affordable by describing the tuition costs per credits rather than per course. The salespeople were also instructed to not inform potential students of the Christian orientation of the education; the first classes include three required Bible-studies classes. The credits for the Bible-studies classes are usually not transferable to other universities, which disincentivizes students from leaving Liberty University for other universities. According to a former employee, the university accepts any student with a grade point average above 0.5 (equivalent to a D-minus).<ref name=\"MacGillis\" />\n\n==== Sponsorships ====\nLiberty University has sponsored [[NASCAR]] driver [[William Byron (racing driver)|William Byron]], also a LU student, since 2014 in a late model program run by [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]'s [[JR Motorsports]].<ref name=JRM-WByronLateModel-2014>{{cite web|author1=Press Release|title=JRM Adds William Byron to Late Model Program for 2014|url=http://www.jrmracing.com/media/2014/01/17/jrm-adds-william-byron-to-late-model-program-for-2014|website=[[JR Motorsports|jrmracing.com]]|publisher=[[JR Motorsports]]|accessdate=1 July 2015|location=[[Mooresville, North Carolina]]|date=January 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703180736/http://www.jrmracing.com/media/2014/01/17/jrm-adds-william-byron-to-late-model-program-for-2014|archive-date=July 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Liberty is in the midst of a two-year deal with Byron and [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] team [[Hendrick Motorsports]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/08/30/liberty-university-set-to-support-william-byrons-24-through-2019/|title=William Byron sponsorship: Liberty, Hendrick ink two-year deal &#124; NASCAR.com|date=August 30, 2017|website=Official Site Of NASCAR|access-date=July 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703174953/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/08/30/liberty-university-set-to-support-william-byrons-24-through-2019/|archive-date=July 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Federal funding ===\nIn 2010,  students received about $445 million in federal financial aid money in 2010, the highest total of any school in Virginia and one of the highest in the country.<ref name=\"tops\">{{Cite news|url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2011/mar/27/liberty-tops-state-federal-aid-its-students-ar-929147/?referer=None&shorturl=http://newsadvance.com/ar/929147/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110814054227/http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2011/mar/27/liberty-tops-state-federal-aid-its-students-ar-929147/?referer=None&shorturl=http://newsadvance.com/ar/929147/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 14, 2011|title=Liberty tops state in federal aid for its students|last=Barry|first=Liz|date=March 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The News & Advance]]|accessdate=March 28, 2011|location=Lynchburg, Virginia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.ASP|title=Fall Headcount Enrollment|publisher=Research.schev.edu|accessdate=July 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722235554/http://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.asp|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The total, a 56 percent increase over the prior year, was mostly in the form of student loans, but also included some grants and other forms of aid.<ref name=\"tops\" /> Campus officials estimated the total received in 2013 at $775 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/14/liberty-university/2764789/|title=Jerry Falwell's legacy: A thriving Liberty University|last=Marklein|first=Mary Beth|date=September 14, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2013|publisher=Religion News Service from USA Today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006015006/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/14/liberty-university/2764789/|archive-date=October 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, Liberty University blocked campus access to a local Lynchburg newspaper, the ''News & Advocate'', after the newspaper reported on the school's dependence on federal financial aid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/campus-overload/post/falwells-liberty-university-blocks-newspaper-web-site/2011/04/13/AFLYNJXD_blog.html|title=Falwell's Liberty University blocks campus access to newspaper Web site|last=Johnson|first=Jenna|date=2011-04-13|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2018-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424202926/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/campus-overload/post/falwells-liberty-university-blocks-newspaper-web-site/2011/04/13/AFLYNJXD_blog.html|archive-date=April 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Falwell Jr. said that the decision to block the newspaper was unrelated to content published in the paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/liberty-u-is-said-to-block-campus-access-to-local-newspapers-web-site/32043|title=Liberty U.
