The name refers to its historic position as \"[[bank (geography)|The East Bank]]\" of the [[Huangpu River]], which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the '''Pudong New Area''', a [[new areas|state-level new area]] which extends all the way to the [[East China Sea]].\n\nThe traditional area of Pudong is now home to the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], and the [[Shanghai Tower]]. These modern skyscrapers directly face [[Puxi]]'s historic [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]], a remnant of former [[concessions in China|foreign concessions]] in China. The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], [[Nanhui New City]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].\n\n==History==\n''Pudong''&mdash;literally \"The East Bank of the Huangpu River\"&mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.\n\nIn 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China.  Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the [[supertall]] Jin Mao Building ({{convert|420.5|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Shanghai World Financial Center ({{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Shanghai Tower ({{convert|632|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the world's first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings&mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].\n\nPudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].\n\n==Government==\n[[District of China|Districts]] of the [[direct-controlled municipality]] of Shanghai are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].\n\nOn April 27, 2015, People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:\u4e0a\u6d77\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u59274\u500d \u5c06\u4e0e\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a\u5408\u7f72\u529e\u516c |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPudong literally means \"East Bank\". Pudong is bounded by the [[Huangpu River]] in the west and the [[East China Sea]] in the east. Pudong is distinguished from [[Puxi]] (\"West Bank\"), the older part of [[Shanghai]]. It has an area of {{convert|1210.4|km2}} and according to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], a population of 5,044,430 inhabitants, 1.9 million more than in 2000. Currently, at least 2.1 million of residents of Pudong are newcomers from other provinces or cities in China.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} China Statistical Office.

According to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], it has 5,044,430 people in 1,814,802 families, around 1/4 of Shanghai's total population, an explosive growth since the last census thanks to immigrants.<ref name=\"10thcencus\">Summary of Pudong Data from the Sixth National Population Census http://gov.pudong.gov.cn/pudongNews_inform/Info/Detail_365360.htm</ref> Pudong's resident population growth is well above national average because it is a popular immigration destination.

About 3/4 of the population live in the northern part and part of city center called \"Northern Territory\". 1/4 live in the \"Southern Territory\" that was the Nanhui District. The Northern Territory has a 6,667 population density, while the Southern Territory has 1,732/km<sup>2</sup>. Suburbs saw a greater increase in population during 2000-2010 with the help of the city's suburb expansion policy. Some counties in the traditional city center saw a population decrease.\n\n==Subdistricts and towns==\n{{further|List of township-level divisions of Shanghai}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name !!

[[Shanghai]] located east of the [[Huangpu River]] across from the historic city center of Shanghai in [[Puxi]]. The name refers to its historic position as \"[[bank (geography)|The East Bank]]\" of the [[Huangpu River]], which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the '''Pudong New Area''', a [[new areas|state-level new area]] which extends all the way to the [[East China Sea]].\n\nThe traditional area of Pudong is now home to the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], and the [[Shanghai Tower]]. These modern skyscrapers directly face [[Puxi]]'s historic [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]], a remnant of former [[concessions in China|foreign concessions]] in China. The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], [[Nanhui New City]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].\n\n==History==\n''Pudong''&mdash;literally \"The East Bank of the Huangpu River\"&mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.\n\nIn 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China.  Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the [[supertall]] Jin Mao Building ({{convert|420.5|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Shanghai World Financial Center ({{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Shanghai Tower ({{convert|632|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the world's first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings&mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].\n\nPudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].\n\n==Government==\n[[District of China|Districts]] of the [[direct-controlled municipality]] of Shanghai are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].\n\nOn April 27, 2015, People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:\u4e0a\u6d77\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u59274\u500d \u5c06\u4e0e\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a\u5408\u7f72\u529e\u516c |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPudong literally means \"East Bank\".
