[[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\n\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].\n\n[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.\n\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was \"Simba \u2013 It Cures the African Thirst.\"\n\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\n\n====BreakMate====\n{{Main|BreakMate}}\n\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people,<ref>{{cite news |title=Coca-Cola seeping into coffee breaks |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |publisher=Eugene Register-Guard |date=November 19, 1988 |access-date=March 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403174211/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO<sub>2</sub> tank.

These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestl\u00e9]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\n\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='\u2019[[The Guardian]]'\u2019 |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France.

The Coca-Cola Company has been faced with multiple lawsuits concerning these various criticisms.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:'96-'02 Chevrolet Express Wagon Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Chevrolet Express]] van bearing the logo of The Coca-Cola Company.]]\nCoca-Cola advertising has \"been among the most prolific in marketing history\", with a notable and major impact on popular culture and society as a whole.\n\nThe logo, bottle design, and brand image are internationally recognizable. Their product is ranked the number one soft drink, repeatedly, internationally, and has notoriety as the first soft drink consumed by astronauts in space. Coca-Cola employs a diverse range of integrated marketing communications to advertise through direct marketing, web based media, social media, and sales promotions (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author=Stringer, G. |date=2015|title= Case Study: Coca Cola Integrated Marketing Communications|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-study-coca-cola-integrated-marketing-gregory-stringer}}\n</ref>\n\nThe company carefully considers all touch points a consumer (or prospective consumer) has with the brand as potential delivery channels for the brand's message, and makes use of all relevant communication systems. This well established, long-standing, consistent approach has created a longing for the product that by far \"superseded the desire for that typically associated with a drink to quench one's thirst\" (Dudovskiy, 2015).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dudovskiy, J.|year=2015|title=Coca-Cola Marketing Communications: A Critical Analysis|accessdate=March 1, 2015|website=Research Methodology|url=http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221114805/http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;Direct marketing\nThey have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and [[restaurants]] only serving Coca-Cola over [[Pepsi]]. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, for example, [[baseball field]]s.\n\n;Viral marketing\nThe company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Web and social media\nThey set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary.

The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, Columbia released many popular films including ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and some others.

Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. [[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\n\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].\n\n[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.\n\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was \"Simba \u2013 It Cures the African Thirst.\"\n\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\n\n====BreakMate====\n{{Main|BreakMate}}\n\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988.

These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestl\u00e9]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\n\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='\u2019[[The Guardian]]'\u2019 |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France.
