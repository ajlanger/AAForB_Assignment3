He was elected MDC spokesman at the party Congress in June 2006. In April 2011 at the Party's congress in Bulawayo, he was elected as the Party's Organising secretary, a post that previously belonged to Elias Mudzuri. In Parliament, he  was chair  of the portfolio committees of Defence and Home Affairs, Public Accounts, Gender and Youth and Transport and Communications. Chamisa is also a member of the Local Government, Public Works & Urban Development and the African Caribbean and Pacific Parliament. He is a former secretary-general of the Zimbabwe National Students Union.\n\nIn March 2007 he was attacked at [[Harare International Airport]] as he attempted to leave the country for [[Belgium]]; he was admitted to a hospital with a broken skull. On the current situation in Zimbabwe, he said, \"There is no security. There is no protection.

''The Herald'' reported on 10 April 2009, that President [[Robert Mugabe]] had assigned responsibility for telecommunications to the Ministry of Transport, headed by [[Nicholas Goche]].<ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=84&art_id=nw20090410124717675C344831 \"Mugabe gives ally control of telecoms\"], Sapa-AFP (''IOL''), 10 April 2009.</ref> Chamisa and Tsvangirai objected to this decision, saying that Mugabe had no power to unilaterally assign telecommunications to another ministry under the terms of the power-sharing agreement.\n\nChamisa served as a cabinet minister from February 2009 to July 2013, until the end of the [[Government]] of national Unity. He also served as the Movement for Democratic Change's ([[MDC-T]]) organising secretary. He lost the position of party Secretary-General in the party's 2014 Congress to Douglas Mwonzora. Chamisa has been accused of barring other youth and student leaders from having closer access to party president Tsvangirai, a move allegedly meant to protect his position. After the expulsion of [[Tendai Biti]] and [[Elton Mangoma]], Chamisa's relationship with Morgan Tsvangirai deteriorated; he was apparently not well liked by Tsvangirai's loyalists. On 16 July 2016 Chamisa was appointed as co-Vice President of the MDC by Tsvangirai to serve alongside Mudzuri and Khupe.\n\nWhen party leader Morgan Tsvangirai began battling colon cancer, power struggles began to ensue in the party, mainly between the three Vice Presidents Chamisa, [[Elias Mudzuri]] and [[Thokozani Khupe]]. On 14 February 2018, it was announced that Tsvangirai had succumbed to colon cancer in the hospital and the next day, the Party's national council appointed Chamisa acting President for a period of 12 months effectively elbowing Mudzuri and Khupe out. As the new President of the MDC he also took over the role of Leader of the [[MDC Alliance]].\n\nOn 30 July 2018, Chamisa lost a disputed election to ZANU PF's [[Emmerson Mnangagwa|Mnangagwa]]. The election has been widely criticized for lacking credibility and being unfair.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Chamisa challenged the election results in Zimbabwe's constitutional court but his challenge was dismissed with cost. After the failure to convince the Constitutional Court, Chamisa questioned the independence of the judiciary and has since promised his supporters a strategy to regain stolen electoral victory.<ref>[https://www.thehararetimes.com/what-next-for-nelson-chamisa]</ref>\n\nChamisa claims ZANU-PF lost elections.
