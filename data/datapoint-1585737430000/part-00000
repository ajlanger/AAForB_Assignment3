In a fateful decision, McGill decided to take most of the Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements coming from Melbourne. Rede's spies observed these actions. That night many of the miners went back to their own tents after the traditional Saturday night carousing, with the assumption that the Queen's military forces would not be sent to attack on the Sabbath (Sunday).

According to Blainey, \"It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\"\n\nThe report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The [[Miner's Licence|gold licences]] were then abolished, and replaced by an annual [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields. Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted.

The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Lalor\n |first       = Peter\n |authorlink  = Peter Lalor\n |title       = Peter Lalor's Narrative\n |work        = Eureka on Trial\n |publisher   = Public Record Office Victoria, (2003)\n |year        = 1855\n |url         = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |accessdate  = 21 February 2007\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409140744/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |archivedate = 9 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nLalor stood for [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|{{Notatypo|Ballaarat}}]] in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.\n\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\n\n==Political legacy==\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]].

Just days later on 16 August 1851, Lieutenant-Governor [[Charles La Trobe|Latrobe]] proclaimed in the Government Gazette crown rights for all mining proceeds and a licence fee of 30 shillings per month effective from 1 September 1851.<ref>[http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf Charles La Trobe, Victoria's Separation & Gold Tax \u2013 'turning a wild colonial country into a civilised one'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411072510/http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf |date=11 April 2013 }} Roy Morgan Research</ref>\n\nOn 26 August, a rally of 40\u201350 miners opposing the fee was held at Hiscock's gully \u2013 the first of many such protests in the colony.<ref name=\"Argus 30 Aug 1851\">GOLD.

The government hastily repealed its plans due to the reaction.\n\nNevertheless, the oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency causing general dissent among the diggers. In addition, Weston Bate noted that the Ballarat diggings were in strong opposition to the strict liquor licensing laws imposed by the government.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nChanges to the Goldfields Act in 1853 allowed licence searches to occur at any time which further incensed the diggers. In [[Bendigo]] in 1853, an [[Anti-Gold Licence Association]] was formed and the miners were apparently on the brink of an armed clash with authorities.

On 16 November 1854 Governor Hotham appointed a Royal Commission on the goldfields' problems and grievances.  However, Commissioner Rede, rather than hear miners' grievances, increased the police presence in the goldfields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne.

The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\"\n\nThe report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The [[Miner's Licence|gold licences]] were then abolished, and replaced by an annual [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields. Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted.

The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Lalor\n |first       = Peter\n |authorlink  = Peter Lalor\n |title       = Peter Lalor's Narrative\n |work        = Eureka on Trial\n |publisher   = Public Record Office Victoria, (2003)\n |year        = 1855\n |url         = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |accessdate  = 21 February 2007\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409140744/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |archivedate = 9 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nLalor stood for [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|{{Notatypo|Ballaarat}}]] in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.\n\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\n\n==Political legacy==\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]].
