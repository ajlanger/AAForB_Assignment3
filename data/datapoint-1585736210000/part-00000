The production also features [[Donald Crisp]], [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]], [[Barton MacLane]], [[C. Aubrey Smith]], and [[Sara Allgood]]. Its storyline is based on the [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[novella]] ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' written by Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and first published in 1886. There have been [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|many filmed adaptations of the novella]]. This movie was a remake of the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Oscar-winning 1931 version, starring Fredric March.]] \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Henry Jekyll ([[Spencer Tracy]]) believes good and evil exist in everyone. Experiments reveal his evil side, named Mr. Hyde. Experience teaches him how evil and violent Hyde can be: he rapes Ivy Pearson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who earlier expressed interest in Jekyll. Meanwhile, Jekyll is preparing to marry Beatrix Emery ([[Lana Turner]]). Over the course of the film, Hyde abuses Ivy. Feeling remorse over the treatment inflicted on Ivy by his \u201cmonstrous\u201d counterpart, Jekyll vows never to take the serum again, destroys the key to his lab, and sends money to Ivy anonymously. Ivy believes the money was sent by Hyde in order to trick her into believing she is now free. On the advice of a friend over her rattled nerves, she goes to Jekyll for comfort. Jekyll promises that Hyde will never hurt her again.\n\nOn the way to Emery's house for the announcement of his marriage to Beatrix, Jekyll transforms into Hyde without taking the serum. He goes over to Ivy's house, accuses her of meeting with Jekyll, and strangles her. He escapes back to his locked lab, only to recall that he no longer has the key. He fails to break into the front door of his place, so he hurries to his friend Dr. Lanyon ([[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]) for help. Lanyon is shocked to find out that both Jekyll and Hyde are the same person as Hyde drinks the antidote in his friend's presence. Jekyll decides to break off his engagement to Bea in order to keep his dark secret. She refuses to accept, her reaction triggering Jekyll to become Hyde and frighten Bea. Her father ([[Donald Crisp]]) responds to her scream, only to be beaten to death by Hyde.\n\nLanyon later discovers a piece of Jekyll's cane at the scene, and he realizes his friend is responsible for the murder. He then leads police to search Jekyll's lab, where they find Jekyll, who earlier, as Hyde, had strong-armed past his butler, Poole ([[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]]), to get to the antidote. Soon the cornered doctor starts transforming once again into Hyde as authorities question him in the lab. A struggle ensues and Lanyon shoots Hyde. As the monster dies, he reverts yet again and finally to Jekyll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Jekyll\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ivy Pearson\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Bea Emery\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Sir Charles Emery\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as John Lanyon\n* [[Barton MacLane]] as Sam Higgins\n* [[C.
