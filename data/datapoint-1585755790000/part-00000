Giridhari then informed the royal officers of Govinda's royal lineage, gaining their acceptance, to make his way to the throne.

Govinda, in delight, requested Dutta to live and spend the rest of his life in the Gour Kingdom. However Dutta wanted to return to Rarh. Not wanting to displease Govinda, Dutta gave his youngest son, Mahipati, to live in the kingdom. Dutta stayed for a while in Gour as Govinda's commander-in-chief.

[[Brahmins]] from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (possibly [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s), also migrated to Gour and gained some authority, being favoured by Govinda for their orthodoxism. These elitist Brahmins led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over by Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s, or ''untouchables'' of the lowest social status. The Brahmins which King Kesava Deva had welcomed from [[Central India]], were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen who were influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\n== Defeat ==\n[[File:Tea Garden in Malini chora Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|Mulnicherra, now the oldest tea garden in South Asia, is home to the Harong Hurong cave which Govinda supposedly retreated to.]]\n{{Main|Conquest of Gour}}\nThere was also a minority of Muslim families who migrated to Gour and Tungachal, following the short-lived [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Expedition]] in 1254 led by the Governor of Bengal, [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]].<ref name=stewart>{{cite book|title=The History of Bengal|first=Charles|last=Stewart|year=1813|location=[[London]]}}</ref> [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]], who lived in the village of Tultikar, sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's ''[[aqiqah]]'' or celebration of birth.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">{{cite book |last=Hussain |first= M Sahul |year=2014 |chapter= Burhanuddin (R) |chapter-url= http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Burhanuddin_(R)|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn, Gulzar Alam, killed, as well as having [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]]'s right hand cut off.<ref>EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N.

Giridhari then informed the royal officers of Govinda's royal lineage, gaining their acceptance, to make his way to the throne.

Govinda, in delight, requested Dutta to live and spend the rest of his life in the Gour Kingdom. However Dutta wanted to return to Rarh. Not wanting to displease Govinda, Dutta gave his youngest son, Mahipati, to live in the kingdom. Dutta stayed for a while in Gour as Govinda's commander-in-chief.

[[Brahmins]] from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (possibly [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s), also migrated to Gour and gained some authority, being favoured by Govinda for their orthodoxism. These elitist Brahmins led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over by Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s, or ''untouchables'' of the lowest social status. The Brahmins which King Kesava Deva had welcomed from [[Central India]], were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen who were influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\n== Defeat ==\n[[File:Tea Garden in Malini chora Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|Mulnicherra, now the oldest tea garden in South Asia, is home to the Harong Hurong cave which Govinda supposedly retreated to.]]\n{{Main|Conquest of Gour}}\nThere was also a minority of Muslim families who migrated to Gour and Tungachal, following the short-lived [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Expedition]] in 1254 led by the Governor of Bengal, [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]].<ref name=stewart>{{cite book|title=The History of Bengal|first=Charles|last=Stewart|year=1813|location=[[London]]}}</ref> [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]], who lived in the village of Tultikar, sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's ''[[aqiqah]]'' or celebration of birth.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">{{cite book |last=Hussain |first= M Sahul |year=2014 |chapter= Burhanuddin (R) |chapter-url= http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Burhanuddin_(R)|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn, Gulzar Alam, killed, as well as having [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]]'s right hand cut off.<ref>EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N.
