Other fossils were collected from a quarry in [[Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Franklin]], [[Milwaukee County]], owned and operated by Franklin Aggregate Inc. That quarry lies 32&nbsp;km south of the Quarry in Waukesha. The Franklin fossils were from blasted material apparently originating from a horizon and setting equivalent to that of the Waukesha site. Its biota is similar to that from the Waukesha site, except that it lacks [[trilobites]].<ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\n== Taphonomy ==\nThe Waukesha Biota is unusual in preserving few of the kinds of animals that typically dominate the Silurian fossil record, including in other strata of the same two quarries. Fossils of [[coral]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoan]]s, [[gastropod]]s, [[bivalve]]s, and [[cephalopods]] are rare or absent from the Waukesha Biota, although [[trilobite]]s are diverse and common.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\nThe exceptional preservation of non-biomineralized and lightly skeletonized remains of the Waukesha Biota is generally attributed to a combination of favorable conditions, including the transportation of the organisms to a sediment trap that was hostile to predators but favorable to the production of organic films that coated the surfaces of the dead organisms,  which inhibited decay, sometimes enhanced by promoting precipitation of a thin phosphatic coating, which is observed on many of the fossils.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name=JonesFeldman&Schweitzer2015/><ref name=Mooreetal2005>{{cite journal | title=A new synziphosurine (Chelicerata: Xiphosura) from the Late Llandovery (Silurian) Waukesha Lagerst\u00e4tte, Wisconsin, USA |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=242\u2013250 |year=2005 |last1=Moore |first1=R.A. |last2=Briggs |first2=D.E.G. |last3=Braddy |first3=S.J. |last4=Anderson |first4=L.I. |last5=Mikulic |first5=D.G. |last6=Kluessendorf |first6=J. |doi=10.1666/0022-3360(2005)079<0242:ANSCXF>2.0.CO;2 |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/article/new-synziphosurine-chelicerata-xiphosura-from-the-late-llandovery-silurian-waukesha-lagerstatte-wisconsin-usa/36E6A1726DB0352253758FE6A53910CA}}</ref><ref name=Wilsonetal2004>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=H.M. |last2=Briggs |first2=D.E.G. |last3=Mikulic |first3=D.G. |last4=Kluessendorf |first4=J.|title=Affinities of the Lower Silurian Waukesha 'Myriapod' |date=2004 |publisher=2004 annual meeting of the Geological Society of America  |location= |pages=}}</ref><ref name=Wendruffetal2020/><ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/><ref name=Jonesetal2015>{{cite journal | title=''Ceratiocaris'' from the Silurian Waukesha Biota, Wisconsin|journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=1007\u20131021 |year=2015 |last1=Jones |first1=W.T. |last2=Feldman |first2=R.M. |last3=Schweitzer |first3=C.E. |doi=10.1017/jpa.2016.22 }}</ref>\n\n== Biota ==\n=== Green algae ===\nCarbonized fossils of a noncalcified dasycladalean alga (''Heterocladus waukeshaensis'') have been found at the Waukesha site.<ref name=LoDucaetal2003>{{cite journal | title=A new noncalcified dasycladalean alga from the Silurian of Wisconsin |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=1152\u20131158 |year=2003 |last1=LoDuca |first1=S.T. |last2=Kluessendorf |first2=J. |last3=Mikulic |first3=D.G. |doi=10.1666/0022-3360(2003)077<1152:ANNDAF>2.0.CO;2 |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/article/new-noncalcified-dasycladalean-alga-from-the-silurian-of-wisconsin/CFF7D75337C24BEA67DC73ECE2A708AD}}</ref> \n\n=== Arthropods===\nThe fossil record of the Waukesha Biota is dominated by [[arthropod]]s, both in number of fossils and number of species.<ref name=Kluessendorf1994/>  This is even true when excluding [[trilobite]]s, which in most Early [[Paleozoic]] marine biotas are the source of the vast majority or all of the arthropod fossils.
