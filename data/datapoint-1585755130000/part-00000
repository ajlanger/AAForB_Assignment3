From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.

In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009.

From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.

In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009.
