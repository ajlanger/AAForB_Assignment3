Currently operating from offices in Nazareth and [[Kafr Qasim]], Saadi remains one of its two CEOs, along with Revital Duek, who replaced Paz Hirschmann in 2019. Tsofen's board, which is half Jewish and half Arab, and whose members include professionals with backgrounds in hi-tech, academia, and business, is chaired by Dr Ramzi Halabi, a former mayor of [[Daliyat al-Carmel]] and currently a lecturer at [[Tel Aviv University]].
