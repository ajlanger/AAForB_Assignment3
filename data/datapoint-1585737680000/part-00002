Chick flicks often are released ''[[en masse]]'' around [[Valentine's Day]].<ref name=suck/><ref name=click/> Feminists such as [[Gloria Steinem]] have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related genre term \"[[chick lit]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/jul/13/chick|title=Chick flicks or prick flicks, they're just films|first=Jenny|last=Colgan|date=13 July 2007|website=the Guardian}}</ref> and a film critic has called it derogatory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/entertainment/la-et-mg-safe-haven-premiere-julianne-hough-josh-duhamel-20130206|title='Safe Haven' premiere: Don't call it a 'chick flick,' please|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|date=6 February 2013|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n== Definitions ==\nGenerally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women.<ref name=click/> Defining a chick flick is, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' has stated, more of a parlor game than a science.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |date= April 9, 2008 |accessdate= October 4, 2010 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |title= Wary Hollywood Plans More Chick-Flicks (Hoping to Lure the Guys) |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/movies/09roma.html |first= Michael |last=Cieply }}</ref> These films are generally held in [[popular culture]] as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term \"problematic\" for implying \"frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism\", according to [[ReelzChannel]].<ref name=suck/> However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' received [[Academy Awards]] for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.<ref name=terms/> More recently, the film ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' (called a chick flick in some circles), featuring both [[Emma Stone]] and [[Ryan Gosling]], won Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.\n\nSome frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female [[protagonist]],<ref name=suck/> thematic use of the [[Pink|color pink]] (along with [[Pink#In culture|metaphorical allusions of the color]]),<ref name=click/> and romance and/or dating-based storylines.<ref name=twilight/> Longtime producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] has remarked about the plots, \"How do you cope with money and love?\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\nWomen are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings.  Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick.  However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.\n\nFemale [[MSN.com]] commentator Kim Morgan has written,\n{{quote|[C]inema just wouldn't be the same without movies for and about women.

Right... sisters or movies.<ref name=morgan />}}\n\n== History ==\nThe term \"chick flick\" was not widely used until the 1980s and 1990s but is reported to have been coined by Brian Callaghan of Montreal, Canada in the mid-1970s while discussing movies with a friend in a schoolyard. It has its roots in the \"[[Woman's film|women's pictures]]\" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the ''[[film noir]]'' of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Chick Flicks: Contemporary Women at the Movies|last = Ferriss|first = Suzanne and Mallory Young|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title= The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory?

[[Brandon French]] notes that the women's films of the 1950s \"shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title= On The Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties |last= French |first= Brandon |publisher= Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. |year= 1978 |isbn= 0804422206 |location= New York |pages= xxii-xxiii |url= https://archive.org/details/onvergeofrevoltw0000fren }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1961 in film|1961 film]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', commonly known as one of the \"classic\" films from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age of cinema]], is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with [[loneliness]], obsessive [[materialism]], and happy endings.<ref name=suck/><ref name=stylecaster/> Author [[Molly Haskell]] has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now \"sing a different tune.\" She feels that they are \"more defiant and upbeat, [[post-modern]] and [[post-feminist]].\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nIn the U.S. in the [[1980s in film|1980s]], a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.<ref name=suck/>\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\". He also said, \"they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about.\" According to [[Fandango.com]], more than 75% of ''Twilight''{{'s}} opening-weekend audience was female.<ref name=\"twilight\" />\n\n==Criticism of the term ==\nThe term ''chick flick'' has generated several negative responses from the modern [[Feminist movement|feminist]] community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of ''The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?'', Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are \"an attempt to lump together an entire gender\u2019s interests into one genre.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Stereotypes And The Logic Of Social Relations|last = Rimashevskaia|first = Natal'ia|date = 2008|journal = Russian Social Science Review|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 35\u201348|doi = 10.1080/10611428.2008.11065289|pmid = }}</ref> There is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that [[gender stereotypes]] further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their \"human and intellectual potential.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nMore criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are [[Microaggressions|micro-aggressions]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = SAGE Reference - Encyclopedia of Human Services and Diversity |url= http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-human-services-and-diversity|doi = 10.4135/9781483346663|isbn= 9781452287485|first = Linwood|last = Cousins|year= 2014}}</ref> Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a \"race, gender, age, and ability.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Critique of the genre ==\nDespite the genre's popular successes, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common. Although the subcategories represent different plot lines, all five{{Which|date=January 2019}} have several characteristics in common.

''Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick'', Diane Negra focuses on several romantic comedies, deemed to be chick flicks, set in [[New York City]] after the

Chick flicks often are released ''[[en masse]]'' around [[Valentine's Day]].<ref name=suck/><ref name=click/> Feminists such as [[Gloria Steinem]] have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related genre term \"[[chick lit]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/jul/13/chick|title=Chick flicks or prick flicks, they're just films|first=Jenny|last=Colgan|date=13 July 2007|website=the Guardian}}</ref> and a film critic has called it derogatory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/entertainment/la-et-mg-safe-haven-premiere-julianne-hough-josh-duhamel-20130206|title='Safe Haven' premiere: Don't call it a 'chick flick,' please|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|date=6 February 2013|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n== Definitions ==\nGenerally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women.<ref name=click/> Defining a chick flick is, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' has stated, more of a parlor game than a science.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |date= April 9, 2008 |accessdate= October 4, 2010 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |title= Wary Hollywood Plans More Chick-Flicks (Hoping to Lure the Guys) |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/movies/09roma.html |first= Michael |last=Cieply }}</ref> These films are generally held in [[popular culture]] as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term \"problematic\" for implying \"frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism\", according to [[ReelzChannel]].<ref name=suck/> However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' received [[Academy Awards]] for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.<ref name=terms/> More recently, the film ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' (called a chick flick in some circles), featuring both [[Emma Stone]] and [[Ryan Gosling]], won Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.\n\nSome frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female [[protagonist]],<ref name=suck/> thematic use of the [[Pink|color pink]] (along with [[Pink#In culture|metaphorical allusions of the color]]),<ref name=click/> and romance and/or dating-based storylines.<ref name=twilight/> Longtime producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] has remarked about the plots, \"How do you cope with money and love?\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\nWomen are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings.  Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick.  However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.\n\nFemale [[MSN.com]] commentator Kim Morgan has written,\n{{quote|[C]inema just wouldn't be the same without movies for and about women.

It has its roots in the \"[[Woman's film|women's pictures]]\" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the ''[[film noir]]'' of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Chick Flicks: Contemporary Women at the Movies|last = Ferriss|first = Suzanne and Mallory Young|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title= The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory?

[[Brandon French]] notes that the women's films of the 1950s \"shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title= On The Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties |last= French |first= Brandon |publisher= Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. |year= 1978 |isbn= 0804422206 |location= New York |pages= xxii-xxiii |url= https://archive.org/details/onvergeofrevoltw0000fren }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1961 in film|1961 film]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', commonly known as one of the \"classic\" films from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age of cinema]], is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with [[loneliness]], obsessive [[materialism]], and happy endings.<ref name=suck/><ref name=stylecaster/> Author [[Molly Haskell]] has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now \"sing a different tune.\" She feels that they are \"more defiant and upbeat, [[post-modern]] and [[post-feminist]].\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nIn the U.S. in the [[1980s in film|1980s]], a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.<ref name=suck/>\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\". He also said, \"they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about.\" According to [[Fandango.com]], more than 75% of ''Twilight''{{'s}} opening-weekend audience was female.<ref name=\"twilight\" />\n\n==Criticism of the term ==\nThe term ''chick flick'' has generated several negative responses from the modern [[Feminist movement|feminist]] community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of ''The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?'', Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are \"an attempt to lump together an entire gender\u2019s interests into one genre.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Stereotypes And The Logic Of Social Relations|last = Rimashevskaia|first = Natal'ia|date = 2008|journal = Russian Social Science Review|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 35\u201348|doi = 10.1080/10611428.2008.11065289|pmid = }}</ref> There is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that [[gender stereotypes]] further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their \"human and intellectual potential.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nMore criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women.
