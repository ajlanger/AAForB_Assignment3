In 1615, Frederick became involved in a war with the City of [[Brunswick (city)|Brunswick]], which was reluctant to recognize his overlordship.\n\nBetween 1616 and 1622, he was de facto deposed by his mother, [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick|Elizabeth]], with the help of her brother, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], because of his [[alcoholism]]; government business was led by [[Anton von Streithorst]], who nearly ruined the state by minting coins from cheap metals and thus causing [[inflation]].
