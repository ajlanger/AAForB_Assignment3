In the early 16th century abuses (such as selling [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church) occasioned much discontent, and a general desire for reform emerged.  In 1517 the Reformation began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] detailing 95 assertions which Luther believed showed corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  The Reformation demonstrated Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy used and abused power, and with the very idea of a papacy. In 1521 the [[Diet of Worms]] outlawed Luther, but the Reformation spread rapidly.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>  Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the modern German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible translation, his dialect evolved into what is now standard modern German.\n\nWith the [[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]] of the Lutheran princes at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Second Diet of Speyer|Speyer]] (1529) and rejection of the Lutheran \"Augsburg Confession\" at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1530), a separate Lutheran church emerged.<ref name=\":2\">Robert Kolb, ''Confessing the faith: reformers define the Church, 1530\u20131580'' (Concordia Publishing House, 1991)</ref>\n\nFrom 1545 the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] began in Germany. Much of its impetus came from the newly founded (in 1540) [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]]. It restored Catholicism to many areas, including Bavaria.<ref>Marvin R. O'Connell, ''Counter-reformation, 1559\u20131610'' (1974)</ref> The Holy Roman Empire became religiously diverse; for the most part, the states of northern and central Germany became Protestant (chiefly Lutheran, but also Calvinist/Reformed) while the states of southern Germany and the [[Rhineland]] largely remained Catholic. In 1547 the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], an alliance of Protestant rulers.  The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler (''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'').<ref>Lewis W.

There was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to [[Lutheranism#Church fellowship|unify]] the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardised liturgy, organisation, and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralised royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognised as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"[[Old Lutherans]]\" in Prussia and Silesia who followed the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground.  Tens of thousands migrated [[German Australian|to South Australia]] and the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]]. Finally, in 1845 the new king, [[Frederick William IV]], offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form separate [[Free church#Germany|free church]] associations with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004.

Opposing the rationalism of the late 18th century, there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion.  Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands.  However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n=== Kulturkampf and the German Empire (1871\u20131918) ===\n{{main|Kulturkampf}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|275px|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts Pope Pius IX, 1875]]\n[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|275px|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895.

He launched a [[Kulturkampf]] (\"culture war\") against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy.  The Catholic element, in turn, saw the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberals]], who often happened to be Protestant, as its worst enemy and formed the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]].<ref>Douglas W.

Nearly all Catholic bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant facing the increasingly heavy penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government.  Historian Anthony Steinhoff reports the casualty totals:\n\n<blockquote>As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile. ...Finally, between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies.<ref>Anthony J.

The predominantly secularised states, such as [[Hamburg]] or the East German states, used to be Lutheran or [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] strongholds.

In the early 16th century abuses (such as selling [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church) occasioned much discontent, and a general desire for reform emerged.  In 1517 the Reformation began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] detailing 95 assertions which Luther believed showed corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  The Reformation demonstrated Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy used and abused power, and with the very idea of a papacy. In 1521 the [[Diet of Worms]] outlawed Luther, but the Reformation spread rapidly.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>  Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the modern German language.

There was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to [[Lutheranism#Church fellowship|unify]] the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardised liturgy, organisation, and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralised royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognised as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"[[Old Lutherans]]\" in Prussia and Silesia who followed the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground.  Tens of thousands migrated [[German Australian|to South Australia]] and the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]]. Finally, in 1845 the new king, [[Frederick William IV]], offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form separate [[Free church#Germany|free church]] associations with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 412-19</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985-1004.

Opposing the rationalism of the late 18th century, there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion.  Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 419-21</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837-38 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands.  However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648-1840'' (1964) pp 498-509</ref>\n\n=== Kulturkampf and the German Empire (1871\u20131918) ===\n{{main|Kulturkampf}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|275px|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts Pope Pius IX, 1875]]\n[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|275px|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895.

He launched a [[Kulturkampf]] (\"culture war\") against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy.  The Catholic element, in turn, saw the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberals]], who often happened to be Protestant, as its worst enemy and formed the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]].<ref>Douglas W.

Jews were likewise heavily discriminated against.<ref>John C.G. Roehl, \"Higher civil servants in Germany, 1890-1900\" in James J.

Nearly all Catholic bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant facing the increasingly heavy penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government.  Historian Anthony Steinhoff reports the casualty totals:\n\n<blockquote>As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile. ...Finally, between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies.<ref>Anthony J.
