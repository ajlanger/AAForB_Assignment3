Most of the storms formed either in the [[Mozambique Channel]] or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent [[1998\u201399 Australian region cyclone season|Australian basin]] east of 90\u00b0&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]]. As a result, few storms impacted [[Madagascar]], and none made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal [[sea surface temperature]]s in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, [[R\u00e9union]] island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on R\u00e9union. There were only two tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of at least 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\nActivity began late, with the first tropical storm &ndash; Alda &ndash; forming on January&nbsp;16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]], which was one of few favorable areas for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on R\u00e9union and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm &ndash; Evrina &ndash; peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90\u00b0E, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) in the basin. The final storm was unnamed, crossing from the Australian basin on April&nbsp;21 as a minimal tropical storm before quickly dissipating. There were also several tropical disturbances or depressions, many short-lived. The first of these formed on September&nbsp;3 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and there was a tropical depression in February in the Mozambique Channel that approached tropical storm status.\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/1998 till:01/06/1999\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/1998\n\nColors     =\n id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n id:GP  value:red\n id:DT  value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)  legend:Tropical_Disturbance_&lt;_50_km/h_(_&lt;_31_mph)\n id:TD  value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_51&ndash;62_km/h_(32&ndash;38_mph)\n id:MS  value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Moderate_tropical_Storm_=_63&ndash;88_km/h_(39&ndash;54_mph)\n id:SS  value:rgb(0.80,1,1)     legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89&ndash;117_km/h_(55&ndash;73_mph)\n id:TC  value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Tropical_Cyclone_=_118&ndash;165_km/h_(74&ndash;102_mph)\n id:IT  value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Intense_=_166&ndash;212_km/h_(103&ndash;132_mph)\n id:VI  value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Very_Intense_&gt;_212_km/h_(_&gt;_132_mph)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:20/07/1998 till:25/07/1998 color:TD text:\"H4\"\n  from:03/09/1998 till:06/09/1998 color:DT text:\"A1\"\n  from:29/09/1998 till:02/10/1998 color:DT text:\"A2\"\n  from:04/12/1998 till:04/12/1998 color:DT text:\"A3\"\n  from:03/01/1999 till:05/01/1999 color:DT text:\"A4\"\n  from:14/01/1999 till:19/01/1999 color:SS text:\"Alda\"\n  from:28/01/1999 till:02/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Damien-Birenda\"\n  barset:break\n  from:31/01/1999 till:04/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Chikita\"\n  from:11/02/1999 till:17/02/1999 color:TD text:\"D1\"\n  from:23/02/1999 till:06/03/1999 color:DT text:\"D2-E1\"\n  from:28/02/1999 till:20/03/1999 color:DT text:\"E2\"\n  from:02/03/1999 till:19/03/1999 color:IT text:\"Davina\"\n  from:11/03/1999 till:21/03/1999 color:TD text:\"E3\"\n  from:01/04/1999 till:10/04/1999 color:IT text:\"Frederic\u2013Evrina\"\n  barset:break\n  from:21/04/1999 till:24/04/1999 color:MS text:\"Hamish-F1\"\n bar:Month width:6 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/1998 till:01/08/1998 text:July\n  from:01/08/1998 till:01/09/1998 text:August\n  from:01/09/1998 till:01/10/1998 text:September\n  from:01/10/1998 till:01/11/1998 text:October\n  from:01/11/1998 till:01/12/1998 text:November\n  from:01/12/1998 till:01/01/1999 text:December\n  from:01/01/1999 till:01/02/1999 text:January\n  from:01/02/1999 till:01/03/1999 text:February\n  from:01/03/1999 till:01/04/1999 text:March\n  from:01/04/1999 till:01/05/1999 text:April\n  from:01/05/1999 till:01/06/1999 text:May\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on [[R\u00e9union]] island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin during the season.

In general, [[sea surface temperature]]s were below normal, and [[atmospheric pressure]]s were above normal, both unfavorable for [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. In the month of February, on average the peak time for activity, there was a general lack of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, east of Madagascar. The average monthly pressure on R\u00e9union was the highest since reliable records began in 1953. The low number of storms occurred despite an otherwise active cyclone year in the southern hemisphere. In its summary of the season, the MFR described the lack of activity as \"rare and remarkable\", possibly related to a [[Walker circulation]]. The agency monitored 14&nbsp;tropical disturbances, of which only eight were tropical depressions for at least 24&nbsp;hours. Six of these intensified into tropical storms, three less than the average of nine, of which only two attained tropical cyclone status, or half the average. There were 28&nbsp;days in which there was storm or tropical cyclone activity, less than the average of 42 and at the time the fourth lowest since reliable record-keeping began in 1967 with the advent of satellite imagery. The only seasons with a lower number of storm days were [[1982\u201383 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|1982\u201383]], [[1986\u201387 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|1986\u201387]], and [[1997\u201398 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|1997\u201398]].<ref name=\"report\">{{cite report|editor=Philippe Caroff|year=2000|work=RSMC La Reunion|publisher=[[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]]|title=Cyclone Season 1998-1999 in the South-West Indian Ocean|accessdate=2014-01-22|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index19981999.html}}</ref>\n\n==Systems==\n\n===Severe Tropical Storm Alda===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Track=Alda 1999 track.png\n|Image=Alda Jan 18 1999 0426Z.png\n|Formed=January 14\n|Dissipated=January 19\n|10-min winds=57\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=975\n}}\nAfter a subtropical depression exited the Mozambique Channel, another area of convection formed in the region on January&nbsp;8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days. A passing cold front increased convection further on January&nbsp;12, which split off a [[cold-core low|cutoff low-pressure area]].<ref name=\"report\"/> Two days later, a [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] disturbance formed offshore [[Beira, Mozambique]], classified due to the [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] origins and lack of centralized convection.<ref name=\"report\"/><ref name=\"jgp\"/> The system remained nearly stationary, with the convection extending well to the east.

At its peak on March&nbsp;31, Frederic developed a well-defined {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} eye within a circular central dense overcast. The MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph), and the JTWC estimated maximum 1-minute winds of 260&nbsp;km/h (160&nbsp;mph), equivalent to a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]]. Subsequently, Frederic encountered the combination of wind shear and cooler, dry air, which caused weakening.

By April&nbsp;2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30&nbsp;hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April&nbsp;5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects.

Based on the organization, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression on February&nbsp;13. Although there were gale-force winds in the southwest periphery, the circulation was located on the northern edge of the convection. The depression neared tropical storm intensity, but an increase in wind shear from a nearby trough prevented further intensification. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), making the system a tropical storm by their assessment.

Most of the storms formed either in the [[Mozambique Channel]] or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent [[1998\u201399 Australian region cyclone season|Australian basin]] east of 90\u00b0&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]]. As a result, few storms impacted [[Madagascar]], and none made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal [[sea surface temperature]]s in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, [[R\u00e9union]] island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on R\u00e9union. There were only two tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of at least 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\nActivity began late, with the first tropical storm &ndash; Alda &ndash; forming on January&nbsp;16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]], which was one of few favorable areas for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on R\u00e9union and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm &ndash; Evrina &ndash; peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90\u00b0E, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) in the basin.

Convection fluctuated daily but became more persistent on February&nbsp;11. That day, the thunderstorms organized into a circulation that had formed less than {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Beira, Mozambique, becoming Tropical Disturbance D1. After forming, the system moved southward, developing a central dense overcast with northeasterly [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]. Based on the organization, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression on February&nbsp;13. Although there were gale-force winds in the southwest periphery, the circulation was located on the northern edge of the convection. The depression neared tropical storm intensity, but an increase in wind shear from a nearby trough prevented further intensification. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), making the system a tropical storm by their assessment. A building ridge to the south turned the depression to the northeast, bringing the system near Europa Island. A station on the island recorded sustained winds of {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} with gusts to {{convert|104|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} about three hours before and after the closest approach; the observations suggested that the depression could have become a tropical storm. Soon thereafter, the associated convection dissipated and the circulation turned westward. After crossing over its former path, the depression dissipated on February&nbsp;17 very close to where it developed.<ref name=\"report\"/><ref>{{cite report|author=Kenneth R. Knapp|author2=Michael C.

On February&nbsp;20, a cold front exited the African coast off Mozambique, spawning an area of convection. A weak low pressure area developed on February&nbsp;23, which proceeded to move southeastward. Due to unfavorable wind shear, the system failed to organize much, although initially it produced strong wind gusts. On February&nbsp;28, much of the convection was removed from the circulation, which looped over southwestern Madagascar to turn back to the west.
