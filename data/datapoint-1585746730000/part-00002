The show has gone through several schedule changes through its lifetime, but as of 2019, airs weekly, Monday through Thursday. The first video with ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' included in its intro was uploaded on June 21, 2007. As DeFranco became increasingly popular, he signed with [[Revision3]], which would eventually acquire all of DeFranco's assets, including the ''PDS''. ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' has been sponsored by [[Netflix]], [[Ting (cell phone company)|Ting]], and [[State Farm]]. The show has been nominated for and has won several awards that focus on internet culture and web series. As of 2017 Philip DeFranco purchased his assets back from [[Group Nine Media|Group Nine]] (the company that replaced [[Discovery Digital Networks]]) and the Philip DeFranco show is now a part of the Philip DeFranco Network and produced by Rogue Rocket, DeFranco's production company.\n\n==Format==\nThe show is recorded by DeFranco in his production office in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]].<ref name=BTSLATimes/> The ''PDS'' is then edited by James Girardier so that the episode is presented in a fast paced vlog format, complemented with use of frequent jump cuts throughout.<ref name=BTSLATimes/><ref name=LATimes/><ref>{{cite news|last=Jaworski|first=Michelle|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/philip-defranco-shark-week-interview/|title=YouTube's Philip DeFranco braves dangerous new waters for Shark Week|work=The Daily Dot|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> The topics discussed in the show vary, but usually cover pop culture and news.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Humphrey|first=Michael|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2012/07/27/youtube-primetime-philip-defrancos-people-first-plan-has-sourcefed-booming/|title=YouTube PrimeTime: Philip DeFranco's 'People First' Plan Has SourceFed Booming|magazine=Forbes|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> Episodes usually have a 10-minute duration in which Defranco lists both arguments of a story and then states his opinion.<ref name=LATimes/> During the show's early existence, in 2007, DeFranco stated that he usually searches websites such as [[Technorati]] to find topics to discuss.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ratner|first=Andrew|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-09-23/news/0709220310_1_youtube-video-bloggers|title=For 1 college video blogger, it's a really strange trip|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Episodes of the series include recurring segments, such as the \"Douchebag of the Day\" segment and \"Today in Awesome.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Rayne|url=http://www.mindcryme.com/2009/08/21/sxephil-a-little-news-a-little-sarcasm-and-your-douchebag-of-the-day/|title=sxePhil: A Little News, A Little Sarcasm, and Your Douchebag of the Day|publisher=Mind Cryme|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of the older episodes have been noted to include racy thumbnails, such as ''Big Boobs and You''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sarno|first=David|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/entertainment/ca-webscout14|title=The bait is sexy; be prepared for a switch|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 14, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> As of June 2013, the video now holds a thumbnail of DeFranco speaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=big+boobs+and+you&oq=big+boobs+and+you&gs_l=youtube.3...1873918.1876215.0.1876296.17.17.0.0.0.0.203.1898.5j10j1.16.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.8xWrx1Hzeeo|title=''big boobs and you'' search query|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The video was chosen as one of DeFranco's top five YouTube moments by ''New Media Rockstars''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Klima|first=Jeff|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/01/phil-defranco-to-retire-the-top-5-phil-defranco-moments-on-youtube/|title=PHIL DEFRANCO TO RETIRE?

pop culture and news series created by American [[YouTube]] personality, [[Philip DeFranco]], and his main claim to fame. The show has gone through several schedule changes through its lifetime, but as of 2019, airs weekly, Monday through Thursday. The first video with ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' included in its intro was uploaded on June 21, 2007. As DeFranco became increasingly popular, he signed with [[Revision3]], which would eventually acquire all of DeFranco's assets, including the ''PDS''. ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' has been sponsored by [[Netflix]], [[Ting (cell phone company)|Ting]], and [[State Farm]]. The show has been nominated for and has won several awards that focus on internet culture and web series. As of 2017 Philip DeFranco purchased his assets back from [[Group Nine Media|Group Nine]] (the company that replaced [[Discovery Digital Networks]]) and the Philip DeFranco show is now a part of the Philip DeFranco Network and produced by Rogue Rocket, DeFranco's production company.\n\n==Format==\nThe show is recorded by DeFranco in his production office in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]].<ref name=BTSLATimes/> The ''PDS'' is then edited by James Girardier so that the episode is presented in a fast paced vlog format, complemented with use of frequent jump cuts throughout.<ref name=BTSLATimes/><ref name=LATimes/><ref>{{cite news|last=Jaworski|first=Michelle|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/philip-defranco-shark-week-interview/|title=YouTube's Philip DeFranco braves dangerous new waters for Shark Week|work=The Daily Dot|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> The topics discussed in the show vary, but usually cover pop culture and news.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Humphrey|first=Michael|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2012/07/27/youtube-primetime-philip-defrancos-people-first-plan-has-sourcefed-booming/|title=YouTube PrimeTime: Philip DeFranco's 'People First' Plan Has SourceFed Booming|magazine=Forbes|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> Episodes usually have a 10-minute duration in which Defranco lists both arguments of a story and then states his opinion.<ref name=LATimes/> During the show's early existence, in 2007, DeFranco stated that he usually searches websites such as [[Technorati]] to find topics to discuss.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ratner|first=Andrew|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-09-23/news/0709220310_1_youtube-video-bloggers|title=For 1 college video blogger, it's a really strange trip|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Episodes of the series include recurring segments, such as the \"Douchebag of the Day\" segment and \"Today in Awesome.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Rayne|url=http://www.mindcryme.com/2009/08/21/sxephil-a-little-news-a-little-sarcasm-and-your-douchebag-of-the-day/|title=sxePhil: A Little News, A Little Sarcasm, and Your Douchebag of the Day|publisher=Mind Cryme|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of the older episodes have been noted to include racy thumbnails, such as ''Big Boobs and You''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sarno|first=David|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/entertainment/ca-webscout14|title=The bait is sexy; be prepared for a switch|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 14, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> As of June 2013, the video now holds a thumbnail of DeFranco speaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=big+boobs+and+you&oq=big+boobs+and+you&gs_l=youtube.3...1873918.1876215.0.1876296.17.17.0.0.0.0.203.1898.5j10j1.16.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.8xWrx1Hzeeo|title=''big boobs and you'' search query|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The video was chosen as one of DeFranco's top five YouTube moments by ''New Media Rockstars''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Klima|first=Jeff|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/01/phil-defranco-to-retire-the-top-5-phil-defranco-moments-on-youtube/|title=PHIL DEFRANCO TO RETIRE?
