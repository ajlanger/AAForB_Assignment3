He has played in the Premier League and [[English Football League]] for Newcastle United, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. \n\nCarroll started his professional career with Newcastle United in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with Preston North End, during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the last day of that month's [[transfer window]], Carroll signed for Liverpool for a fee of \u00a335&nbsp;million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. He was bought to replace [[Fernando Torres]], who moved from Liverpool to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on the same day for a fee of \u00a350&nbsp;million. An injury sustained in December delayed Carroll's Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a \u00a32&nbsp;million loan deal that would see him spend a season-long loan at West Ham United. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of \u00a315&nbsp;million. He spent six injury-impacted years at West Ham, and was released in 2019 at the end of his contract. That August, as a free agent, Carroll re-signed with his boyhood club Newcastle. \n\nCarroll played nine matches for England between 2010 and 2012, scoring twice, including one goal at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Newcastle United===\n====2006\u201307====\n[[File:Andy Carroll - April 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Carroll playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2010]]\n\nCarroll, an occasional scorer in [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Newcastle United F.C.

He has played in the Premier League and [[English Football League]] for Newcastle United, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. \n\nCarroll started his professional career with Newcastle United in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with Preston North End, during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the last day of that month's [[transfer window]], Carroll signed for Liverpool for a fee of \u00a335&nbsp;million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. He was bought to replace [[Fernando Torres]], who moved from Liverpool to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on the same day for a fee of \u00a350&nbsp;million. An injury sustained in December delayed Carroll's Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a \u00a32&nbsp;million loan deal that would see him spend a season-long loan at West Ham United. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of \u00a315&nbsp;million. He spent six injury-impacted years at West Ham, and was released in 2019 at the end of his contract. That August, as a free agent, Carroll re-signed with his boyhood club Newcastle. \n\nCarroll played nine matches for England between 2010 and 2012, scoring twice, including one goal at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Newcastle United===\n====2006\u201307====\n[[File:Andy Carroll - April 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Carroll playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2010]]\n\nCarroll, an occasional scorer in [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Newcastle United F.C.
