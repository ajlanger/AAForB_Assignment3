These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.

These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.
