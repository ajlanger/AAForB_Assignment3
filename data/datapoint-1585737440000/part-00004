It was announced during the PlayStation 4 press conference on 20 February 2013, and, after several delays, was released worldwide in October 2014.\n\n''Driveclub'' is a racing game in which players compete in racing events around the world in a variety of different fashions. Players can compete in clubs with other players, earning a reputation as one of the best clubs, and leveling up to unlock better items. Another game mode is tour, essentially a campaign mode. Players can compete in standard races, as well as time trials, drifting events, and championship tournaments, which may take place in [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Scotland]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and [[Chile]]. Players may customize their car, their club, or their driver, and may complete optional challenges during events. A weather system and day-night cycle is also included as [[downloadable content]].\n\n''Driveclub'' was released to a fairly mixed critical reception. Critics praised the visuals, sound design, and the controls, but criticized the online playability, the inconsistent AI and a lack of gameplay variety. As of July 2015, the game has reached 2 million copies sold, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling PlayStation 4 video games|best-selling PlayStation 4 video games]].\n\nThe online servers for Driveclub were shutdown on 31 March 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashgear.com/ps4s-driveclub-will-shut-down-be-taken-offline-in-2020-31571657/|title=PS4's Driveclub will shut down in 2020|work=SlashGear|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=20 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Driveclub'' is a [[Racing video game|racing game]] in which players compete in races around the world in several different game modes. A major focus of the game is the club aspect. Players may join a club or create their own and will compete against other clubs to ultimately see whose club is the best. Clubs consist of up to six players. Players complete challenges together representing their club and earn fame and XP. The player earns fame by driving well and completing challenges. Fame determines the player's level as well as the club level. As the player levels up, they automatically unlock items, such as new vehicles, accolades, or colour schemes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/05/22/delving-into-the-user-interface-and-social-gaming-of-driveclub/|title=Delving Into The User Interface And Social Gaming Of Driveclub|work=TheSixthAxis|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> Every team member's action contributes to the club's overall success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/feature/a572687/how-ps4-racer-driveclub-puts-social-front-and-centre.html#~pcRyOdq77oy2UQ|title=How PS4 racer DRIVECLUB puts social front and centre|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe game's tracks and environments are inspired by real places in diverse regions across the globe, such as Norway and India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/769849-14-things-might-know-driveclub#/slide/13|title=14 Things You Might Not Know About Driveclub|first=Jonathon|last=Leack|work=[[CraveOnline]]|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> ''Driveclub'' features dynamic weather system such as rain and snowfall and a day-night cycle.

racing game to have enough faith in its core handling to eschew driving assists.\" He criticized the weak damage and characterized crashes as unsatisfying. He also discouraged playing unconnected, adding \"Never have I seen such a dull, lifeless and formulaic single-player mode transformed so spectacularly by online connectivity.\"<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dale North from [[Destructoid]] gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its responsive, satisfying control and impressive sounds, as well as highly detailed environments, while criticizing the lack of replay value, constant [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] car bashing and crashing in single-player and infrequent weird visual bugs in the in-car views, but still summarized the game as \"has enough to offer over other new and upcoming racing alternatives out there.\"<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n\nLudwig Kietzmann of [[Joystiq]] also praised the stunning environments and excellent sound design. However, he also criticized the abusive AI cars and considered them ruin the whole single-player experience because players often get bumped, smashed and shoved off the road repeatedly. He also criticized the lack of difficulty options.<ref name=\"Joystiq\"/> Luke Reilly of [[IGN]] gave the game a 7.9/10. He praised its great sense of speed and graphics, which is described as \"the best-looking racing game ever seen on a console\", but criticized the overly aggressive and frustrating AI grates and the difficult drifting when compared to the accessible handling, but still summarized the game as \"a modest, conventional arcade racer rather than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> John Robertson from ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the game an 8/10, also praising its graphics and the Clubs system, but criticizing the lack of variety in race types and challenges, as well as the arcade-handling, as he described it \"sits at odds with the purity of available events\".<ref name=\"CVG\"/>\n\nHowever, [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd gave the game a 5/10. He praised the attractive cars and race tracks featured, but criticized the soundtrack and the overall presentation of the game. He also praised the graphics of the game, but stated that the environment and the surroundings are \"as lifeless as postcards\".<ref name=\"GSpot\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]'s Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 2/5, praising its leaderboards, lighting and graphics, but criticizing the confusing menu, overly mechanical AI drivers, weirdly grippy car handling and lack of fun element.

Players can compete in standard races, as well as time trials, drifting events, and championship tournaments, which may take place in [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Scotland]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and [[Chile]]. Players may customize their car, their club, or their driver, and may complete optional challenges during events. A weather system and day-night cycle is also included as [[downloadable content]].\n\n''Driveclub'' was released to a fairly mixed critical reception. Critics praised the visuals, sound design, and the controls, but criticized the online playability, the inconsistent AI and a lack of gameplay variety.

Clubs consist of up to six players. Players complete challenges together representing their club and earn fame and XP. The player earns fame by driving well and completing challenges. Fame determines the player's level as well as the club level.

name=\"MC\"/>\n\nJustin Towell from [[GamesRadar]] gave the game an 8/10, praising its challenge system, accessible handling and beginner-friendly gameplay, saying \"it's a big deal for a modern racing game to have enough faith in its core handling to eschew driving assists.\" He criticized the weak damage and characterized crashes as unsatisfying. He also discouraged playing unconnected, adding \"Never have I seen such a dull, lifeless and formulaic single-player mode transformed so spectacularly by online connectivity.\"<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dale North from [[Destructoid]] gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its responsive, satisfying control and impressive sounds, as well as highly detailed environments, while criticizing the lack of replay value, constant [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] car bashing and crashing in single-player and infrequent weird visual bugs in the in-car views, but still summarized the game as \"has enough to offer over other new and upcoming racing alternatives out there.\"<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n\nLudwig Kietzmann of [[Joystiq]] also praised the stunning environments and excellent sound design. However, he also criticized the abusive AI cars and considered them ruin the whole single-player experience because players often get bumped, smashed and shoved off the road repeatedly. He also criticized the lack of difficulty options.<ref name=\"Joystiq\"/> Luke Reilly of [[IGN]] gave the game a 7.9/10. He praised its great sense of speed and graphics, which is described as \"the best-looking racing game ever seen on a console\", but criticized the overly aggressive and frustrating AI grates and the difficult drifting when compared to the accessible handling, but still summarized the game as \"a modest, conventional arcade racer rather than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> John Robertson from ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the game an 8/10, also praising its graphics and the Clubs system, but criticizing the lack of variety in race types and challenges, as well as the arcade-handling, as he described it \"sits at odds with the purity of available events\".<ref name=\"CVG\"/>\n\nHowever, [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd gave the game a 5/10. He praised the attractive cars and race tracks featured, but criticized the soundtrack and the overall presentation of the game. He also praised the graphics of the game, but stated that the environment and the surroundings are \"as lifeless as postcards\".<ref name=\"GSpot\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]'s Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 2/5, praising its leaderboards, lighting and graphics, but criticizing the confusing menu, overly mechanical AI drivers, weirdly grippy car handling and lack of fun element. He summarized the game as \"a weird throwback to the old, dark days of console driving games\".<ref name=\"GB\"/>\n\nPost launch, Evolution Studios continued to support their game with 18 months of free content updates and an extensive DLC Season Pass and as a result GamesRadar re-reviewed the game and changed their review score to 4.5/5. After the sudden closure of developer Evolution Studios on 22 March 2016, [[GamesRadar]] also published an article stating their confusion as to why this occurred,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/driveclub-studio-failed-by-public-perception-not-lack-of-talent/|title=The Driveclub studio was failed by public perception, not a lack of talent|newspaper=gamesradar|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref> stating that the studio was failed by 'public perception' after its rocky launch. It continued to expand by praising the game and its development turn around: \"[[Evolution Studios]] delivered arguably the finest collection of post-release content gaming has ever seen. Certainly any driving game.\", \"a photo mode worthy of release as a standalone tech demo.\" and \"The best damn wet weather effects in all of gaming\" were some of the praises given.
