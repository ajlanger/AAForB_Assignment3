He later expanded this into the book ''Earth Not a Globe'', proposing the Earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, [[Antarctica]]. Rowbotham further held that the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] were {{Convert|3000|mi}} above Earth and that the \"cosmos\" was {{Convert|3100|mi}} above the Earth.<ref name=\"Schick 1995\"/> He also published a leaflet titled ''The Inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures'', which argued that the \"Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture\".<ref>{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|p=46}}</ref>\n\nRowbotham and followers like [[William Carpenter (flat Earth theorist)|William Carpenter]] gained attention by successful use of [[pseudoscience]] in public debates with leading scientists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].<ref>''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 7 April 1870.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title =The Form of the Earth\u2014A Shock of Opinions |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 August 1871 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/08/10/78770850.pdf |accessdate= 2 November 2007 }}</ref><ref>Hampden, John (1870): The Bedford Canal swindle detected & exposed.
