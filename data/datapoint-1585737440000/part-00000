People experienced a \"spiritual emptiness\"  and their thinking became marked by a \"lazy passivity\" due to the \"absence of will from the life of thought\". In modern Europe, Steiner claimed that people would \"allow their thoughts to take possession of them\", and these thoughts were increasingly filled with abstraction and \"pure, natural scientific thinking\". The educated middle classes began to think in a way that was \"devoid of spirit\", with their minds becoming \"dimmer and darker\", and increasing empty of spirit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/SpiEmp_index.html |title=Lecture: Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date=1919-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n\nLouis Dupr\u00e9, a Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, argues that the \"spiritual emptiness of our time is a symptom of its religious poverty\". He claims that \"many people never experience any emptiness: they are too busy to feel much absence of any kind\"; they only realize their spiritual emptiness if \"painful personal experiences -- the death of a loved one, the collapse of a marriage, the alienation of a child, the failure of a business\" shock them into reassessing their sense of meaning.<ref>SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE SURVIVAL OF CHRISTIANITY:\nREFLECTIONS AT THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM\nby Louis Dupr\u00e9  http://www.crosscurrents.org/dupre.htm.</ref>\n\nSpiritual emptiness has been associated with juvenile violence. In John C. Thomas' 1999 book ''How Juvenile Violence Begins: Spiritual Emptiness'', he argues that youth in impoverished indigenous communities who feel empty may turn to fighting and aggressive crime to fill their sense of meaninglessness. In Cornell University professor [[James Garbarino]]'s 1999 book ''Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'', he argues that \"neglect, shame, spiritual emptiness, alienation, anger and access to guns are a few of the elements common to violent boys\". A professor of human development, Garbarino claims that violent boys have an \"alienation from positive role models\" and \"a spiritual emptiness that spawns despair\". These youth are seduced by the violent fantasy of the US gun culture, which provides negative role models of tough, aggressive men who use power to get what they want. He claims that boys can be helped by giving them \"a sense of purpose\" and \"spiritual anchors\" that can \"anchor boys in empathy and socially engaged moral thinking\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |title=Cornell News: \"Lost Boys\" about teen violence |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=1999-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617200955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |archivedate=2012-06-17 }}</ref>\n\nSpiritual emptiness is often connected with addiction, especially by Christian-influenced addiction organizations and counsellors. Bill Wilson, the founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], argued that one of the impacts of alcoholism was causing a spiritual emptiness in heavy drinkers. In Abraham J. Twerski's 1997 book ''Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception'', he argues that when people feel spiritually empty, they often turn to addictive behaviors to fill the inner void. In contrast to having an empty stomach, which is a clear feeling, having spiritual emptiness is hard to identify, so it fills humans with a \"vague unrest\".  While people may try to resolve this emptiness by obsessively having sex, overeating, or taking drugs or alcohol, these addictions only give temporary satisfaction. When a person facing a crisis due to feeling spiritually empty is able to stop one addiction, such as compulsive sex, they often just trade it in for another addictive behaviour, such as gambling or overeating.<ref>Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception By Abraham J.

The concept of \"emptiness\" was important to a \"good deal of 19th\u201320th century Western imaginative literature\".<ref name=eb/> Novelist [[Franz Kafka]] depicted a meaningless bizarre world in ''[[The Trial]]'' and the [[existentialism|existentialist]] French authors sketched a world cut off from purpose or reason in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[La Naus\u00e9e]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'\u00e9tranger]]''. Existentialism influenced 20th century poet [[T.S. Eliot]], whose poem \u201c[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]\u201d  describes an \"anti-hero or alienated soul, running away from or confronting the emptiness of his or her existence\". Professor Gordon Bigelow argues that the existentialist theme of \"spiritual barrenness is commonplace in literature of the 20th century\", which in addition to Eliot includes [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner, Steinbeck and Anderson.<ref name=mrjeffrey/>\n\nFilm adaptations of a number of existentialist novels capture the bleak sense of emptiness espoused by Sartre and Camus. This theme of emptiness has also been used in modern screenplays. [[Mark Romanek]]'s 1985 film ''[[Static (1986 film)|Static]]'' tells the surreal story of a struggling inventor and crucifix factory worker named Ernie who feels spiritually empty because he is saddened by his parents' death in an accident. Screenwriter Michael Tolkin's 1994 film ''[[The New Age (film)|The New Age]]'' examines \"cultural hipness and spiritual emptiness\", creating a \"dark, ambitious, unsettling\" film that depicts a fashionable LA couple who \"are miserable in the midst of their sterile plenty\", and whose souls are stunted by their lives of empty sex, consumption, and distractions.<ref>{{cite web|author= Lisa Schwarzbaum|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303914,00.html |title=The New Age Review  |publisher=EW.com |date=1994-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' examines the spiritual emptiness of life in the US suburbs.

The film, which is set amidst the decadence of the early 1980s, depicts an assortment of socially alienated, mainly well-off characters who numb their sense of emptiness with casual sex, alcohol, and drugs. \n\nContemporary architecture critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] argues that \"[[horror vacui]]\" (which is Latin for \"fear of emptiness\") is a key principle of design. He claims that it has become an obsessive quality that is the \"driving force in contemporary American taste\".

As well, emptiness is \"linked to the creative Void, meaning that it is a state of complete receptivity and perfect enlightenment\", the merging of the \"ego with its own essence\", which Buddhists call the \"clear light\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotinus.com/spiritual%20emptiness_copy.htm |title=About Spiritual Emptiness or the Void |publisher=Plotinus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Ven. Thubten Chodron's 2005 interview with Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the lama noted that we \"...ordinary beings who haven't realized emptiness don't see things as similar to illusions\", and we do not \"realize that things are merely labeled by mind and exist by mere name\".<ref name=lamazopa/> He argues that \"when we meditate on emptiness, we drop an atom bomb on this [sense of a] truly existent I\" and we realize that \"what appears true... isn't true\". By this, the lama is claiming that what we think is real\u2014our thoughts and feelings about people and things\u2014\"exists by being merely labeled\". He argues that meditators who attain knowledge of a state of emptiness are able to realize that their thoughts are merely illusions from labelling by the mind.<ref name=lamazopa/>\n\n===Taoism===\nIn [[Taoism]], attaining a state of emptiness is viewed as a state of stillness and placidity which is the \"mirror of the universe\" and the \"pure mind\".<ref name=taopage>{{cite web|url=http://www.taopage.org/emptiness.html |title=Taoism - Wu - Emptiness |publisher=Taopage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The [[Tao Te Ching]] claims that emptiness is related to the \"Tao, the Great Principle, the Creator and Sustainer of everything in the universe\". It is argued that it is the \"state of mind of the Taoist disciple who follows the Tao\", who has successfully emptied the mind \"of all wishes and ideas not fitted with the Tao's Movement\". For a person who attains a state of emptiness, the \"still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all things\", a state of \"vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action\" which is the \"perfection of the Tao and its characteristics, the \"mirror of the universe\" and the \"pure mind\".<ref name=taopage/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Boredom]]\n* [[Empty nest syndrome]]\n* [[Nihilism]]\n* [[Physiology]]\n* [[Soul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Moss, Robert.

In modern Europe, Steiner claimed that people would \"allow their thoughts to take possession of them\", and these thoughts were increasingly filled with abstraction and \"pure, natural scientific thinking\". The educated middle classes began to think in a way that was \"devoid of spirit\", with their minds becoming \"dimmer and darker\", and increasing empty of spirit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/SpiEmp_index.html |title=Lecture: Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date=1919-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n\nLouis Dupr\u00e9, a Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, argues that the \"spiritual emptiness of our time is a symptom of its religious poverty\". He claims that \"many people never experience any emptiness: they are too busy to feel much absence of any kind\"; they only realize their spiritual emptiness if \"painful personal experiences -- the death of a loved one, the collapse of a marriage, the alienation of a child, the failure of a business\" shock them into reassessing their sense of meaning.<ref>SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE SURVIVAL OF CHRISTIANITY:\nREFLECTIONS AT THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM\nby Louis Dupr\u00e9  http://www.crosscurrents.org/dupre.htm.</ref>\n\nSpiritual emptiness has been associated with juvenile violence. In John C. Thomas' 1999 book ''How Juvenile Violence Begins: Spiritual Emptiness'', he argues that youth in impoverished indigenous communities who feel empty may turn to fighting and aggressive crime to fill their sense of meaninglessness. In Cornell University professor [[James Garbarino]]'s 1999 book ''Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'', he argues that \"neglect, shame, spiritual emptiness, alienation, anger and access to guns are a few of the elements common to violent boys\". A professor of human development, Garbarino claims that violent boys have an \"alienation from positive role models\" and \"a spiritual emptiness that spawns despair\". These youth are seduced by the violent fantasy of the US gun culture, which provides negative role models of tough, aggressive men who use power to get what they want. He claims that boys can be helped by giving them \"a sense of purpose\" and \"spiritual anchors\" that can \"anchor boys in empathy and socially engaged moral thinking\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |title=Cornell News: \"Lost Boys\" about teen violence |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=1999-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617200955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |archivedate=2012-06-17 }}</ref>\n\nSpiritual emptiness is often connected with addiction, especially by Christian-influenced addiction organizations and counsellors. Bill Wilson, the founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], argued that one of the impacts of alcoholism was causing a spiritual emptiness in heavy drinkers. In Abraham J. Twerski's 1997 book ''Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception'', he argues that when people feel spiritually empty, they often turn to addictive behaviors to fill the inner void. In contrast to having an empty stomach, which is a clear feeling, having spiritual emptiness is hard to identify, so it fills humans with a \"vague unrest\".  While people may try to resolve this emptiness by obsessively having sex, overeating, or taking drugs or alcohol, these addictions only give temporary satisfaction. When a person facing a crisis due to feeling spiritually empty is able to stop one addiction, such as compulsive sex, they often just trade it in for another addictive behaviour, such as gambling or overeating.<ref>Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception By Abraham J.

The concept of \"emptiness\" was important to a \"good deal of 19th\u201320th century Western imaginative literature\".<ref name=eb/> Novelist [[Franz Kafka]] depicted a meaningless bizarre world in ''[[The Trial]]'' and the [[existentialism|existentialist]] French authors sketched a world cut off from purpose or reason in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[La Naus\u00e9e]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'\u00e9tranger]]''. Existentialism influenced 20th century poet [[T.S. Eliot]], whose poem \u201c[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]\u201d  describes an \"anti-hero or alienated soul, running away from or confronting the emptiness of his or her existence\". Professor Gordon Bigelow argues that the existentialist theme of \"spiritual barrenness is commonplace in literature of the 20th century\", which in addition to Eliot includes [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner, Steinbeck and Anderson.<ref name=mrjeffrey/>\n\nFilm adaptations of a number of existentialist novels capture the bleak sense of emptiness espoused by Sartre and Camus. This theme of emptiness has also been used in modern screenplays. [[Mark Romanek]]'s 1985 film ''[[Static (1986 film)|Static]]'' tells the surreal story of a struggling inventor and crucifix factory worker named Ernie who feels spiritually empty because he is saddened by his parents' death in an accident. Screenwriter Michael Tolkin's 1994 film ''[[The New Age (film)|The New Age]]'' examines \"cultural hipness and spiritual emptiness\", creating a \"dark, ambitious, unsettling\" film that depicts a fashionable LA couple who \"are miserable in the midst of their sterile plenty\", and whose souls are stunted by their lives of empty sex, consumption, and distractions.<ref>{{cite web|author= Lisa Schwarzbaum|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303914,00.html |title=The New Age Review  |publisher=EW.com |date=1994-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' examines the spiritual emptiness of life in the US suburbs.

The film is based on Ellis' 1994 collection of short stories of the [[The Informers|same name]]. The film, which is set amidst the decadence of the early 1980s, depicts an assortment of socially alienated, mainly well-off characters who numb their sense of emptiness with casual sex, alcohol, and drugs. \n\nContemporary architecture critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] argues that \"[[horror vacui]]\" (which is Latin for \"fear of emptiness\") is a key principle of design. He claims that it has become an obsessive quality that is the \"driving force in contemporary American taste\". Muschamp states that \"along with the commercial interests that exploit this interest, it is the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban spaces, and even suburban sprawl.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |title=ArtLex's Ho-Hz page |publisher=Artlex.com |accessdate=2012-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429031635/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |archive-date=2012-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFilms that depict nothingness, shadows and vagueness, either in a visual sense or a moral sense are appreciated in genres such as [[film noir]]. As well, travellers and artists are often intrigued by and attracted to vast empty spaces, such as open deserts, barren wastelands or salt flats, and the open sea.\n\nIn visual arts emptiness and absence were recognized as phenomena that characterize not only particular works of [[art]] (e.g. [[Yves Klein]]) but also as a more general tendency within the history of [[modern art]] and [[aesthetics]]. Following [[Davor D\u017ealto]]'s argument on the modern concept of art, the gradual elimination of particular elements that traditionally characterized [[visual arts]], which results in emptiness, is the most important phenomenon within the history and [[theory of art]] over the past two hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://instifdt.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Davor-Dzalto.pdf |title=Art: A Brief History of Absence (From the Conception and Birth, Life and Death, to the Living Deadness of Art) |publisher=Davor D\u017ealto |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==In Eastern cultures==\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101}}\nThe Buddhist term ''emptiness'' (Skt.

As well, emptiness is \"linked to the creative Void, meaning that it is a state of complete receptivity and perfect enlightenment\", the merging of the \"ego with its own essence\", which Buddhists call the \"clear light\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotinus.com/spiritual%20emptiness_copy.htm |title=About Spiritual Emptiness or the Void |publisher=Plotinus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Ven. Thubten Chodron's 2005 interview with Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the lama noted that we \"...ordinary beings who haven't realized emptiness don't see things as similar to illusions\", and we do not \"realize that things are merely labeled by mind and exist by mere name\".<ref name=lamazopa/> He argues that \"when we meditate on emptiness, we drop an atom bomb on this [sense of a] truly existent I\" and we realize that \"what appears true... isn't true\". By this, the lama is claiming that what we think is real\u2014our thoughts and feelings about people and things\u2014\"exists by being merely labeled\". He argues that meditators who attain knowledge of a state of emptiness are able to realize that their thoughts are merely illusions from labelling by the mind.<ref name=lamazopa/>\n\n===Taoism===\nIn [[Taoism]], attaining a state of emptiness is viewed as a state of stillness and placidity which is the \"mirror of the universe\" and the \"pure mind\".<ref name=taopage>{{cite web|url=http://www.taopage.org/emptiness.html |title=Taoism - Wu - Emptiness |publisher=Taopage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The [[Tao Te Ching]] claims that emptiness is related to the \"Tao, the Great Principle, the Creator and Sustainer of everything in the universe\". It is argued that it is the \"state of mind of the Taoist disciple who follows the Tao\", who has successfully emptied the mind \"of all wishes and ideas not fitted with the Tao's Movement\". For a person who attains a state of emptiness, the \"still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all things\", a state of \"vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action\" which is the \"perfection of the Tao and its characteristics, the \"mirror of the universe\" and the \"pure mind\".<ref name=taopage/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Boredom]]\n* [[Empty nest syndrome]]\n* [[Nihilism]]\n* [[Physiology]]\n* [[Soul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Moss, Robert.
