Upon the event of Digger's live recording being played on [[WMUH]] the word of the band spread quickly, which led to the band's sign to Hopeless Records. The band released their first LP, ''Powerbait'', and toured until the band came back to the studio to record ''The Promise of an Uncertain Future''.  The band became a three piece in this era, and launched a world tour. Then ''Monte Carlo'' was released as a follow up. Not very long afterward, Digger released the ''[[Trainwreck EP]]''.  Then after another member change, Digger released what would be their last full album, ''[[Keystone (album)|Keystone]]''.   The departure of the group's bassist and guitarist resulted in their canceling their tour to support the album. After replacing the members, the group continued touring and recording up until the summer of 2004, when they disbanded.\n\nThree of five songs of the final recording of Digger have been posted on [[purevolume.com]] for free download. This final EP is entitled [[Seaside Diner]].\n\nIn October 2015, original members Matthew Gregorec and Chris Benner decided to reform with Gregorec taking over second guitar responsibilities, Ben Stephens replacing Gregorec on the bass, and Ryan Keller joining the pop-punk veterans on the drums.\n\n==Members==\n;Founding members\n*Chris Benner - guitar, vocals (1995\u2013Present)\n*Matt Gregorec - vocals, bass (1995\u2013Present)\n*Mike \"Maniac\" Fisher - drums (1995\u20131998)\n*Phil Nelson - vocals, guitar (1995\u20131997) (Deceased)\n\n;Later members\n*Jeff Kish - guitar, vocals (1997-1999)\n*Mark Kale - guitar (1999-2000)\n*Mike Bowen - drums (1999-2000)\n*Ben Stephens - bass (2000\u2013Present)\n*Garrett Hoskins - guitar (2000\u20132002)\n*Mike Kelly - drums (2001\u20132004)\n*Warren Cooke - bass (2003\u20132004)\n*Tim Wright - guitar (2003\u20132004)\n*Jay Thomas - bass (2004)\n*Ryan Keller - drums (2015-Present)\n*Joel Heidecker - guitar (1997-1999)\n*Tommy Cobb - bass (2018-Present)\n\n==Discography==\n*''Powerbait'' ([[Hopeless Records]], 1996)\n*''The Promise of an Uncertain Future'' (Hopeless, 1998)\n*''Monte Carlo'' (Hopeless, 2000)\n*''Trainwreck'' EP (Hopeless, 2001)\n*''Keystone'' (Hopeless, 2002)\n*''Tattoo Broken Hearts'' EP ([[Wynona Records]], 2003)\n*''Seaside Diner'' EP (Not released on label, 2004)\n\n==References==\n*[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p480914|pure_url=yes}} Digger] at [[AllMusic]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Digger}}\n[[Category:Pop punk groups from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Hopeless Records artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Digger\n| image                 = \n| caption            = \n| image_size            = \n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               = \n| origin              = [[Lehigh Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States\n| instrument          = \n| genre               = [[Pop punk]]\n| occupation          = \n| years_active        = 1995\u20132004, 2015-present\n| label               = [[Hopeless Records]]\n| associated_acts     = \n| website                 = \n| current_members     = Chris Benner, Matthew Gregorec, Ryan Keller, Ben Stephens, Tommy Cobb\n| past_members        = Joel Heidecker, Phil Nelson, Jeff Kish, Mike Kelly, Garrett Hoskins\n}}\n\n'''Digger''' is an American [[pop punk]] band from [[Pennsylvania]], signed to [[Hopeless Records]].\n\n==History==\nDigger formed in the [[Lehigh Valley]] in the mid-1990s and signed to [[Hopeless Records]] in 1996.
