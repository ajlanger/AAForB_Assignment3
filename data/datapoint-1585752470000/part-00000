It was written by [[Mike Bullen]], directed by [[Ciaran Donnelly (director)|Ciaran Donnelly]], and was first broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) travel to [[Sydney]], Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod ([[Gary Sweet]]) suspects that Pete is only marrying her to get access to his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets [[cold feet (metaphor)|cold feet]] and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark ([[Sean Pertwee]]) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.\n\nThe episode was conceived by Mike Bullen and ''Cold Feet''{{'}}s executive producer [[Andy Harries]] in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney and decided to contrive the main plot of the fourth series so the characters would end up in Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in [[Manchester]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], England. After [[location scouting]] and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]] for the wedding scenes, [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the [[Sydney Opera House|Opera House]]. The episode was watched by nearly nine&nbsp;million people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a \"pick of the day\". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role. The episode represented the series when it won the award for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2002]].\n\n==Plot==\nAdam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) arrive in Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) hastily arranged wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison ([[Gary Sweet]]) is surprised to learn that his daughter is marrying a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fianc\u00e9 Shawn ([[Sandy Winton]]), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.\n\nRachel, who is spending most of her time in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy ([[Susannah Doyle]]). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men in order to have a child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by [[Cold Feet (series 3)#ep20|his extramarital affair]] is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt ([[Sean Pertwee]]), a man ''she'' has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.\n\nPete and Adam make up after their row and Adam goes to Jo's to collect Pete's clothes. Her regret over her breakup with Pete leads Adam to convince Rod that he should give the wedding his blessing. He follows David to a business meeting with Rod, which David has arranged as a prelude to emigrating his family to Sydney, and with David's help changes Rod's mind about Pete. Rod later meets Jo and Pete to give them his blessing, and they reconcile. On the day of the wedding, David finally reveals his plans for the family to Karen, unaware that Mark is in the apartment. Karen is surprised that David has made the plans, including finding a house for them to live in. Mark is irritated by David's attitude and reveals the affair to him. Enraged, David lashes out at Mark and the two fight. Karen angrily tells Mark to leave. Outside the hotel, Rachel goes into premature labour. Adam rushes her to hospital, where she is taken into surgery. At the wedding venue, Pete asks David to take Adam's place as best man. As Adam has the rings, David volunteers his own wedding band to Pete, and Karen does the same for Jo. Pete and Jo exchange their wedding vows and are pronounced husband and wife. After the wedding, Karen tries to approach David but he just walks away, telling her \"no more\". Later, Pete, Jo and Karen join Adam and Rachel at the hospital, where they are introduced to the baby, Matthew Sydney Williams. David flies home alone in tears.\n\n==Production==\n=== Writing ===\nThe episode was devised following a lecture given by writer [[Mike Bullen]] and executive producer [[Andy Harries]] at the [[Screen Producers Association of Australia]] conference in November 2000.<ref name=deLisle>de Lisle, Rosanna (11 December 2000). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news001211_0480_2197 Manchester six go walkabout]\".

Video Collection International.</ref> Bullen and Harries already knew that actress [[Fay Ripley]] did not want to renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted \"for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go\".<ref name=Harries/> The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1.<ref name=Campbell/> As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, \"One of them [the characters], whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters.\"<ref name=deLisle/> Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country.<ref name=deLisle/><ref>Courtis, Brian (26 April 2001). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE0104262ELDJ5DACMQ Cold Feet steps south]\".

The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as \"[[shrimp on the barbie|prawns on the barbie]]\", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue.<ref name=Campbell/> Bullen told the ''[[Sun Herald]]'', \"I really wanted to go beyond '[[no worries]]' and '[[she'll be right mate]]'.

This episode was produced as the final episode of ''Cold Feet''; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would like to write a final run of episodes.<ref name=Harries/>\n\n===Filming===\n{{quote box\n|width     = 22em\n|align     = right\n|fontsize  = 102%\n|quote     = Continuity was an absolute nightmare [...] You had actors walking through a door in Manchester and emerging onto a street in Sydney, and we had to make sure that they were wearing the same clothes, with the same skin tones, all the way through.

It was written by [[Mike Bullen]], directed by [[Ciaran Donnelly (director)|Ciaran Donnelly]], and was first broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) travel to [[Sydney]], Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod ([[Gary Sweet]]) suspects that Pete is only marrying her to get access to his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets [[cold feet (metaphor)|cold feet]] and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark ([[Sean Pertwee]]) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.\n\nThe episode was conceived by Mike Bullen and ''Cold Feet''{{'}}s executive producer [[Andy Harries]] in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney and decided to contrive the main plot of the fourth series so the characters would end up in Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in [[Manchester]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], England. After [[location scouting]] and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]] for the wedding scenes, [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the [[Sydney Opera House|Opera House]]. The episode was watched by nearly nine&nbsp;million people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a \"pick of the day\". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role. The episode represented the series when it won the award for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2002]].\n\n==Plot==\nAdam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) arrive in Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) hastily arranged wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison ([[Gary Sweet]]) is surprised to learn that his daughter is marrying a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fianc\u00e9 Shawn ([[Sandy Winton]]), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.\n\nRachel, who is spending most of her time in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy ([[Susannah Doyle]]). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men in order to have a child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by [[Cold Feet (series 3)#ep20|his extramarital affair]] is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt ([[Sean Pertwee]]), a man ''she'' has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.\n\nPete and Adam make up after their row and Adam goes to Jo's to collect Pete's clothes. Her regret over her breakup with Pete leads Adam to convince Rod that he should give the wedding his blessing. He follows David to a business meeting with Rod, which David has arranged as a prelude to emigrating his family to Sydney, and with David's help changes Rod's mind about Pete. Rod later meets Jo and Pete to give them his blessing, and they reconcile. On the day of the wedding, David finally reveals his plans for the family to Karen, unaware that Mark is in the apartment. Karen is surprised that David has made the plans, including finding a house for them to live in. Mark is irritated by David's attitude and reveals the affair to him. Enraged, David lashes out at Mark and the two fight. Karen angrily tells Mark to leave. Outside the hotel, Rachel goes into premature labour. Adam rushes her to hospital, where she is taken into surgery. At the wedding venue, Pete asks David to take Adam's place as best man. As Adam has the rings, David volunteers his own wedding band to Pete, and Karen does the same for Jo. Pete and Jo exchange their wedding vows and are pronounced husband and wife. After the wedding, Karen tries to approach David but he just walks away, telling her \"no more\". Later, Pete, Jo and Karen join Adam and Rachel at the hospital, where they are introduced to the baby, Matthew Sydney Williams. David flies home alone in tears.\n\n==Production==\n=== Writing ===\nThe episode was devised following a lecture given by writer [[Mike Bullen]] and executive producer [[Andy Harries]] at the [[Screen Producers Association of Australia]] conference in November 2000.<ref name=deLisle>de Lisle, Rosanna (11 December 2000). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news001211_0480_2197 Manchester six go walkabout]\".

''Interview on bonus disc of \"Cold Feet: The Complete Story\" DVD'' [DVD]. Video Collection International.</ref> Bullen and Harries already knew that actress [[Fay Ripley]] did not want to renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted \"for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go\".<ref name=Harries/> The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1.<ref name=Campbell/> As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, \"One of them [the characters], whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters.\"<ref name=deLisle/> Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country.<ref name=deLisle/><ref>Courtis, Brian (26 April 2001). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE0104262ELDJ5DACMQ Cold Feet steps south]\".

The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as \"[[shrimp on the barbie|prawns on the barbie]]\", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue.<ref name=Campbell/> Bullen told the ''[[Sun Herald]]'', \"I really wanted to go beyond '[[no worries]]' and '[[she'll be right mate]]'.

''Western Mail'' (Western Mail & Echo): p.&nbsp;4.</ref> The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing.<ref name=Harries/> After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the ''Sun Herald'' that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet.<ref name=Sams>Sams, Christine (7 October 2001). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news011009_0472_8800 TV's coolest Brits warm their feet in Aussie sand]\". ''Herald Sun'' (The Herald and Weekly Times): p.&nbsp;45.</ref> Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of ''Cold Feet''; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would like to write a final run of episodes.<ref name=Harries/>\n\n===Filming===\n{{quote box\n|width     = 22em\n|align     = right\n|fontsize  = 102%\n|quote     = Continuity was an absolute nightmare [...] You had actors walking through a door in Manchester and emerging onto a street in Sydney, and we had to make sure that they were wearing the same clothes, with the same skin tones, all the way through.

As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the [[University of Manchester]].

The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the [[Lowry Hotel]] in Salford and exterior scenes of the hotel were filmed at the [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|GMEX Centre]].

Robert Bathurst said, \"We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together.
