It is about Norman's uncle, Australian [[Track and field|track athlete]] [[Peter Norman]], specifically the actions he took at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film provides an insight into an incident at the 1968 Summer Olympics which saw two United States athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], give the [[black power]] salute [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|from the victory dais]] after the [[200 metres|200 metres final]]. The film focuses on the third man on the dais, [[silver medal]] winner Peter Norman, who showed his support for Smith and Carlos by donning an \"[[Olympic Project for Human Rights]]\" (OPHR) badge on his way to the podium. It was also Norman who suggested to Smith and Carlos that they share the black gloves used in their salute, after Carlos had left his gloves in the [[Olympic Village]]. This is the reason for Smith raising his right fist, while Carlos raised his left. Asked later about his support of Smith and Carlos' cause by the world's press, Norman said he opposed his country's government's [[White Australia policy]].\n\nThe film documents the subsequent reprimand of Norman by the Australian Olympic authorities, and his ostracism by the Australian media. Despite Norman running qualifying times for both the 100m and 200m during 1971/72, the Australian Olympic track team did not send him to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. It also documents Norman's reunion with Smith and Carlos, shortly before his death in 2006.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] on 8 June 2008. It was released Australia-wide on 17 July 2008.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Peter Norman]] as himself\n*[[Tommie Smith]] as himself\n*[[John Carlos]] as himself\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\nWhile there had been attempts by American filmmakers to put together a piece on the event, these earlier films had overlooked the actions of Peter Norman. As a result, Matt Norman realised that the full story of his famous uncle had never been told and began filming ''Salute'' at the end of 2002.\n\nWith the help of the [[Film Finance Corporation]] and his local funding body [[Film Victoria]], Norman raised close to two million dollars for post production of the film.\n\nIn 2008, Andrew Mackie and Richard Payton of Transmission films were signed on as Australian distributors and later brought on board [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Pictures Australia]] to release the film nationally in cinemas throughout Australia.\n\n==Awards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n* 2009 \u2013 Won - Atlanta International Documentary Film Festival (aka Atlanta DocuFest): Best Social Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/awards|title=Salute|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n* 2009 \u2013 Won - Santa Cruz Film Festival: Jury Award \u2013 Best Documentary Feature  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n* 2009 \u2013 Nominated - Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards: FCCA Award - Best Feature Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n* 2008 \u2013 Won - Sydney Film Festival: Audience Award - Best Australian Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n* 2008 \u2013 Won - Rhode Island Film Festival: Audience Award \u2013 Best Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n\n==Box office==\n''Salute'' grossed $233,411 at the box office in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/967/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|title=Film Victoria // supporting Victoria's film television and games industry - Film Victoria|website=www.film.vic.gov.au}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cinema of Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0874317|Salute}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.salutethemovie.com/}}\n* {{cite news | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602021024/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23747461-2,00.html | title=In-flight film will urge Olympians to protest | newspaper=Sydney Daily Telegraph | date= 24 May 2008 | accessdate=18 October 2018}} \n* {{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/the-white-guy-becomes-a-hero-on-film/2008/05/07/1210131072250.html | newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | title='The white guy' becomes a hero on film | first=Garry | last=Maddox | date=8 May 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010 }}\n* {{Cite news | url=http://themindunleashed.org/2015/12/the-white-man-in-that-photo.html | publisher=[[The Mind Unleashed]] | title='The White Man in That Photo | first=Riccardo | last=Gazzaniga | date=31 December 2015 | accessdate=4 Jan 2016 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salute}}\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:Australian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the Olympics]]\n[[Category:Australian documentary films]]\n[[Category:Black Power]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about historical events]]\n[[Category:Films about the 1968 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Hirschfelder]]\n[[Category:Australian sports films]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Salute\n| image = Salute2008.jpg\n| caption =\n| director = [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]]\n| producer = [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]]\n| writer = [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]]\n| starring = [[Peter Norman]]<br>[[Tommie Smith]]<br>[[John Carlos]]\n| music = [[David Hirschfelder]]\n| cinematography =\n| editing =\n| distributor = [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Brothers]]\n| released = {{Film date|df=y|2008|07|17}}\n| runtime =\n| country = Australia\n| language = English\n| budget = AU$2,000,000\n}}{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n'''''Salute''''' is a 2008 Australian documentary film written, directed and produced by [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]].
