He also worked on the dating of the age of minerals based on the half-life of radioactive elements and the enrichment of decay products. Strassmann and [[Ernst Walling]] developed the rubidium-strontium method of [[radiometric dating]] in 1936 and 1937, and Strassmann continued this work in 1942 and 1943.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/> \n\nOn 15 February 1944 and again on 24 March 1944, as part of the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II]], the Institute suffered severe bombing damage.\nThe Institute was temporarily relocated to  [[Tailfingen]] (now [[Albstadt]]) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] district, in a textile factory belonging to the Ludwig Haasis company.<ref name=\"Chronik\"/><ref name=\"Palme\"/>\nIn 1946 Strassmann became professor of [[inorganic chemistry]] and nuclear chemistry at the [[University of Mainz]].<ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> \n\n===Administrative responsibilities===\nThe Institute consisted of two departments: Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Physics was [[Josef Mattauch]]'s department, while Nuclear Chemistry was Strassmann's department.  Mattauch was appointed director, but suffered from [[tuberculosis]]. In his absence, Strassman became acting director in 1948. \nAs of 1949, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute was renamed the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]], and moved from Tailfingen to [[Mainz]], [[Germany]].\nIn 1950 Strassmann became its official director.<ref name=\"Chronik\">{{cite web |title=Chronik des Kaiser-Wilhelm- / Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |url=https://www.mpic.de/3557710/Chronik_kompl_kl.pdf |website=Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Palme\">{{cite journal |last1=Palme |first1=Herbert |title=Cosmochemistry along the Rhine |journal=Geochemical Perspectives |date=2018 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4-10 |url=http://www.geochemicalperspectives.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/v7n1.pdf}}</ref>\nAfter Mattauch returned to the institute in 1951, there was considerable conflict over the allocation of resources to their departments.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/> \n\n===Renewed research===\nIn 1953, Strassmann gave up the directorship, choosing instead to focus on his work at the University of Mainz, building up the department and working with students. He began with a few scattered rooms and very little money.  He negotiated with the university and with Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabriken (B.A.S.F.) to fund an institute for the chemical sciences with a focus on nuclear chemistry. He also lobbied the federal government to fund a neutron generator, a research reactor and a special institute for nuclear chemistry.
