This approach views campus sexual assault as primarily the result of individual characteristics possessed by either the perpetrator and/or the victim. For example, Malamuth & Colleagues identified individual characteristics of hostile masculinity and impersonal sexual behavior as critical predictors of sexual aggression against women. Their psychological model states that men who display hostile masculinity traits (e.g. a desire to control/dominate women and an insecure, hypersensitive and distrustful orientation toward women) and impersonal sexual behavior (e.g. an emotionally detached, promiscuous and non-committal orientation towards sexual relations) are more likely to support the use of violence against women and engage in sexual assault. Their findings have been replicated in college student samples and non-student adult samples (Malamuth et al., 1991; Malamuth et al., 1993). Further, narcissistic entitlement and trait aggression have been identified as major individual risk factors for rape (LeBreton et al., 2013). General desire or need for sex, contrary to popular opinion, is not significantly associated with sexual assault indicating that sexual assault is act of dominance rather than sexual gratification (Abbey & McAuslan, 2004). In regards to victims, white women, first-year students, non-students on college campuses, prior victims, and women who are more sexually active are more vulnerable to being sexually assaulted.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Forbes|first=Gordon B.|last2=Adams-Curtis|first2=Leah E. | title = Experiences with sexual coercion in college males and females: Role of family conflict, sexist attitudes, acceptance of rape myths, self-esteem, and the big-five personality factors | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 865\u2013889 | doi = 10.1177/088626001016009002 | date = September 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[rape culture]]\" approach stems from [[second-wave feminism]]<ref>{{Cite book|doi = 10.4135/9781452232065.n4|chapter = Factors Associated with Male Peer Support for Sexual Assault on the College Campus|title = Sexual Assault on the College Campus: The Role of Male Peer Support|pages = [https://archive.org/details/sexualassaultonc0000schw/page/97 97\u2013136]|year = 1997|isbn = 9780803970274|last1 = Schwartz|first1 = Martin D.|last2 = Dekeseredy|first2 = Walter S.|last3 = Dekeseredy|first3 = Walter|url = https://archive.org/details/sexualassaultonc0000schw/page/97}}</ref> and focuses on how rape is pervasive and [[Normalization (sociology)|normalized]] due to societal attitudes about [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sexualization of Childhood|last=Olfman|first=Sharna|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe third approach to explaining rape identifies the contexts in which that rape and sexual assault occur.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Humphrey|first=Stephen E.|last2=Kahn|first2=Arnold S. | title = Fraternities, athletic teams, and rape importance of identification with a risky group | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1313\u20131322 | doi = 10.1177/088626000015012005 | date = December 2000 | ref = harv }}</ref> This approach suggests that, although rape culture is a factor to why sexual assault occurs, it is also the characteristics of its setting that can increase vulnerability.

In March 2015, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence (NAESV) conducted a survey in conjunction with [[Know Your IX]] regarding the right of the survivor to choose to report the assault to police authorities versus legislation which would enforce legal action upon reporting sexual assault to a university or college. \"When asked their concerns if reporting to police were mandatory, 79% said, \"this could have a chilling effect on reporting\", while 72% were concerned that \"survivors would be forced to participate in the criminal justice system/go to trial\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Survivor Survey on Mandatory Reporting|url = http://endsexualviolence.org/where-we-stand/survivor-survey-on-mandatory-reporting|website = endsexualviolence.org|accessdate = 10 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Affirmative consent policies ===\n{{Main|Sexual consent#Yes means yes}}\nIn an effort to police student conduct, some states such as New York and Connecticut and many schools require \"affirmative consent\" (commonly known as \"yes means yes\").  The policies require students to receive ongoing and active consent throughout any sexual encounter.  The policies hold that \"Silence or lack of resistance, in and of itself, does not demonstrate consent\", in a shift away from \"no means no\" to a \"yes means yes\" requirement for sex to be consensual.  Schools can include drug or alcohol intoxication in their considerations of whether a student granted consent under this policy such that a \"drunk\" student cannot give consent.  These policies are challenging to students because non-verbal cues are difficult to interpret and the policies are confusing.<ref name=\"Affirmative1\">{{cite news|last1=Keenan|first1=Sandy|title=Affirmative Consent: Are Students Really Asking?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/education/edlife/affirmative-consent-are-students-really-asking.html|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=The New York Times|date=28 July 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, researchers have found that legal definitions of affirmative consent are not aligned with student understanding and practices.<ref name=\"Affirmative2\">{{cite web|last1=New|first1=Jake|title=It Just Happened|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/02/researchers-argue-affirmative-consent-policies-out-touch-reality|website=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There has also been push-back from the legal community.

The letter expressly forbade the use of the stricter \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard used at some schools previously.\nIn 2014, a survey of college and university assault policies conducted at the request of the U.S. Senate found that more than 40% of schools studied had not conducted a single rape or sexual assault investigation in the past five years, and more than 20% had failed to conduct investigations into assaults they had reported to the Department of Education.<ref name=Mccaskill>{{cite web|title=Sexual Violence on Campus: How too many institutions of higher education are failing to protect students|url=http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/SurveyReportwithAppendix.pdf|publisher=U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Financial & Contracting Oversight|accessdate=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218222957/http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/SurveyReportwithAppendix.pdf|archive-date=18 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The \"Dear Colleague\" letter is credited by victim's advocates with de-stigmatizing sexual assault and encouraging victims to report.

In early 2014, the group [[RAINN]] (Rape and Incest National Network) wrote an open letter to the White House calling for campus hearings to be de-emphasized due to their lack of accountability for survivors and victims of sexual violence. According to RAINN, \"The crime of rape does not fit the capabilities of such boards.

In addition to concerns about legal due process, which colleges currently do not have to abide, the push for stronger punishments and permanent disciplinary records on transcripts can prevent students found responsible from ever completing college or seeking graduate studies.  Even for minor sexual misconduct offenses, the inconsistent and sometimes \"murky\" notes on transcripts can severely limit options. Mary Koss, a University of Arizona professor, co-authored a peer-reviewed paper in 2014 that argues for a \"restorative justice\" response \u2013 which could include counseling, close monitoring, and community service \u2013 would be better than the judicial model most campus hearing panels resemble.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Katie J.M.|title=The Accused|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/accused-men-say-the-system-hurting-college-sexual-assault-su#.pmg9ZyrVX|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=24 July 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome critics of these policies, such as libertarian critics of feminism [[Cathy Young]], [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Laura Kipnis]], have characterized the concerns about sexual assault on college campuses as a [[moral panic]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Cathy|title=The Year the Crusade Against 'Rape Culture' Stumbled|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/12/26/the-year-the-crusade-against-rape-cultur|website=Reason.com|accessdate=8 April 2015|date=26 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rape Culture is a 'Panic Where Paranoia, Censorship, and False Accusations Flourish|url=http://time.com/100091/campus-sexual-assault-christina-hoff-sommers  |accessdate=12 March 2015 | work=Time Magazine | date=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last =Kipnis\n | first =Laura\n | title =Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus\n | publisher =Harper\n | date =2017\n | pages =256\n | url =http://laurakipnis.com/books/unwanted-advances/\n | isbn =978-0062657862 }}</ref>\n\n==== Lawsuits ====\nSince the issuance of the \"Dear Colleague\" letter, a number of lawsuits have been filed against colleges and universities by male students alleging that their universities violated their rights over the course of adjudicating sexual assault accusations.<ref name = \"Schow\">Schow, Ashe, \"[http://washingtonexaminer.com/backlash-college-men-challenge-guilty-until-proven-innocent-standard-for-sex-assault-cases/article/2551863 Backlash: College men challenge 'guilty until proven innocent' standard for sex assault cases]\", ''[[Washington Examiner]]'', 11 August 2014 | Other Sources:\n*{{cite journal|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/02/11/expelled-swarthmore-student-sues-college-sexual-assault-allegations|last=Van Zuylen-Wood|first=Simon|title=Expelled Swarthmore Student Sues College Over Sexual Assault Allegations|journal=Philadelphia|date=11 February 2014}}\n*{{cite news|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20131217/NEWS01/312170088/DSU-student-who-cleared-rape-charges-sues-school|last=Parra|first=Esteban|title=DSU student who was cleared of rape charges sues school|newspaper=The News Journal|date=17 December 2013}}</ref> [[Xavier University]] entered into a settlement in one such lawsuit in April 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/basketball-star-wells-settles-suit-against-xavier|last=Myers|first=Amanda Lee|title=Basketball star Wells settles suit against Xavier|work=Associated Press|date=24 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n* In October 2014, a male [[Occidental College]] student filed a Title IX complaint against the school after he was expelled for an alleged sexual assault.

Research conducted by Pryor ''et al''. reported that college student definitions of sexual harassment in Germany, Australia, Brazil, and North America vary.

This approach views campus sexual assault as primarily the result of individual characteristics possessed by either the perpetrator and/or the victim. For example, Malamuth & Colleagues identified individual characteristics of hostile masculinity and impersonal sexual behavior as critical predictors of sexual aggression against women. Their psychological model states that men who display hostile masculinity traits (e.g. a desire to control/dominate women and an insecure, hypersensitive and distrustful orientation toward women) and impersonal sexual behavior (e.g. an emotionally detached, promiscuous and non-committal orientation towards sexual relations) are more likely to support the use of violence against women and engage in sexual assault. Their findings have been replicated in college student samples and non-student adult samples (Malamuth et al., 1991; Malamuth et al., 1993). Further, narcissistic entitlement and trait aggression have been identified as major individual risk factors for rape (LeBreton et al., 2013). General desire or need for sex, contrary to popular opinion, is not significantly associated with sexual assault indicating that sexual assault is act of dominance rather than sexual gratification (Abbey & McAuslan, 2004). In regards to victims, white women, first-year students, non-students on college campuses, prior victims, and women who are more sexually active are more vulnerable to being sexually assaulted.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Forbes|first=Gordon B.|last2=Adams-Curtis|first2=Leah E. | title = Experiences with sexual coercion in college males and females: Role of family conflict, sexist attitudes, acceptance of rape myths, self-esteem, and the big-five personality factors | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 865\u2013889 | doi = 10.1177/088626001016009002 | date = September 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[rape culture]]\" approach stems from [[second-wave feminism]]<ref>{{Cite book|doi = 10.4135/9781452232065.n4|chapter = Factors Associated with Male Peer Support for Sexual Assault on the College Campus|title = Sexual Assault on the College Campus: The Role of Male Peer Support|pages = [https://archive.org/details/sexualassaultonc0000schw/page/97 97\u2013136]|year = 1997|isbn = 9780803970274|last1 = Schwartz|first1 = Martin D.|last2 = Dekeseredy|first2 = Walter S.|last3 = Dekeseredy|first3 = Walter|url = https://archive.org/details/sexualassaultonc0000schw/page/97}}</ref> and focuses on how rape is pervasive and [[Normalization (sociology)|normalized]] due to societal attitudes about [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sexualization of Childhood|last=Olfman|first=Sharna|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe third approach to explaining rape identifies the contexts in which that rape and sexual assault occur.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Humphrey|first=Stephen E.|last2=Kahn|first2=Arnold S. | title = Fraternities, athletic teams, and rape importance of identification with a risky group | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1313\u20131322 | doi = 10.1177/088626000015012005 | date = December 2000 | ref = harv }}</ref> This approach suggests that, although rape culture is a factor to why sexual assault occurs, it is also the characteristics of its setting that can increase vulnerability.

The book broadened the perception of rape from a crime by strangers, to one that more often included friends and acquaintances, and raised awareness.

In March 2015, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence (NAESV) conducted a survey in conjunction with [[Know Your IX]] regarding the right of the survivor to choose to report the assault to police authorities versus legislation which would enforce legal action upon reporting sexual assault to a university or college. \"When asked their concerns if reporting to police were mandatory, 79% said, \"this could have a chilling effect on reporting\", while 72% were concerned that \"survivors would be forced to participate in the criminal justice system/go to trial\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Survivor Survey on Mandatory Reporting|url = http://endsexualviolence.org/where-we-stand/survivor-survey-on-mandatory-reporting|website = endsexualviolence.org|accessdate = 10 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Affirmative consent policies ===\n{{Main|Sexual consent#Yes means yes}}\nIn an effort to police student conduct, some states such as New York and Connecticut and many schools require \"affirmative consent\" (commonly known as \"yes means yes\").  The policies require students to receive ongoing and active consent throughout any sexual encounter.  The policies hold that \"Silence or lack of resistance, in and of itself, does not demonstrate consent\", in a shift away from \"no means no\" to a \"yes means yes\" requirement for sex to be consensual.  Schools can include drug or alcohol intoxication in their considerations of whether a student granted consent under this policy such that a \"drunk\" student cannot give consent.  These policies are challenging to students because non-verbal cues are difficult to interpret and the policies are confusing.<ref name=\"Affirmative1\">{{cite news|last1=Keenan|first1=Sandy|title=Affirmative Consent: Are Students Really Asking?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/education/edlife/affirmative-consent-are-students-really-asking.html|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=The New York Times|date=28 July 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, researchers have found that legal definitions of affirmative consent are not aligned with student understanding and practices.<ref name=\"Affirmative2\">{{cite web|last1=New|first1=Jake|title=It Just Happened|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/02/researchers-argue-affirmative-consent-policies-out-touch-reality|website=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There has also been push-back from the legal community.
