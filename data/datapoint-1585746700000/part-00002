His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy becomes a con artist himself, earning the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also runs petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzles]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father dies six months later; Jimmy cries inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy runs into trouble with the police when he drunkenly defecates on a man's car in front of the man's children. Chuck gets him out of trouble, but requires that he work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, when Chuck believes he has [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] and becomes housebound, Jimmy begins bringing him groceries and running errands.\n\nJimmy befriends [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completes his college degree and attends a correspondence law school.  He passes the [[bar exam]] and hopes to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denies Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then starts a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/better-call-saul-season-3-premiere-breaking-bad-1202018973/|title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: Jimmy McGill Gets Closer to \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019|last=Gordon|first=Diane|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street.\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nUnhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy attempts to represent Craig ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) and Betsy Kettleman ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), a couple accused of [[embezzling]] over a million dollars. They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel.  When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping.  Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck that he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store, out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. He also enlists prostitutes to humiliate Howard at a business lunch by pretending that he had availed their services and failed to pay them.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]]. The two marry the next day, with Jimmy promising to be transparent with Kim about his activities. \n\nJimmy is enlisted by Nacho to represent Lalo, who has been charged with murder. Lalo asks Jimmy to secure him bail so that he does not go to trial, adding that Jimmy will be a \"friend of the cartel\" should he succeed. Despite Lalo initially being refused bail, Jimmy reveals that the key witness in the case was coached by a private investigator (Mike had posed as a private investigator under an assumed identity to ensure Lalo would be implicated in the crime, but provides details of this work to Jimmy to guarantee Lalo's release on bail due to his business dealings at the behest of [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), who wants Lalo to be released). The judge sets bail at US$7 million in cash; Lalo tells Jimmy that he has the money, but will need Jimmy to collect it. Concerned, Jimmy is also visibly distressed by the presence of the family of Lalo's victim; he later experiences a public meltdown after being confronted by Howard, who has deduced that Jimmy is behind the recent harassment.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store. These scenes show him reminiscing about his past success in private, but wary of anyone finding out about his previous life in Albuquerque. However, when called out by a taxi driver who recognizes him as Saul, Gene calls up Ed to request another relocation, but then decides mid-call to face the situation himself.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/better-call-saul-is-finally-becoming-breaking-bad|title='Better Call Saul' Is Finally Becoming 'Breaking Bad'|last=Meslow|first=Scott|date=April 10, 2017|work=GQ|access-date=April 19, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-walter-white-alive-cinnabon-omaha/|title='\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Writers: Walter White May Still Be Alive During Gene\u2019s Omaha Cinnabon Scenes|last=Molloy|first=Tim|date=August 8, 2018|work=[[TheWrap]]|access-date=February 2, 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nFor all four seasons of ''Better Call Saul'', Odenkirk was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/emmy-award-nominations-2015-full-list-1201476759/|title=Emmy Nominations 2015 \u2013 Full List|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|date=July 16, 2015|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref> as well as the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]].

First, as White and Pinkman got themselves deeper into the drug business, the show's writers felt they needed a character to be a guide for them.

His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy becomes a con artist himself, earning the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also runs petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzles]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father dies six months later; Jimmy cries inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy runs into trouble with the police when he drunkenly defecates on a man's car in front of the man's children. Chuck gets him out of trouble, but requires that he work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, when Chuck believes he has [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] and becomes housebound, Jimmy begins bringing him groceries and running errands.\n\nJimmy befriends [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completes his college degree and attends a correspondence law school.  He passes the [[bar exam]] and hopes to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denies Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then starts a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/better-call-saul-season-3-premiere-breaking-bad-1202018973/|title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: Jimmy McGill Gets Closer to \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019|last=Gordon|first=Diane|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street.\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nUnhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy attempts to represent Craig ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) and Betsy Kettleman ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), a couple accused of [[embezzling]] over a million dollars. They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel.  When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping.  Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck that he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store, out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. \n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim tells Jimmy that they need to either break up or get married.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.
