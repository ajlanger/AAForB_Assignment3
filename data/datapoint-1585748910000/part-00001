He graduated from the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague. At first he became known as a cartoonist. He began working on animated films in the late 1950s.  In collaboration with directors such as [[B\u0159etislav Pojar]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] and [[Stanislav L\u00e1tal]], he designed cartoon and puppet films. In 1963 Pitra emigrated to Canada. He lived in the USA since the mid-1960s.\n\n== Life and work in Czechoslovakia 1923\u20131963 ==\n'''Svatopluk Pitra''' was born 9 March 1923 in the small village of [[\u0160t\u011bnec]] (now part of [[Jeni\u0161ovice (Chrudim District)|Jeni\u0161ovice]]). His childhood was spent in a former mill with his mother's parents. In 1929 he moved to [[Pod\u011bbrady]] along with his mother and older brother Bohumil, where he started attending elementary school. Even many years later he could still remember his first school assignment: drawing six rows of vertical lines that gradually transformed into ones.<ref>PITRA, Svatopluk. Vlastn\u00ed \u017eivotopis.

Due to poor grades, in fourth year he had to leave for a two-year Amelioration School, which he successfully completed. During his two years of military service in the years 1945 to 1947 he was assigned to the cartographers. Subsequently, he went to work at the Pipe Rolling Mill in Chomutov as a technical draughtsman. As a reward for discovering an error in technical documentation, he received a recommendation for university studies in 1951 <ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba. Svatopluk Pitra.

He was just as masterful in handling lettering, which he placed in his drawings in the form of various signs and labels. Pitra admired the drawings of [[Franti\u0161ek Bidlo]] and above all the portrait shorthand of his professor [[Adolf Hoffmeister]], for whom the medium was a \"mask that is truer than the face\".<ref>HOFFMEISTER, Adolf.

Originally, professor [[Adolf Hoffmeister|Hoffmeister]] himself was to appear in the former [[Topi\u010d\u016fv salon]] vystoupit i s\u00e1m profesor [[Adolf Hoffmeister|Hoffmeister]], but in complete secrecy he relinquished the whole space to his two students. He introduced them at the opening for the show Caricature and Other Unpleasantries as a new hope for Czech humorous drawing, which in his words was wasting away in the shroud of the magazine [[Dikobraz (\u010dasopis)|Dikobraz]].<ref>HOFFMEISTER, Adolf (1957), s. 9.</ref> At the exhibition Pitra displayed cartoons and photo montages, clips from his graduate animated film ''Klobouk ve k\u0159ov\u00ed''[Hat in the Bushes], anti-war and advertising posters, and designs for record sleeves and book covers.<ref>Katalogov\u00fd list k v\u00fdstav\u011b Karikatury a jin\u00e9 nep\u0159\u00edjemnosti Svatopluka Pitry a Vratislava Hlavat\u00e9ho v galerii \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9ho spisovatele v Praze v kv\u011btnu 1957.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pitra_plakat_vystava_1957.jpg|right|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, poster for the exhibition Caricature and Other Unpleasantries by Svatopluk Pitra and Vratislav Hlavat\u00fd, 1957.

After completing school, Pitra began to work as a graphic designer for domestic and international trade fairs; among other things, he participated in the graphic design for the Czechoslovak pavilion at the [[Expo 58|EXPO 58 World's Fair in Brussels]]. Much like his schoolmate Ladislav Rada, he also designed advertisements, posters and record covers for [[Supraphon|Gramofonov\u00e9 z\u00e1vody \u2013 Supraphon]].\n\n[[File:Pitra Tanecni melodie Supraphon 1960.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, artwork for poster Dance Melodies on Gramophone Records for Supraphon, tempera, paper, 70 \u00d7 100 cm, 1960.

Up against more than eight hundred participants, the jury<ref>Adolf Hoffmeister, Zdenek Seydl a grafik Liter\u00e1rn\u00edch novin Ji\u0159\u00ed Schmidt</ref> found Pitra's satirical drawings to be the most interesting, \"artistically clear, almost cruelly exact\".<ref>V\u00fdsledky sout\u011b\u017ee liter\u00e1rn\u00edch novin.

Cartoonists were abandoning illustrated anecdotes and wordy civic satire, ceasing to use dialogues and even monologue captions and began exploring the possibilities of semantically encoding the drawing itself. Some invented sharp-witted absurdities, others sought out a universal language in the tangled world of lines.<ref>RY\u0160KA, Pavel a \u0160R\u00c1MEK, Jan (2016), s. 78\u201383.</ref>\nForeign-policy and anti-fascist caricature had considerable prestige in the official art scene. Svatopluk Pitra took part in a large show of anti-war drawings and collages called To Be or Not To Be, organised in 1961 for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, along with [[Adolf Born]], [[Old\u0159ich Jel\u00ednek]], [[Miroslav Li\u010f\u00e1k]], Vladim\u00edr Hlav\u00edn, [[Vladim\u00edr Jir\u00e1nek]], V\u00e1clav Kab\u00e1t, [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Kalousek]], [[Milan Kop\u0159iva]], [[Jaroslav Mal\u00e1k]], [[Zden\u011bk M\u00e9zl]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160alamoun]], Franti\u0161k Sk\u00e1la sr., [[Bohumil \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Toman]], Josef \u017demli\u010dka, Ji\u0159\u00ed \u017dentel and [[Jaroslav Weigel]].\n\nDrawing was to \"work with poetic metaphors like poetry, conflicts like drama, and sequencing surprising contrasts and contexts like a film montage\".<ref>HA\u010e\u00c1K.

Though he draws very beautiful women, they are all actually beasts [...]. Pitra treats the other half of the population, men, even worse. I don't know a single drawing of Pitra's that depicts a model husband, a good father and breadwinner of a nice family. On the other hand Pitra has depicted a plethora of fraudsters, cardsharps, gangsters, corrupt politicians, detectives and the oddest of individuals.\"<ref>MAL\u00c1K, Jaroslav.

In HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 36\u201337.</ref>\nWe can find a whole gallery of such characters in Pitra's illustrations for the detective stories by [[Alexandr Grin]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [http://www.databazeknih.cz/zivotopis/seico-macumoto-8145 Sei\u010d\u00f3 Macumota] and [[Georges Simenon]], that came out in the year 1962 in the seventh annual revue Sv\u011btov\u00e1 literatura [World Literature].\n\nAnother frequent motif of Pitra's drawings was vehicles: motorcycles, cars, planes or helicopters. He shared this admiration for modern technology with his peers Dobroslav Foll or [[Teodor Rotrekl]], who formed the core of the artistic group Radar<ref>FORM\u00c1NEK, V\u00e1clav. ''Radar. Anatomie tv\u016fr\u010d\u00ed skupiny''. Praha: Odeon, 1971.</ref> along with other [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]] classmates at the end of the fifties. For Pitra, however, the interest in human nature predominated. This is also evident in his drawings for ''Eternity Lost'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] the anthology ''Labyrint'' (SNKLU, 1962), organised by [[Adolf Hoffmeister]]. At the time when this remarkable collection of western science-fiction stories came out, Pitra was already fully involved in artistic design for animated and puppet films at the studio [[Brat\u0159i v triku]].\n\n== Animated film designer 1957\u20131963 ==\n[[File:Tucet mych tatinku 1959 1.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, character of father-photographer for animated film by Eduard Hofman Tucet m\u00fdch tat\u00ednk\u016f [My Dozen Dads] (1959).]]\n\nPitra's first animated films were made at the advertising business Propag, where he designed puppets for a piece by director Josef Kluge on family shopping at department stores ''V\u00e1noce (Christmas)'' (1957). He also drew and self-directed ''Atomic Century (Timely Purchase of Fuel)'' (1957). He is also listed as designer and director for the advertising pieces ''An Idea from Heaven'' (1957) a ''That's Not How It's Done'' (1957), which promoted the advantages of newly introduced self-service retail.<ref>HAVELKA, Ji\u0159\u00ed. \u010cs. filmov\u00e9 hospod\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed III.

For this \"tragic cartoon\", Pitra designed the character of the photographer dad. Aside from the director [[Eduard Hofman]], himself, who drew the character of the policeman, the artists were, [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] (scuba diver), Franti\u0161ek Freiwillig (ship's captain), Vladim\u00edr Hlavat\u00fd (lifeguard), [[Adolf Hoffmeister]] (scientist), [[Ota Jane\u010dek]] (drummer), [[Josef K\u00e1brt]] (opera singer), Jaroslav K\u00e1ndl (painter), Vladim\u00edr Lehk\u00fd (student), [[Kamil Lhot\u00e1k]] (pilot), [[Jaroslav Mal\u00e1k]] (hairdresser) a [[Zden\u011bk Miler]] (little girl and mother).<ref>HAVELKA, Ji\u0159\u00ed. \u010cs. filmov\u00e9 hospod\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed VII. 1958\u20131962.

This morality play on the consequences of irresponsible behaviour received an award at the International Festival in Venice. Pitra did not however receive the travel permit that would allow him to receive the prize in person.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 13.</ref>\n\nPitra designed 2D and 3D puppets for director  [[B\u0159etislav Pojar]] ''Jak za\u0159\u00edditi byt (How to Furnish a Flat)'' (1959). In the short introduction the piece amusingly summarises the prehistory and history of furniture culture, subsequently promoting rational placement of modern home furnishings.\n\nPitra also took part as a designer in [[B\u0159etislav Pojar]] and [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] movie ''Sl\u00e1va (Fame)'' (1959). The story about a chimney that did not smoke just for its own sake, but actually artistically, was situated in a Western-style major city that was supposed to lie far beyond the borders of socialist Czechoslovakia, but can be read as an illustration of the famous proverb about the impermanence of every worldly glory.\n\n[[File:Pitra Plivnik 1961.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, puppets for director Stanislav L\u00e1tal's animated film Plivn\u00edk dla\u017edi\u010de Housky (Tile-Setter Houska's Chicken-Imp), 1961.]]\n\nIn comparison with the highly ironic caricatures of snobbish consumers of artistic sensations, the puppets that he designed for Bohuslav \u0160r\u00e1mek's animated film  ''P\u0161tros (Ostrich)'' (1960), were much more benevolent. Also pleasantly rounded were the figures of the puppet film ''Plivn\u00edk dla\u017edi\u010de Housky'' (1961), based on the eponymous story by [[Karel Michal]]<ref>MICHAL, Karel. Plivn\u00edk dla\u017edi\u010de Housky. Plamen. 1959, \u010d. 3.</ref> and filmed by director [[Stanislav L\u00e1tal]]. The disposition of the individual characters was rounded out inimitably by the voice of [[Rudolf Deyl, jr.]], who convincingly portrayed Houska's indecisive resignation, the self-satisfied pedantry of the enterprise officials, and the chicken-imp's maniacal energy. Pitra's artistic design for the film  ''Cecilie 470'' (1961), which director Jan Karpa\u0161 filmed based on the story by [[Milo\u0161 Macourek]], was characterised by an elegant painting of stylish \"Brussels\" graphics. Pitra used a similar artistic concept in the animated film by director Bohuslava \u0160r\u00e1mka ''Blecha (Flea)'' (1961) about an insignificant creature obsessed with a megalomaniacal delusion.\n\nSvatopluk Pitra, who at the time was quite overworked, suffered a legitimate feeling of insufficient appreciation. He bore the contrast between his abilities and their pitiful financial reward just as hard as his exhausting and vain search for his own studio.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 16.</ref> After the propaganda piece ''T\u0159i mu\u017ei na ryb\u00e1ch (Three Men Fishing)'' (1962), pointing out the advantages of working in shifts, the last film Pitra worked on in Czechoslovakia was an awareness piece by director and screenwriter [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] ''Tak na to? (So Shall We?)''. When the imaginative and humorous film about the need to observe good habits when losing weight reached Czech cinemas in mid-1963, the artist's name was not even mentioned in the credits.\n\n== The American years 1963\u20131993 ==\n\n[[File:Pitra kresba Pan Chruscov 1963.jpg|right|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, drawing Pan Chru\u0161\u010dov (Mr Krushchev), 1963.]]\n\nThe reason was that in spring of 1963, Pitra took advantage of a trip to [[Cuba]] that [[Czechoslovak Television|\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 televize]] and [[Short Film|Kr\u00e1tk\u00fd film]], had arranged for creative employees and, on the return during a stopover in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], he applied for political asylum. The successful and confident forty-year-old graphic designer had no doubt he would make his way in this new environment just as well as he had in Czechoslovakia. The beginnings were indeed promising. Pitra found work in the government production and distribution company the [[National Film Board of Canada]] as a creator of advertising and promotional films. Of course he only accepted this well paid employment as a temporary solution until he could learn English and get a permit to travel to the [[United States of America|USA]].\nHe was particularly happy with having his own home and also with the enormous amount of cheap jazz records. Though at night he dreamed of wild chases with Prague cops, he felt finally free. He started working on the animated film ''The Kind Dictator (Laskav\u00fd dikt\u00e1tor)'', the idea for which he wanted to pitch to a Canadian or American producer. At the time he sent his girlfriend and former classmate from [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]] [http://expo58.blogspot.cz/2012/12/osudovy-klub-supraphonu.html Irena Bryndov\u00e1] in Prague a drawing on which \"Mr [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\" is approaching the naked buttocks of a chained victim with a syringe.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 15.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pitra skica The Kind Dictator.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, sketch for film The Kind Dictator, undated (mid-60s).]]\n\nIn light of the difficult pronunciation of the name Svatopluk, while living in Canada he began to sign his name S. Paul Pitra. Later he would sign his work with ART-TIP, a play on words with the ananym of his surname. In Prague he was meanwhile convicted of illegal border crossing and sentenced to three years prison and forfeiture of property. The work that the [[StB|State Security authorities]] confiscated at the time is missing today. \nIn July 1964 he received a permit to live in the United States. Much like [http://www.terryhoponozky.cz/plakaty/parametr-1-autori/1754-fuka-vladimir Vladim\u00edr Fuka], whose first visit to New York thrilled him and inspired a number of drawings, Pitra also considered the American metropolis a place where the maddening maze of obstructions would finally lead out into the free world. It was however a world with quite different rules and some of them he was unable to grasp. Though he admired American automobiles, he had no understanding for mass production in what he considered art. He was shocked by certain expressions of American popular culture and in one letter to Irena Bryndova he complained: \"The locals are on the level of natives in central Africa! What they like the most is things that shine or glitter!\"<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s 23</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1965 he attempted to employ his strongly expressive style of drawing in a competition to decorate the airport in Buffalo. For the forty-metre concrete surface he proposed a figure with a tall top hat and flag of the United States. Though he did not succeed with this idea, at the end of the same year he won a contract for graphic work for the [[1967 International and Universal Exposition]] in Montreal. Though the job brought him his coveted means of subsistence, it did not manage to satisfy his artistic ambitions. It was no different in his next job with greeting card company Hallmark, where he could apply his exceptional spatial imagination and technical gifts in designing three-dimensional paper models of vehicles that were folded up as cards and stood up when unfolded.\n\nIn his free time he made puppets and props for animated films, which he wanted to start working on under more auspicious conditions. But even his patented design for a method of parking cars in tight spaces did not help him acquire a greater financial sum that would allow him to realise film projects. \"The granted patent protected (Pitra's) invention for a period of twenty years, up until 1988. It was to be expected that an automaker would express interest in utilising it in practice. But it did not happen. Only in 2005 did automaker Nissan publish a description of an almost identical design in Japan...\"<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s 33</ref>\n\n[[File:Pitra Zamysleni 1981.jpg|right|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, Zamy\u0161len\u00ed [Contemplation], oil, 53 \u00d7 34.5&nbsp;cm, 1981.]]\n\nAfter five years of waiting for a permit to travel abroad, Pitra's partner Irena Bryndov\u00e1 came to New York at the start of August 1968. They planned to return to Prague together, but this definitively fell apart following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. With the prospect of long-term residence in the United States, Irena Bryndov\u00e1 found work as a fabric designer and in October 1969 was married to Svatopluk Pitra.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s 31</ref>\n\nThough Pitra did not give up on his ideas to create animated films, he could not find a producer for his projects. For this reason he had an animation camera brought in from Vienna and in his New York apartment he created a tripod and electrical control for it. Work constantly ran up against a lack of funding and the film ''The Kind Dictator'' remained unfinished. All that remained in the artist's estate was a typewritten script and several drawings.\n\nAfter ten years living in America, Svatopluk Pitra began to face the consequences of long-untreated [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. Though he did not stop drawing, he no longer published the results of his work. Aside from colourful drawings, which he did not first exhibit until the start of the nineties in Prague, he also began painting. He was again most interested by figural motifs; this time they were muted colour figures that often fixed their gaze directly at the viewer. Still lifes and nostalgic looks back at the distant Czech landscape also appeared in his paintings. While at the end of the fifties he constructed sharp verticals of high-rise buildings, among New York's skyscrapers he painted winding streets lined with buildings with red gabled roofs.\n\nPitra was allowed to visit Czechoslovakia as a citizen of the United States in 1976. He only had his first improvised exhibition, organised by his friends from Polylegran [[Jaroslav Mal\u00e1k]] and former graphic designer of [[Mlad\u00fd sv\u011bt]] [[Jaroslav Weigel]], in the newsroom of Mlad\u00e1 fronta, after the fall of the communist regime in 1991.<ref>MAL\u00c1K, Jaroslav.

He graduated from the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague. At first he became known as a cartoonist. He began working on animated films in the late 1950s.  In collaboration with directors such as [[B\u0159etislav Pojar]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] and [[Stanislav L\u00e1tal]], he designed cartoon and puppet films.

His childhood was spent in a former mill with his mother's parents. In 1929 he moved to [[Pod\u011bbrady]] along with his mother and older brother Bohumil, where he started attending elementary school.

During his two years of military service in the years 1945 to 1947 he was assigned to the cartographers. Subsequently, he went to work at the Pipe Rolling Mill in Chomutov as a technical draughtsman. As a reward for discovering an error in technical documentation, he received a recommendation for university studies in 1951 <ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba. Svatopluk Pitra.

He was just as masterful in handling lettering, which he placed in his drawings in the form of various signs and labels. Pitra admired the drawings of [[Franti\u0161ek Bidlo]] and above all the portrait shorthand of his professor [[Adolf Hoffmeister]], for whom the medium was a \"mask that is truer than the face\".<ref>HOFFMEISTER, Adolf.

After completing school, Pitra began to work as a graphic designer for domestic and international trade fairs; among other things, he participated in the graphic design for the Czechoslovak pavilion at the [[Expo 58|EXPO 58 World's Fair in Brussels]].

Cartoonists were abandoning illustrated anecdotes and wordy civic satire, ceasing to use dialogues and even monologue captions and began exploring the possibilities of semantically encoding the drawing itself. Some invented sharp-witted absurdities, others sought out a universal language in the tangled world of lines.<ref>RY\u0160KA, Pavel a \u0160R\u00c1MEK, Jan (2016), s. 78\u201383.</ref>\nForeign-policy and anti-fascist caricature had considerable prestige in the official art scene. Svatopluk Pitra took part in a large show of anti-war drawings and collages called To Be or Not To Be, organised in 1961 for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, along with [[Adolf Born]], [[Old\u0159ich Jel\u00ednek]], [[Miroslav Li\u010f\u00e1k]], Vladim\u00edr Hlav\u00edn, [[Vladim\u00edr Jir\u00e1nek]], V\u00e1clav Kab\u00e1t, [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Kalousek]], [[Milan Kop\u0159iva]], [[Jaroslav Mal\u00e1k]], [[Zden\u011bk M\u00e9zl]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160alamoun]], Franti\u0161k Sk\u00e1la sr., [[Bohumil \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Toman]], Josef \u017demli\u010dka, Ji\u0159\u00ed \u017dentel and [[Jaroslav Weigel]].\n\nDrawing was to \"work with poetic metaphors like poetry, conflicts like drama, and sequencing surprising contrasts and contexts like a film montage\".<ref>HA\u010e\u00c1K.

Though he draws very beautiful women, they are all actually beasts [...]. Pitra treats the other half of the population, men, even worse. I don't know a single drawing of Pitra's that depicts a model husband, a good father and breadwinner of a nice family. On the other hand Pitra has depicted a plethora of fraudsters, cardsharps, gangsters, corrupt politicians, detectives and the oddest of individuals.\"<ref>MAL\u00c1K, Jaroslav. Vzpom\u00ednkov\u00fd text. In HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 36\u201337.</ref>\nWe can find a whole gallery of such characters in Pitra's illustrations for the detective stories by [[Alexandr Grin]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [http://www.databazeknih.cz/zivotopis/seico-macumoto-8145 Sei\u010d\u00f3 Macumota] and [[Georges Simenon]], that came out in the year 1962 in the seventh annual revue Sv\u011btov\u00e1 literatura [World Literature].\n\nAnother frequent motif of Pitra's drawings was vehicles: motorcycles, cars, planes or helicopters. He shared this admiration for modern technology with his peers Dobroslav Foll or [[Teodor Rotrekl]], who formed the core of the artistic group Radar<ref>FORM\u00c1NEK, V\u00e1clav. ''Radar. Anatomie tv\u016fr\u010d\u00ed skupiny''. Praha: Odeon, 1971.</ref> along with other [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]] classmates at the end of the fifties. For Pitra, however, the interest in human nature predominated. This is also evident in his drawings for ''Eternity Lost'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] the anthology ''Labyrint'' (SNKLU, 1962), organised by [[Adolf Hoffmeister]]. At the time when this remarkable collection of western science-fiction stories came out, Pitra was already fully involved in artistic design for animated and puppet films at the studio [[Brat\u0159i v triku]].\n\n== Animated film designer 1957\u20131963 ==\n[[File:Tucet mych tatinku 1959 1.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, character of father-photographer for animated film by Eduard Hofman Tucet m\u00fdch tat\u00ednk\u016f [My Dozen Dads] (1959).]]\n\nPitra's first animated films were made at the advertising business Propag, where he designed puppets for a piece by director Josef Kluge on family shopping at department stores ''V\u00e1noce (Christmas)'' (1957). He also drew and self-directed ''Atomic Century (Timely Purchase of Fuel)'' (1957). He is also listed as designer and director for the advertising pieces ''An Idea from Heaven'' (1957) a ''That's Not How It's Done'' (1957), which promoted the advantages of newly introduced self-service retail.<ref>HAVELKA, Ji\u0159\u00ed. \u010cs. filmov\u00e9 hospod\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed III.

For this \"tragic cartoon\", Pitra designed the character of the photographer dad.

This morality play on the consequences of irresponsible behaviour received an award at the International Festival in Venice. Pitra did not however receive the travel permit that would allow him to receive the prize in person.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 13.</ref>\n\nPitra designed 2D and 3D puppets for director  [[B\u0159etislav Pojar]] ''Jak za\u0159\u00edditi byt (How to Furnish a Flat)'' (1959). In the short introduction the piece amusingly summarises the prehistory and history of furniture culture, subsequently promoting rational placement of modern home furnishings.\n\nPitra also took part as a designer in [[B\u0159etislav Pojar]] and [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] movie ''Sl\u00e1va (Fame)'' (1959). The story about a chimney that did not smoke just for its own sake, but actually artistically, was situated in a Western-style major city that was supposed to lie far beyond the borders of socialist Czechoslovakia, but can be read as an illustration of the famous proverb about the impermanence of every worldly glory.\n\n[[File:Pitra Plivnik 1961.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, puppets for director Stanislav L\u00e1tal's animated film Plivn\u00edk dla\u017edi\u010de Housky (Tile-Setter Houska's Chicken-Imp), 1961.]]\n\nIn comparison with the highly ironic caricatures of snobbish consumers of artistic sensations, the puppets that he designed for Bohuslav \u0160r\u00e1mek's animated film  ''P\u0161tros (Ostrich)'' (1960), were much more benevolent. Also pleasantly rounded were the figures of the puppet film ''Plivn\u00edk dla\u017edi\u010de Housky'' (1961), based on the eponymous story by [[Karel Michal]]<ref>MICHAL, Karel. Plivn\u00edk dla\u017edi\u010de Housky. Plamen. 1959, \u010d. 3.</ref> and filmed by director [[Stanislav L\u00e1tal]]. The disposition of the individual characters was rounded out inimitably by the voice of [[Rudolf Deyl, jr.]], who convincingly portrayed Houska's indecisive resignation, the self-satisfied pedantry of the enterprise officials, and the chicken-imp's maniacal energy. Pitra's artistic design for the film  ''Cecilie 470'' (1961), which director Jan Karpa\u0161 filmed based on the story by [[Milo\u0161 Macourek]], was characterised by an elegant paiting of stylish \"Brussels\" graphics. Pitra used a similar artistic concept in the animated film by director Bohuslava \u0160r\u00e1mka ''Blecha (Flea)'' (1961) about an insignificant creature obsessed with a megalomaniacal delusion.\n\nSvatopluk Pitra, who at the time was quite overworked, suffered a legitimate feeling of insufficient appreciation. He bore the contrast between his abilities and their pitiful financial reward just as hard as his exhausting and vain search for his own studio.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 16.</ref> After the propaganda piece ''T\u0159i mu\u017ei na ryb\u00e1ch (Three Men Fishing)'' (1962), pointing out the advantages of working in shifts, the last film Pitra worked on in Czechoslovakia was an awareness piece by director and screenwriter [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Brde\u010dka]] ''Tak na to? (So Shall We?)''. When the imaginative and humorous film about the need to observe good habits when losing weight reached Czech cinemas in mid-1963, the artist's name was not even mentioned in the credits.\n\n== The American years 1963\u20131993 ==\n\n[[File:Pitra kresba Pan Chruscov 1963.jpg|right|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, drawing Pan Chru\u0161\u010dov (Mr Krushchev), 1963.]]\n\nThe reason was that in spring of 1963, Pitra took advantage of a trip to [[Cuba]] that [[Czechoslovak Television|\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 televize]] and [[Short Film|Kr\u00e1tk\u00fd film]], had arranged for creative employees and, on the return during a stopover in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], he applied for political asylum. The successful and confident forty-year-old graphic designer had no doubt he would make his way in this new environment just as well as he had in Czechoslovakia. The beginnings were indeed promising. Pitra found work in the government production and distribution company the [[National Film Board of Canada]] as a creator of advertising and promotional films. Of course he only accepted this well paid employment as a temporary solution until he could learn English and get a permit to travel to the [[United States of America|USA]].\nHe was particularly happy with having his own home and also with the enormous amount of cheap jazz records. Though at night he dreamed of wild chases with Prague cops, he felt finally free. He started working on the animated film ''The Kind Dictator (Laskav\u00fd dikt\u00e1tor)'', the idea for which he wanted to pitch to a Canadian or American producer. At the time he sent his girlfriend and former classmate from [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]] [http://expo58.blogspot.cz/2012/12/osudovy-klub-supraphonu.html Irena Bryndov\u00e1] in Prague a drawing on which \"Mr [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\" is approaching the naked buttocks of a chained victim with a syringe.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s. 15.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pitra skica The Kind Dictator.jpg|left|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, sketch for film The Kind Dictator, undated (mid-60s).]]\n\nIn light of the difficult pronunciation of the name Svatopluk, while living in Canada he began to sign his name S. Paul Pitra. Later he would sign his work with ART-TIP, a play on words with the ananym of his surname. In Prague he was meanwhile convicted of illegal border crossing and sentenced to three years prison and forfeiture of property. The work that the [[StB|State Security authorities]] confiscated at the time is missing today. \nIn July 1964 he received a permit to live in the United States. Much like [http://www.terryhoponozky.cz/plakaty/parametr-1-autori/1754-fuka-vladimir Vladim\u00edr Fuka], whose first visit to New York thrilled him and inspired a number of drawings, Pitra also considered the American metropolis a place where the maddening maze of obstructions would finally lead out into the free world. It was however a world with quite different rules and some of them he was unable to grasp. Though he admired American automobiles, he had no understanding for mass production in what he considered art. He was shocked by certain expressions of American popular culture and in one letter to Irena Bryndova he complained: \"The locals are on the level of natives in central Africa! What they like the most is things that shine or glitter!\"<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s 23</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1965 he attempted to employ his strongly expressive style of drawing in a competition to decorate the airport in Buffalo. For the forty-metre concrete surface he proposed a figure with a tall top hat and flag of the United States. Though he did not succeed with this idea, at the end of the same year he won a contract for graphic work for the [[1967 International and Universal Exposition]] in Montreal. Though the job brought him his coveted means of subsistence, it did not manage to satisfy his artistic ambitions. It was no different in his next job with greeting card company Hallmark, where he could apply his exceptional spatial imagination and technical gifts in designing three-dimensional paper models of vehicles that were folded up as cards and stood up when unfolded.\n\nIn his free time he made puppets and props for animated films, which he wanted to start working on under more auspicious conditions. But even his patented design for a method of parking cars in tight spaces did not help him acquire a greater financial sum that would allow him to realise film projects. \"The granted patent protected (Pitra's) invention for a period of twenty years, up until 1988. It was to be expected that an automaker would express interest in utilising it in practice. But it did not happen. Only in 2005 did automaker Nissan publish a description of an almost identical design in Japan...\"<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s 33</ref>\n\n[[File:Pitra Zamysleni 1981.jpg|right|thumb|Svatopluk Pitra, Zamy\u0161len\u00ed [Contemplation], oil, 53 \u00d7 34.5&nbsp;cm, 1981.]]\n\nAfter five years of waiting for a permit to travel abroad, Pitra's partner Irena Bryndov\u00e1 came to New York at the start of August 1968. They planned to return to Prague together, but this definitively fell apart following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. With the prospect of long-term residence in the United States, Irena Bryndov\u00e1 found work as a fabric designer and in October 1969 was married to Svatopluk Pitra.<ref>HOR\u00c1KOV\u00c1, Ljuba (2007), s 31</ref>\n\nThough Pitra did not give up on his ideas to create animated films, he could not find a producer for his projects. For this reason he had an animation camera brought in from Vienna and in his New York apartment he created a tripod and electrical control for it. Work constantly ran up against a lack of funding and the film ''The Kind Dictator'' remained unfinished. All that remained in the artist's estate was a typewritten script and several drawings.\n\nAfter ten years living in America, Svatopluk Pitra began to face the consequences of long-untreated [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. Though he did not stop drawing, he no longer published the results of his work. Aside from colourful drawings, which he did not first exhibit until the start of the nineties in Prague, he also began painting. He was again most interested by figural motifs; this time they were muted colour figures that often fixed their gaze directly at the viewer. Still lifes and nostalgic looks back at the distant Czech landscape also appeared in his paintings. While at the end of the fifties he constructed sharp verticals of high-rise buildings, among New York's skyscrapers he painted winding streets lined with buildings with red gabled roofs.\n\nPitra was allowed to visit Czechoslovakia as a citizen of the United States in 1976. He only had his first improvised exhibition, organised by his friends from Polylegran [[Jaroslav Mal\u00e1k]] and former graphic designer of [[Mlad\u00fd sv\u011bt]] [[Jaroslav Weigel]], in the newsroom of Mlad\u00e1 fronta, after the fall of the communist regime in 1991.<ref>MAL\u00c1K, Jaroslav.
