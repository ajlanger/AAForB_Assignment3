The tankers were simply too big to fit through the [[Panama Canal]] and would have to take a longer route that traversed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"jstor.org\" />\n\nThe final obstacle to the exportation of oil was a diplomatic one. Since about 60 percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports were going to the United States, Chinese officials were worried that by buying more oil that they would become involved in the disputes between Chavez\u2019s anti-US regime and the [[Presidency of George W.
