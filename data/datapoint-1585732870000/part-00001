She is a published writer and golf broadcaster.\n\n==Early life==\nBaugh was born in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. As a child she won the National PeeWee Golf Championship five times, her first coming at age three. Her parents divorced when she was 11 years old, and she moved with her mother from their Florida home to [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father [[Hale Baugh]], a lawyer, was a very good amateur golfer, who introduced his children to golf at early ages. Lacking the money to pay green fees, she and friends would sneak onto golf courses to play. At age 14 she won her first of two straight Los Angeles Women's City Golf Championships. Her older brother Beau Baugh played professionally for a time. She graduated from high school at the age of 16 with excellent grades. She studied at [[Long Beach City College]] and [[California State University, Long Beach]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015811/1/index.htm |title=Beneath The Glitter |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=May 3, 1999 |accessdate=July 20, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/golden-girl-who-lost-her-lustre-1.80046 |title=Golden girl who lost her lustre |magazine=The Irish Times |date=June 7, 1997 }}</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nIn 1971, at the age of 16, at the [[Atlanta Country Club]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], she defeated Beth Barry, 1 up, in the 36-hole final match to win the [[U.S. Women's Amateur]], becoming the youngest champion in the event's 76-year history to that stage. Her physical appearance brought her considerable publicity, and for 1971 she was chosen as a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' \"[[Times Woman of the Year|Woman of the Year]]\". In 1972 she won ''[[Golf Digest]]'s'' \"Most Beautiful Golfer.\" She made a television commercial for [[Colgate-Palmolive|UltraBrite]] toothpaste that won a [[Clio Awards|Clio Award]]. Baugh was a member of the U.S. teams that won the 1972 [[Curtis Cup]] and the 1972 [[Espirito Santo Trophy]]. Baugh was offered a full academic scholarship to [[Stanford University]], but she declined because Stanford did not have a women's golf team.\n\n==Professional career==\nShe turned professional in 1973 and after signing with the [[International Management Group]], soon had lucrative contracts with Ford, Rolex, Suzuki, The Ladies Home Journal, Wilson, Bermuda's Tourist Bureau and Colgate Palmolive. She had not yet turned 18 so she was ineligible to join the [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]], but she was eligible to play in Japan. She played several pro events in Japan, where her appearance attracted immense interest and publicity. \n\nShe earned her LPGA Tour card on her first attempt in [[1973 LPGA Tour|1973]], and the very next week placed second in her Tour debut. She earned 1973 [[LPGA#LPGA Tour awards|Rookie of the Year]] honors.\n\nDuring her professional golf career from 1973 through 2001, Baugh earned 71 top-10 finishes, including ten runners-up. She earned significant prize money, and supplemented this with even greater earnings from endorsements and golf outings, after signing with the [[International Management Group]] upon turning professional. She has also worked as a television announcer for [[The Golf Channel]].\n\nShe became a member of the [[Legends Tour|The Legends Tour]], formerly known as the Women's Senior Golf Tour, was part of the process to make the [[U.S. Senior Women's Open|U.S. Senior Women\u2019s Open]] a reality and played in the 2018 inaugural event at the [[Chicago Golf Club]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://pontevedrarecorder.com/stories/when-it-comes-to-golf-laura-baugh-is-continually-learning-and-teaching,9016 |title=When it comes to golf, Laura Baugh is continually learning \u2014 and teaching |magazine=Ponte Vedra Recorder |date=May 16, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Privat life==\nBaugh has been married four times, in her second and third marriage (divorced in 1985 but remarried two years later) to [[PGA Tour]] winner [[Bobby Cole (golfer)|Bobby Cole]], the father of her seven children, including professional golfer [[Eric Cole (golfer)|Eric Cole]], who has played on the [[Korn Ferry Tour]] since 2016.\n\nDespite her successful start and prodigious talent, alcoholism and emotional problems took over her life, and she never won an LPGA tournament. Her drinking caused spontaneous bleeding that could have ended her life, had she not sought treatment that included time at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in 1996. She described her battle with alcohol in a 1999 book titled \"''Out of the Rough''.\"\n\nAfter 25 years living in Orlando, Florida, Baugh moved to Augusta, Georgia, in 2013 and to Ponte Vedra, Florida in 2016, to serve as a golf instructor at Sawgrass Country Club.\n\n==Amateur wins==\n*1971 [[United States Women's Amateur Golf Championship|U.S. Women's Amateur Championship]]\n\n==Playoff record==\n'''LPGA Tour playoff record (0\u20131)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponents!!Result\n|-style=\"background:#F5DEB3;\"\n|1\n|[[1979 LPGA Tour|1979]]\n|[[Mayflower Classic]]\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Judy Rankin]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Hollis Stacy]]\n|Stacy won with par on second extra hole<br>Rankin eliminated with par on first hole\n|}\n\n==Team appearances==\n'''Amateur'''\n*[[Curtis Cup]] (representing the United States): 1972 (winners)\n*[[Espirito Santo Trophy]] (representing the United States): 1972 (winners)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Out of the Rough : An Intimate Portrait of Laura Baugh and Her Sobering Journey'' by Laura Baugh and [[Steve Eubanks]], with a [[Foreword]] by [[Arnold Palmer]].
