The Austrians had fortified the mountains {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} ahead of the Italians' entry into the war on 23 May 1915.\n\nItalian Chief of Staff [[Luigi Cadorna]] judged that Italian gains (from Gorizia to [[Trieste]]) were most feasible at the coastal plain east of the lower end of the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo). However he also believed that the Italian army could strike further north and bypass the mountains on either side of the river so as to come at the Austro-Hungarian forces from the rear.\n\nCadorna had not expected operations in the Isonzo sector to be easy. He was well aware that the river was prone to flooding \u2014 and indeed there were record rainfalls during 1914\u201318.\n\nFurther, when attacking further north the Italian army was faced with something of a dilemma: in order to cross the Isonzo safely it needed to neutralise the Austro-Hungarian defenders on the mountains above, yet to neutralise these forces the Italian forces needed first to cross the river \u2014 an obstacle that the Italians never succeeded in overcoming.\n\nIn the south (along the coastal zone) geographic peculiarities, including an array of ridges and valleys, also gave an advantage to the Austro-Hungarian defenders.\n\n==Casualties==\n[[file:\u00dcberschiffung von Truppen \u00fcber den Jsonzo bei Canziano 31.11.17.

Half of the entire Italian war death total \u2014 some 300,000 of 600,000 \u2014 were suffered along the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo).

Austro-Hungarian losses, while by no means as numerous, were nevertheless high at around 200,000 (of an overall total of around 1.2&nbsp;million casualties).<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/isonzo.htm FirstWorldWar.Com ''The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17.'']</ref>\n\nMore than 30,000 casualties were ethnic Slovenes, the majority of them being drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], while Slovene civilian inhabitants from the [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] region also suffered in many thousands because they were resettled in [[refugee camps]] where Slovene refugees were treated as state enemies by Italians, and some thousands died of malnutrition in Italian refugee camps.<ref>Petra Svolj\u0161ak, ''Slovenski begunci v Italiji med prvo svetovno vojno'' (Ljubljana 1991).</ref>\n\n==Number of battles==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-073-25, Isonzo-Schlacht, Trainkolonne am Moistroka-Pass.jpg|thumb|22opx|Austro-Hungarian supply line over the [[Vr\u0161i\u010d Pass]]. October 1917]]\n\nWith almost continuous combat in the area, the precise number of battles forming the Isonzo campaign is debatable. Some historians have assigned distinct names to a couple of the Isonzo struggles, most notably at [[Kobarid]] (Caporetto) in October 1917, which would otherwise form the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo.\n\nThe fact that the battles were always named after the Isonzo River, even in Italy, was considered by some a propaganda success for Austria-Hungary: it highlighted the repeated Italian failure to breach this landmark frontier of the Empire.<ref>Isonzo 1917, Sivestri</ref>\n\nThe Isonzo campaign comprised the following battles:\n\n*[[First Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 23 June\u20137 July 1915\n*[[Second Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 18 July\u20133 August 1915\n*[[Third Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 18 October\u20133 November 1915\n*[[Fourth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 10 November\u20132 December 1915\n*[[Fifth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 9\u201317 March 1916\n*[[Sixth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 6\u201317 August 1916\n*[[Seventh Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 14\u201317 September 1916\n*[[Eighth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 10\u201312 October 1916\n*[[Ninth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 1\u20134 November 1916\n*[[Tenth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 12 May\u20138 June 1917\n*[[Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 19 August\u201312 September 1917\n*[[Battle of Caporetto|Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo]] \u2013 24 October\u20137 November 1917, also known as the Battle of Caporetto\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ ''Brief summary of Isonzo battles''\n|-\n!Battle\n!Dates\n!Italian casualties\n!Austro-Hungarian casualties\n!Outcome\n|-\n|[[First Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 23 June \u2013 7 July 1915\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 15,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 10,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Austro-Hungarian victory\n|-\n|[[Second Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|18 July - 3 August 1915\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 41,800\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 46,600\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Italian victory\n|-\n|[[Third Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 18 October \u2013 3 November 1915\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 66,998\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 41,847\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Austro-Hungarian victory\n|-\n|[[Fourth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 November \u2013 2 December 1915\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 49,500\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 32,100\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Austro-Hungarian victory\n|- \n|[[Fifth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 9\u201315 March 1916\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 1,882 \n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 1,985 \n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Inconclusive\n|-\n|[[Sixth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 6 August \u2013 17 August 1916\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 51,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 42,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Italian victory\n|-\n|[[Seventh Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 14 September \u2013 18 September 1916\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 17,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 15,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Inconclusive\n|-\n|[[Eighth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 October 1916 \u2013 12 October 1916\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 55,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 38,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Inconclusive\n|-\n|[[Ninth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 31 October \u2013 4 November 1916\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 39,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 33,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Italian victory\n|-\n|[[Tenth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 May \u2013 8 June 1917\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 150,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 75,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Limited Italian advance\n|-\n|[[Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 18 August \u2013 12 September 1917\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 158,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 115,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Italian victory\n|-\n|[[Battle of Caporetto|Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo]]\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| 24 October \u2013 19 November 1917\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 305,000\n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 70,000\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Decisive Austro-Hungarian victory;
