The half-life after intramuscular injection is approximately half an hour, so even administered this way, it has limited use as a therapeutic agent.  The metabolically active forms of GLP-1 are the [[endogenous]] GLP-1-(7-36)NH<sub>2</sub> and the more rare GLP-1-(7-37). The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a [[fatty acid]] molecule at one position of the GLP-1-(7-37) molecule, enabling it to both self-associate and bind to [[albumin]] within the [[subcutaneous tissue]] and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Albumin binding also results in slower degradation and reduced [[renal]] elimination compared to that of GLP-1-(7-37).<ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Brand names===\nLiraglutide is marketed under the brand name Victoza in the U.S., U.K. UAE, Kuwait, India, Iran, Canada, Europe and Japan.

This insulin secretion subsides as glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia (normal blood glucose level). It also decreases [[glucagon]] secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and delays [[gastric]] emptying. Unlike [[endogenous]] GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against [[metabolic]] degradation by [[peptidase]]s, with a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] half-life of 13 hours.<ref name=\"drugs.com\">https://www.drugs.com/nda/liraglutide_080530.html May 2008</ref><ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\nEndogenous GLP-1 has a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[half-life]] of 1.5\u20132 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous [[enzymes]], [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] (DPP4) and [[neutral endopeptidase]]s (NEP).  The half-life after intramuscular injection is approximately half an hour, so even administered this way, it has limited use as a therapeutic agent.  The metabolically active forms of GLP-1 are the [[endogenous]] GLP-1-(7-36)NH<sub>2</sub> and the more rare GLP-1-(7-37). The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a [[fatty acid]] molecule at one position of the GLP-1-(7-37) molecule, enabling it to both self-associate and bind to [[albumin]] within the [[subcutaneous tissue]] and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Albumin binding also results in slower degradation and reduced [[renal]] elimination compared to that of GLP-1-(7-37).<ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Brand names===\nLiraglutide is marketed under the brand name Victoza in the U.S., U.K. UAE, Kuwait, India, Iran, Canada, Europe and Japan.
