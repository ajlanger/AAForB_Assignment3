Various branches of this family developed over the centuries and ruled counties with [[Imperial immediacy]].\n\nMost of these counties were annexed by the [[First French Republic]] in 1793, after French troops conquered the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]] during the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Several family branches subsequently received secularized [[abbey]]s as compensation, but shortly afterwards, these new counties were [[German mediatization|mediatized]] and the family lost its immediacy. Today, the only existing branch is that of the [[Prince of Leiningen|Princes of Leiningen]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Codex Manesse Friedrich von Leiningen.jpg|thumb|Count Frederick II (d. 1237)]]\nThe first [[count]] of Leiningen about whom anything definite is known was a certain [[#Earliest Counts|Emich II]] (d. before 1138). He (and perhaps his father Emich I) built [[Altleiningen Castle|Leiningen Castle]], which is now known as \"Old Leiningen Castle\" (German: ''Burg Altleiningen''), around 1100 to 1110. Nearby H\u00f6ningen Abbey was then built around 1120 as the family's burial place.\n\nThis family became extinct in the male line when Count Frederick I died about 1220. Frederick I's sister, Liutgarde, married [[Simon II, Count of Saarbr\u00fccken]]. One of Liutgarde's sons, also named Frederick, inherited the lands of the counts of Leiningen, and he took their arms and their name as Frederick II (d. 1237). He became known as a ''[[Minnesinger]]'', and one of his songs was included in the [[Codex Manesse]]. Before 1212, he built himself a new castle called [[Hardenburg (Bad D\u00fcrkheim)|Hardenburg]], about 10 kilometers south of Altleiningen. This was outside the county of Leiningen on the territory of [[Limburg Abbey]], of which his uncle was the overlord (''[[Vogt]]''), which caused some trouble. \n\nHis eldest son, Simon (c. 1204\u20131234), married Gertrude, heiress of the [[County of Dagsburg]], bringing that property into the family. They had no children and Simon's two brothers inherited the county of Leiningen together: Frederick III (d. 1287) also inherited Dagsburg and Emich IV (d. c. 1276) [[Landeck Castle (Palatinate)|Landeck Castle]]; he founded the town of [[Landau]], but the Landeck branch extinguished with his grandson in 1290. Frederick III, who disliked sharing Leiningen castle with his brother, had a new castle built in 1238\u201341 about 5 kilometres northeast of Leiningen, called [[Neuleiningen Castle]] (\"New Leiningen\"). Frederick III's son, Frederick IV (d. 1316), had two sons, who divided the county into Leiningen-Dagsburg and Leiningen-Hardenburg. \n\n<gallery>\nFile:Burg Altleiningen 04.JPG|[[Altleiningen Castle]]\nFile:Bad D\u00fcrkheim Hardenburg.jpg|[[Hardenburg (Bad D\u00fcrkheim)|Hardenburg]] Castle\nFile:Rocherdabo.JPG|[[County of Dagsburg|Dagsburg]] Castle\nFile:Burg Neuleiningen, Nordseite.JPG|[[Neuleiningen Castle]] \n</gallery>\n\n==History==\nHaving increased its possessions, the Leiningen family was divided around 1317 into two branches. \n\n===Leiningen-Westerburg===\n[[File:Westerburg - Schloss (KD.RLP 2 06.2015).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Westerburg]] Castle]]\n[[File:Niddatal Ilbenstadt Kloster Kath Pfarrkirche, ehem. Klosterkirche St. Maria, St. Petrus und St. Paulus.JPG|thumb|upright|Ilbenstadt Abbey]]\n\nThe elder of these, whose head was a [[landgrave]], died out in 1467. Upon this event, its lands fell to a female, the last landgrave's sister Margaret, wife of Reinhard, Lord of [[House of Westerburg|Westerburg]], and their descendants were known as the family of [[#Leiningen-Westerburg|Leiningen-Westerburg]]. Later this family was divided into two branches, those of [[#Leiningen-Altleiningen|Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen]] and [[#Leiningen-Neuleiningen|Leiningen-Westerburg-Neu-Leiningen]], both of which are extinct today.\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]], the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]] was conquered during the [[War of the First Coalition]] and annexed by [[First French Republic|France]] in 1793. The two counts of Alt- and Neu- Leiningen were arrested and jailed in Paris. They lost their territories. In 1803 they were compensated with secularized Ilbenstadt Abbey (at [[Niddatal]]) and [[Engelthal Abbey]]. The [[German mediatization]] brought an end to these short-lived counties in 1806, when their territories were divided between the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], [[House of Nassau-Weilburg|Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Nassau-Usingen]]. Ilbenstadt Abbey was sold by the House of Leiningen-Westerburg-Altleiningen in 1921, Engelthal Abbey by the heirs of the House of Leiningen-Westerburg-Neuleiningen in 1952.\n\n===Leiningen-Hardenburg===\nMeanwhile, the younger branch of the Leiningens, known as the family of [[#Leiningen-Hardenburg|Leiningen-Hardenburg]], was flourishing. On 27 June 1560, this branch was divided into the lines of [[Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg]], founded by Count [[Johann Philip]] (d. 1562), and [[Leiningen-Dagsburg-Heidesheim]] or Falkenburg, founded by Count [[Emicho (16th century)|Emicho]] (d. 1593).\n\nIn 1658 Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg divided into \n* Leiningen-Dagsburg (extinct 1706)\n* Leiningen-Heidesheim (extinct 1766)\n* Leiningen-Guntersblum (extinct 1774)\n\nThe county of Leiningen-Dagsburg was inherited by Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg in 1774. \n\nLeiningen-Guntersblum was divided between two further side branches: \n* Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg-Guntersblum, which was deprived of its lands on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] by France, but in 1803 received [[Billigheim]] as a compensation, then called Leiningen-Billigheim. In 1845 they also acquired  Neuburg Castle at [[Obrigheim]]. The branch became extinct in 1925.\n* Leiningen-Heidesheim, which in 1803 received [[Neudenau]] and became known as Leiningen-Neudenau (extinct in 1910). \n\n[[File:Amorbach-abteikirche.jpg|thumb|[[Amorbach Abbey]]]]\nIn 1779, the head of the Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg line was raised to the rank of a [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] with the title of [[Prince of Leiningen]]. In 1801, this line was deprived of its lands on the [[left bank of the Rhine]] by France, but in 1803 it received [[Amorbach Abbey]] as an ample compensation for these losses. A few years later, the [[Principality of Leiningen]] at Amorbach was [[mediatized]], and its territory is now included mainly in [[Baden Germany|Baden]], but partly in [[Bavaria]] and in [[Hesse]]. Amorbach Abbey is still today the family seat of the Prince of Leiningen.\n\nThe second prince of the Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg line, Prince [[Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen|Emich Charles]], married [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. After his death in 1814, the princess married [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], a younger son of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], by whom she became the mother of the reigning British [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\nSince 1991, the head of the princely line has been Prince [[Andreas, Prince of Leiningen|Andreas]] (b. 1955).<ref>''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels'' (2004), Volume 133, p. 249, 251.</ref> \nHis eldest brother, Prince [[Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen|Karl Emich]] was excluded from succession after he [[Morganatic marriage|married morganatically]].\n\n== Line of Descent ==\nNote that different sources use different sequence numbers for some of the Counts.

Leiningen family]]\n[[File:Leiningen Wappen.png|thumb|Evolution of the Leiningen arms]]\n'''Leiningen''' is the name of an old [[German nobility|German noble family]] whose lands lay principally in [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]. Various branches of this family developed over the centuries and ruled counties with [[Imperial immediacy]].\n\nMost of these counties were annexed by the [[First French Republic]] in 1793, after French troops conquered the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]] during the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Several family branches subsequently received secularized [[abbey]]s as compensation, but shortly afterwards, these new counties were [[German mediatization|mediatized]] and the family lost its immediacy. Today, the only existing branch is that of the [[Prince of Leiningen|Princes of Leiningen]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Codex Manesse Friedrich von Leiningen.jpg|thumb|Count Frederick II (d. 1237)]]\nThe first [[count]] of Leiningen about whom anything definite is known was a certain [[#Earliest Counts|Emich II]] (d. before 1138). He (and perhaps his father Emich I) built [[Altleiningen Castle|Leiningen Castle]], which is now known as \"Old Leiningen Castle\" (German: ''Burg Altleiningen''), around 1100 to 1110. Nearby H\u00f6ningen Abbey was then built around 1120 as the family's burial place.\n\nThis family became extinct in the male line when Count Frederick I died about 1220. Frederick I's sister, Liutgarde, married [[Simon II, Count of Saarbr\u00fccken]]. One of Liutgarde's sons, also named Frederick, inherited the lands of the counts of Leiningen, and he took their arms and their name as Frederick II (d. 1237). He became known as a ''[[Minnesinger]]'', and one of his songs was included in the [[Codex Manesse]]. Before 1212, he built himself a new castle called [[Hardenburg (Bad D\u00fcrkheim)|Hardenburg]], about 10 kilometers south of Altleiningen. This was outside the county of Leiningen on the territory of [[Limburg Abbey]], of which his uncle was the overlord (''[[Vogt]]''), which caused some trouble. \n\nHis eldest son, Simon (c. 1204\u20131234), married Gertrude, heiress of the [[County of Dagsburg]], bringing that property into the family. They had no children and Simon's two brothers inherited the county of Leiningen together: Frederick III (d. 1287) also inherited Dagsburg and Emich IV (d. c. 1276) [[Landeck Castle (Palatinate)|Landeck Castle]]; he founded the town of [[Landau]], but the Landeck branch extinguished with his grandson in 1290. Frederick III, who disliked sharing Leiningen castle with his brother, had a new castle built in 1238\u201341 about 5 kilometres northeast of Leiningen, called [[Neuleiningen Castle]] (\"New Leiningen\"). Frederick III's son, Frederick IV (d. 1316), had two sons, who divided the county into Leiningen-Dagsburg and Leiningen-Hardenburg. \n\n<gallery>\nFile:Burg Altleiningen 04.JPG|[[Altleiningen Castle]]\nFile:Bad D\u00fcrkheim Hardenburg.jpg|[[Hardenburg (Bad D\u00fcrkheim)|Hardenburg]] Castle\nFile:Rocherdabo.JPG|[[County of Dagsburg|Dagsburg]] Castle\nFile:Burg Neuleiningen, Nordseite.JPG|[[Neuleiningen Castle]] \n</gallery>\n\n==History==\nHaving increased its possessions, the Leiningen family was divided around 1317 into two branches. \n\n===Leiningen-Westerburg===\n[[File:Westerburg - Schloss (KD.RLP 2 06.2015).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Westerburg]] Castle]]\n[[File:Niddatal Ilbenstadt Kloster Kath Pfarrkirche, ehem. Klosterkirche St. Maria, St. Petrus und St. Paulus.JPG|thumb|upright|Ilbenstadt Abbey]]\n\nThe elder of these, whose head was a [[landgrave]], died out in 1467. Upon this event, its lands fell to a female, the last landgrave's sister Margaret, wife of Reinhard, Lord of [[House of Westerburg|Westerburg]], and their descendants were known as the family of [[#Leiningen-Westerburg|Leiningen-Westerburg]]. Later this family was divided into two branches, those of [[#Leiningen-Altleiningen|Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen]] and [[#Leiningen-Neuleiningen|Leiningen-Westerburg-Neu-Leiningen]], both of which are extinct today.\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]], the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]] was conquered during the [[War of the First Coalition]] and annexed by [[First French Republic|France]] in 1793. The two counts of Alt- and Neu- Leiningen were arrested and jailed in Paris. They lost their territories. In 1803 they were compensated with secularized Ilbenstadt Abbey (at [[Niddatal]]) and [[Engelthal Abbey]]. The [[German mediatization]] brought an end to these short-lived counties in 1806, when their territories were divided between the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], [[House of Nassau-Weilburg|Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Nassau-Usingen]]. Ilbenstadt Abbey was sold by the House of Leiningen-Westerburg-Altleiningen in 1921, Engelthal Abbey by the heirs of the House of Leiningen-Westerburg-Neuleiningen in 1952.\n\n===Leiningen-Hardenburg===\nMeanwhile, the younger branch of the Leiningens, known as the family of [[#Leiningen-Hardenburg|Leiningen-Hardenburg]], was flourishing. On 27 June 1560, this branch was divided into the lines of [[Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg]], founded by Count [[Johann Philip]] (d. 1562), and [[Leiningen-Dagsburg-Heidesheim]] or Falkenburg, founded by Count [[Emicho (16th century)|Emicho]] (d. 1593).\n\nIn 1658 Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg divided into \n* Leiningen-Dagsburg (extinct 1706)\n* Leiningen-Heidesheim (extinct 1766)\n* Leiningen-Guntersblum (extinct 1774)\n\nThe county of Leiningen-Dagsburg was inherited by Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg in 1774. \n\nLeiningen-Guntersblum was divided between two further side branches: \n* Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg-Guntersblum, which was deprived of its lands on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] by France, but in 1803 received [[Billigheim]] as a compensation, then called Leiningen-Billigheim. In 1845 they also acquired  Neuburg Castle at [[Obrigheim]]. The branch became extinct in 1925.\n* Leiningen-Heidesheim, which in 1803 received [[Neudenau]] and became known as Leiningen-Neudenau (extinct in 1910). \n\n[[File:Amorbach-abteikirche.jpg|thumb|[[Amorbach Abbey]]]]\nIn 1779, the head of the Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg line was raised to the rank of a [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] with the title of [[Prince of Leiningen]]. In 1801, this line was deprived of its lands on the [[left bank of the Rhine]] by France, but in 1803 it received [[Amorbach Abbey]] as an ample compensation for these losses. A few years later, the [[Principality of Leiningen]] at Amorbach was [[mediatized]], and its territory is now included mainly in [[Baden Germany|Baden]], but partly in [[Bavaria]] and in [[Hesse]]. Amorbach Abbey is still today the family seat of the Prince of Leiningen.\n\nThe second prince of the Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg line, Prince [[Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen|Emich Charles]], married [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. After his death in 1814, the princess married [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], a younger son of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], by whom she became the mother of the reigning British [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\nSince 1991, the head of the princely line has been Prince [[Andreas, Prince of Leiningen|Andreas]] (b. 1955).<ref>''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels'' (2004), Volume 133, p. 249, 251.</ref> \nHis eldest brother, Prince [[Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen|Karl Emich]] was excluded from succession after he [[Morganatic marriage|married morganatically]].\n\n== Line of Descent ==\nNote that different sources use different sequence numbers for some of the Counts.
