In this model, after activation of [[Synaptotagmin 1|synaptotagmin]] by calcium, several SNARE complexes come together to form a ring structure, with [[synaptobrevin]] forming the pore in the vesicle membrane and [[Syntaxin]] forming the pore in the cell membrane.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title = A Structural Role for the Synaptobrevin 2 Transmembrane Domain in Dense-Core Vesicle Fusion Pores|journal = The Journal of Neuroscience|date = 2015-04-08|issn = 0270-6474|pmc = 4388931|pmid = 25855187|pages = 5772\u20135780|volume = 35|issue = 14|doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3983-14.2015|first = Che-Wei|last = Chang|first2 = Enfu|last2 = Hui|first3 = Jihong|last3 = Bai|first4 = Dieter|last4 = Bruns|first5 = Edwin R.|last5 = Chapman|first6 = Meyer B.|last6 = Jackson}}</ref>  As the initial pore expands it incorporates lipids from both bilayers, eventually resulting in complete fusion of the two membranes.

The controversy lies in whether or not [[endocytosis]] always occurs in vesicle reforming after release of the neurotransmitter.  Another proposed mechanism for release of vesicle contents into extracellular fluid is called [[kiss-and-run fusion]].\n\nThere is some indication that vesicles may only form a small pore in the presynaptic membrane allowing contents to be released by standard diffusion for a short while before retreating back into the presynaptic cell.  This mechanism may be a way around [[clathrin-mediated endocytosis]].  It is also proposed that the vesicle does not need to return to an [[endosome]] to refill, though it is not thoroughly understood by which mechanism it would refill. This does not exclude full vesicle fusion, but only states that both mechanisms may operate in synaptic clefts.\n\n\"Kiss and run\" has been shown to occur in endocrine cells, though it has not been directly witnessed in synaptic gaps.<ref>Piginio et al. pp. 161-162</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[SNARE (protein)|SNARE]]\n*[[Active zone|Presynaptic active zone]]\n*[[Liposome#Applications|Liposomes]] used as models for artificial cells in [[membrane fusion]] studies.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Biochemistry]]\n", "text_old": "'''Vesicle fusion''' is the merging of a vesicle with other [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] or a part of a [[cell membrane]].

Lipid-lined pores effectiveness would also be highly dependent on the composition of both membranes, and its success or failure could vary wildly with changes in elasticity and rigidity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Protein-lined fusion pore theory ====\nAnother possible model for fusion pore formation is the protein-lined pore theory.  In this model, after activation of [[Synaptotagmin 1|synaptotagmin]] by calcium, several SNARE complexes come together to form a ring structure, with [[synaptobrevin]] forming the pore in the vesicle membrane and [[Syntaxin]] forming the pore in the cell membrane.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title = A Structural Role for the Synaptobrevin 2 Transmembrane Domain in Dense-Core Vesicle Fusion Pores|journal = The Journal of Neuroscience|date = 2015-04-08|issn = 0270-6474|pmc = 4388931|pmid = 25855187|pages = 5772\u20135780|volume = 35|issue = 14|doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3983-14.2015|first = Che-Wei|last = Chang|first2 = Enfu|last2 = Hui|first3 = Jihong|last3 = Bai|first4 = Dieter|last4 = Bruns|first5 = Edwin R.|last5 = Chapman|first6 = Meyer B.|last6 = Jackson}}</ref>  As the initial pore expands it incorporates lipids from both bilayers, eventually resulting in complete fusion of the two membranes.  The SNARE complex has a much more active role in the protein-lined pore theory; because the pore consists initially entirely of SNARE proteins, the pore is easily able to undergo intercellular regulation, making fluctuation and \"kiss-and-run\" mechanisms easily attainable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA protein-lined pore perfectly meets all the observed requirements of the early fusion pore, and while some data does support this theory,<ref name=\":2\" /> sufficient data does not exist to pronounce it the primary method of fusion. A protein-lined pore requires at least five copies of the SNARE complex while fusion has been observed with as few as two.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn both theories the function of the SNARE complex remains largely unchanged, and the entire SNARE complex is necessary to initiate fusion.  It has, however, been proven that ''in vitro'' [[Syntaxin]] ''per se'' is sufficient to drive spontaneous calcium independent fusion of synaptic vesicles containing v-SNAREs.<ref name=\"wood20002\">{{cite journal|author = Woodbury DJ, Rognlien K|title = The t-SNARE syntaxin is sufficient for spontaneous fusion of synaptic vesivles to planar membranes|journal = Cell Biology International|volume = 24|issue = 11|pages = 809\u2013818|year = 2000|doi = 10.1006/cbir.2000.0631|pmid = 11067766|url = http://pdbio.byu.edu/Faculty/djw82/Woodbury%20Rognlien%202000%20CBI%20color.pdf|access-date = 2009-05-31|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155544/http://pdbio.byu.edu/Faculty/djw82/Woodbury%20Rognlien%202000%20CBI%20color.pdf|archive-date = 2011-07-19|url-status = dead}}</ref> This suggests that in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neuronal exocytosis [[synaptotagmin]] is a dual regulator, in absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to inhibit SNARE dynamics, while in presence of Ca<sup href=\"action potential\">2+</sup> ions to act as [[agonist]] in the membrane fusion process.\n\n===Kiss-and-run hypothesis===\n\nIn [[synaptic vesicle]]s, some neurochemists have suggested that vesicles occasionally may not completely fuse with presynaptic membranes in neurotransmitter release into the [[synaptic cleft]].  The controversy lies in whether or not [[endocytosis]] always occurs in vesicle reforming after release of the neurotransmitter.  Another proposed mechanism for release of vesicle contents into extracellular fluid is called [[kiss-and-run fusion]].\n\nThere is some indication that vesicles may only form a small pore in the presynaptic membrane allowing contents to be released by standard diffusion for a short while before retreating back into the presynaptic cell.  This mechanism may be a way around [[clathrin-mediated endocytosis]].  It is also proposed that the vesicle does not need to return to an [[endosome]] to refill, though it is not thoroughly understood by which mechanism it would refill. This does not exclude full vesicle fusion, but only states that both mechanisms may operate in synaptic clefts.\n\n\"Kiss and run\" has been shown to occur in endocrine cells, though it has not been directly witnessed in synaptic gaps.<ref>Piginio et al. pp. 161-162</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[SNARE (protein)|SNARE]]\n*[[Active zone|Presynaptic active zone]]\n*[[Liposome#Applications|Liposomes]] used as models for artificial cells in [[membrane fusion]] studies.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Biochemistry]]\n", "name_user": "Hqb", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSNARE protein and pore formation:doi still broken, but substitute working url", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_fusion"}
