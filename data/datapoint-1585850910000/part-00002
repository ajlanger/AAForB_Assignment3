A session starts when a user successfully enters a valid combination of [[username]] and [[password]].\n\nWhen the display manager runs on the user's computer, it starts the X server before presenting the user the login screen, optionally repeating when the user logs out. In this condition, the DM realizes in the X Window System the functionality of <tt>[[getty (Unix)|getty]]</tt> and <tt>login</tt> on [[computer terminal|character-mode terminals]]. When the display manager runs on a remote computer, it acts like a [[telnet]] server, requesting username and password and starting a remote session.\n\nX11 Release 3 introduced display managers in October 1988 with the aim of supporting the standalone [[X terminal]]s, just coming onto the market. Various display managers continue in routine use to provide a graphical login prompt on standalone [[computer workstation]]s running X. X11R4 introduced the '''X Display Manager Control Protocol''' ('''XDMCP''') in December 1989 to fix problems in the X11R3 implementation.\n\n== History==\n[[XDM (display manager)|XDM]] (the X Window Display Manager) originated in X11R3. This first version, written by [[Keith Packard]] of the MIT X Consortium, had several limitations, the most notable of which was that it could not detect when users switched X terminals off and on. In X11R3, XDM only knew about an X terminal from its entry in the <tt>Xservers</tt> file, but XDM only consulted this file when it started. Thus every time a user switched a terminal off and on, the [[system administrator]] had to send a [[SIGHUP]] [[signal (computing)|signal]] to XDM to instruct it to rescan <tt>Xservers</tt>.\n\nXDMCP arrived with the introduction of X11R4 (December 1989). With XDMCP, the X server must actively request a display manager connection from the host. An X server using XDMCP therefore no longer requires an entry in <tt>Xservers</tt>.\n\n==Local and remote display management==\nA display manager can run on the same computer where the user sits\u2014starting one or more X servers, displaying the login screen at the beginning and (optionally) every time the user logs out\u2014or on a remote one, working according to the XDMCP protocol.\n\n[[Image:Xserver and display manager.svg|thumb|400px|In the X Window System, the '''X server''' runs on the computer in front of the user. The X server may connect to a '''display manager''' running on another computer, starting a session which may comprise a variety of programs running on that other computer.]]\n\nThe XDMCP protocol mandates that the X server starts autonomously and connects to the display manager. In the X Window System paradigm, the server runs on the computer providing the display and input devices. A server can connect, using the XDMCP protocol, to a display manager running on another computer, requesting it to start the session. In this case, the X server acts as a graphical [[telnet]] client while the display manager acts like a telnet server: users start programs from the computer running the display manager, while their input and output take place on the computer where the server (and the user) sits.\n\nAn administrator can typically configure an '''XDMCP Chooser''' program running on the local computer or X terminal to connect to a specific host's X display manager or to display a list of suitable hosts that the user can choose from. Most implementations enable such a list to contain:\n# a predefined set of hosts and their respective network addresses, and/or\n# a set of hosts (on the local [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[subnetwork|subnet]]) that the XDMCP Chooser determines by a [[broadcast domain|network broadcast]] to the available display managers.\n\nWhen the user selects a host from the list, the XDMCP Chooser running on the local machine will send a message to the selected remote computer's display manager and instruct it to connect the X server on the local computer or terminal.\n\n==X Display Manager Control Protocol==\n{{anchor|XDMCP}}\nThe X Display Manager Control Protocol uses [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 177. An X server requests that a display manager start a session by sending a <code>Query</code> packet. If the display manager allows access for that X server, it responds by sending a <code>Willing</code> packet back to the X server. (The X server can also send <code>BroadcastQuery</code> or <code>IndirectQuery</code> packets to start a session - this mechanism for requesting a session resembles using [[DHCP]] to request an IP address.)\n\nThe display manager must authenticate itself to the server. To do this the X server sends a <code>Request</code> packet to the display manager, which returns an <code>Accept</code> packet. If the <code>Accept</code> packet contains the response the X server expects, the display manager is authenticated. Producing the correct response might require the display manager to have access to a [[secret key]], for example. If authentication succeeds, the X server sends a <code>Manage</code> packet to inform the display manager. Then the display manager displays its login screen by connecting to the X server as a regular X client.\n\nDuring the session, the server can send <code>KeepAlive</code> packets to the display manager at intervals. If the display manager fails to respond with an <code>Alive</code> packet within a certain time, the X server presumes that the display manager has ceased running, and can terminate the connection.\n<!-- missing: 1. when is the connection terminated 2. more on indirect and broadcast -->\n\nOne problem with XDMCP is that, similarly to [[telnet]], the authentication takes place unencrypted. If snooping is possible, this leaves the system vulnerable to attack. It is more secure to use an [[Secure Shell|ssh]] [[tunneling protocol|tunnel]] for X traffic.<ref>http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/docs/2.14/security.html</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\nThe [[X Window System]] supplies [[X Display Manager (implementation)|XDM]] as its standard display manager.\n\nProgrammers have developed other X display managers, both commercial and free, offering additional functionality over the basic display management:\n\n===Active===\n* [[SDDM]], the successor of the KDM, written in [[C++11]], theming via [[QML]]\n* [[GNOME Display Manager|GDM]] (part of [[GNOME]])\n* [[LightDM]], a lightweight, modular, cross-desktop, fully themeable desktop display manager by [[Canonical Ltd.]]\n\n===Inactive===\n* [[KDE Display Manager|KDM]] (part of [[KDE]]) allows the user to graphically select a [[X window manager|window manager]] or [[desktop environment]] in the login screen\n* [http://qingy.sourceforge.net/ Qingy] ultralight and very configurable graphical login independent on X Window (uses [[DirectFB]]) \n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdm-options/ XDM-OPTIONS] for XDM.
