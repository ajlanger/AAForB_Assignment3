It is concerned with the provision by the state of benefits and services. Together with fiscal welfare and [[occupational welfare]], it makes up the [[social policy]] of New Zealand. [[Social welfare]] is mostly funded through general taxation. Since the 1980s welfare has been provided on the basis of need; the exception is universal superannuation.\n\n== State housing ==\n{{main|State housing}}\nThe government provides State housing to those in need. The number of houses owned by the State has varied over the years and between different governments. Currently the level of rent paid in state housing is related to the level of income of the people living in the house (income-related rents) so that those on low incomes pay below market rents. Where a household's income is relatively high the rents are set at the market rate.\n\nIn addition to the provision of State housing the government also provides an Accommodation Supplement. This is payable as a contribution to rent, board or mortgage payments for qualifying people. The Accommodation Supplement is not paid to those paying income-related rents in a State house.\n\nIn some instances a person may also qualify for a rates rebate to help with the cost of local government rates.\n\n==Social security==\nSocial security benefits are administered by [[Work and Income]]. As of July 2013, they include:\n\n*'''Child Disability Allowance''' \u2013 for people providing full-time care for a child or young person (under 18) with a disability\n*'''Jobseeker Support''' \u2013 for unemployed people aged 18 and over looking for employment. Formerly ''Unemployment Benefit''.\n*'''New Zealand Superannuation''' \u2013 for people aged 65 and above.\n*'''Orphan's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents because they are deceased, incapacitated or can't be located.\n*'''[[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Sole Parent Support]]''' \u2013 for [[single parent]]s aged 19 and over, who are caring for children aged under 14. Formerly ''Domestic Purposes Benefit - Sole Parent''.\n*'''Supported Living Payment''' \u2013 for people who cannot work due to disability, and people providing full-time care for someone 18 and over with a disability. \n*'''Unsupported Child's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents due to a family breakdown.\n*'''Veteran's Pension''' \u2013 for people who have served in the New Zealand Defence Force during a war or emergency and have a war-related disability.\n*'''Young Parent Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201318 and caring for children aged under 14, who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n*'''Youth Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201317 who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n\n=== Unemployment Benefit (Jobseeker Support)===\n====Unemployment Act 1930====\nIn 1930, while Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] was in London for the [[1930 Imperial Conference]], the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United]] Government passed the Unemployment Act, promising relief payments to those who registered as unemployed. Upon his return to New Zealand in January 1931, Forbes announced there would be no payments made without work, meaning those registered would have to participate in government 'make work' schemes such as building roads and working on farms or in forestry projects. When the register was opened in February, 23,000 people put their names down; by June the number of registered unemployed had risen to 51,000 as the [[Great Depression]] worsened. The register did not include women, [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], or boys under 16. In 1933 (by which time the number of unemployed had reached 80,000), MP [[Gordon Coates]] introduced the Small Farms (Relief of Unemployment) Bill to help turn unemployed workers into small farmers.<ref name=king />\n\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nAfter winning the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] the newly elected Labour government immediately issued a Christmas bonus to the unemployed.<ref name=king /> However, a regular [[unemployment benefit]] was not introduced until the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938; that benefit was \"payable to a person 16 years of age and over who has been in New Zealand for at least 12 months and is unemployed, is capable of and willing to undertake suitable work, and has taken reasonable steps to secure employment\".<ref name=socialsecurityact>{{cite web | title = Social Security \u2013 Scope of Legislation of 1938 | encyclopedia = Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/S/SocialSecurity/ScopeOfLegislationOf1938/en}}</ref>\n\n====Today====\nThe criteria for receiving an unemployment benefit remain similar to the original 1938 legislation. At 1 December 2011, a person could get Unemployment Benefit if they were:\n* not in full-time work\n* available for, and looking for full-time work\n* over 18 years of age (or 16\u201317 if they are married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship and have one or more children they support)\n* be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident\n* have lived in New Zealand for at least 2 years at any one time since becoming a New Zealand citizen or resident (unless you are a refugee)\n* normally living in New Zealand and intending to stay there.\nThey might still qualify if they were a full-time trainee on an approved work related course (usually less than 12 weeks) and looking for work.\n\nThe Unemployment Benefit gross rate at 1 April 2011 ranged between $150.01 and $375.04 a week depending on the applicant's age and living situation.<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment Benefit rate | work = Work and Income New Zealand | url = http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/unemployment_benefit_tables.htm| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130223035200/http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/unemployment_benefit_tables.htm| url-status = dead| archive-date = 23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom September 2007 there has been a number of changes to the delivery of unemployment benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15- to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training, or education. People applying for the unemployment benefit will be required to undertake work or training-related activities in the period between their first contact with Work and Income and their benefit commencing. They will also be required to look for and accept any offer of suitable work during that time.<ref name=\"Social Security Amendment Bill\">{{cite web | title = Social Security Amendment Bill | work = Hansard | url = http://www.hansard.parliament.govt.nz/hansard/Final/FINAL_2006_12_13.htm#_Toc154390349 | date = 13 December 2006}}</ref>\nSimilar new measures will also apply to people on [[disability pension|Sickness Benefit and Invalid's Benefit]], and the Domestic Purposes Benefit. Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply. These new measures have been criticised by the DPA (formerly Disabled Persons Assembly) a spokesperson told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' \"Disabled people have been telling Social Welfare for years that we want to work, but we want the appropriate kind of work\".<ref name=\"nzherald.co.nz\">{{cite web | title = Stings in the tail of beneficiaries bill | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10426405 | date = 1 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the Unemployment Benefit was renamed \"Jobseeker Support\", and also incorporated those on the Sickness Benefit and Domestic Purposes Benefit - Women Alone, and those on the Domestic Purposes Benefit - Sole Parent and Widow's Benefit where their youngest child is aged 14 and over.\n\n=== Domestic Purposes Benefit (Sole Parent Support) ===\n{{main|Domestic Purposes Benefit}}\n\nThe Domestic Purposes Benefit (DPB) was introduced in 1974 following the Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Social Security. It provides State financial support primarily for single parents, irrespective of whether the other parent is contributing to maintenance payments (a feature of earlier legislation) and irrespective of fault. While there is a Widow's Benefit for women with children whose partner has died, this is not available to men.\n\nUntil July 2013, there are three forms of Domestic Purposes Benefit:\n* DPB \u2013 Sole Parent\n* DPB \u2013 Care for the Sick or Infirm\n* DPB \u2013 Woman Alone\n\nThe rate of payment of a DPB is greater than the rate paid for the Unemployment Benefit and the Sickness Benefit. The rate of payment for the DPB: Care for the Sick or Infirm is the same as for the Invalid's Benefit.\n\nPeople receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent are encouraged to name the other partner and to seek [[child support]] payments. There is a financial penalty for Sole Parents (section 70A of the [[Social Security Act 1964]]) who do not seek child support without sufficient reason. Any child support payments are generally used to offset the State cost of the DPB payment, with any excess going to the sole parent.\n\nAt the end of December 2012, 109,118 people were receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent, of which around 12% were male.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html |title= Benefit Fact sheets |publisher= Ministry of Social Development New Zealand |accessdate= 12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the DPB Women Alone and DPB Care for the Sick or Infirm were removed, with those on them moving to the unemployment benefit (Jobseeker Support) and the new Supported Living Payment respectively. The DPB Sole Parent was renamed \"Sole Parent Support\" at the same time.\n\n===Health benefits (Sickness Benefit and Invalid's Benefit)===\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nTwo types of health benefits were introduced with the 1938 legislation, the Invalid's Benefit and the Sickness Benefit.\n\nThe Invalid's Benefit is paid to those permanently incapacitated or totally blind (excluding those already receiving an age benefit). An applicant must have been at least 16 years of age and residentially qualified. The applicant was residentially qualified when their incapacity arose in New Zealand or they were resident in New Zealand on 4 September 1936 and had lived in New Zealand for at least 10 years immediately before applying for the benefit. In 2007 the residence requirement was set at two years.\n\nThe Sickness Benefit is payable to those who are temporarily incapacitated from working through sickness or accident, excluding the first seven days of incapacity. To qualify, an applicant must have suffered a loss of salary, wages, or other earnings, and have resided in New Zealand for at least 12 months. The rate of benefit at the time it was introduced could not exceed the loss of earnings through incapacity. The rate now is currently the same as the Unemployment Benefit. As with other benefits introduced in 1938, the applicant had to be over 16 years of age.<ref name=socialsecurityact />\n\n====Controversies====\nIn recent years the government has been accused of exaggerating drops in unemployment by transferring people to Sickness Benefits,<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment on the drop, labour shortage a downside | work = Gisborne Herald | url = http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/article.asp?aid=7434&iid=583&sud=27 | date = 29 November 2006}}</ref> welfare commentator Lindsay Mitchell wrote in an October 2006 press release \"There is a constant flow between benefits. Taking this into account the net gain from the unemployment benefit to the sickness benefit over the five years to April 2005 was 20,870. Over the same period the net gain from the Sickness Benefit to Invalid's Benefit was 26,302, bearing in mind the same beneficiary may have been transferred more than once.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Growth in Sickness And Invalid Benefits | work = Scoop.co.nz | url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0610/S00369.htm | date = 29 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nRuth Dyson, Minister for Social Development and Employment, reported, \"...the main reason for people leaving the unemployment benefit is to enter paid work. In the last 8 years, 8.8 percent of all unemployment benefit cancellations were the result of a transfer to the sickness benefit, and less than one-third of 1 percent of all unemployment benefit cancellations were the result of a transfer to the invalids benefit. Those figures should finally put to rest the accusation that the Opposition spokesperson on social welfare consistently makes that these outstanding figures for the reduction in those on the unemployment benefit are as a result of a transfer to another benefit.

It was progressively implemented between October 2004 and April 2007.\n\nThe package, which commenced operating on 1 April 2005, has three primary aims: to make work pay; to ensure income adequacy; and to support people into work. It replaced the system known as Family Support as well as the child components of the main social welfare benefits. The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was renamed the Minimum Family Tax Credit and the level of support was changed to encourage working families to leave the benefit system.\n\nThe Working for Families package includes several components:\n\n* Working for Families [[Tax credits]]\n* increases in Childcare Assistance\n* increases in Accommodation Supplement payments\n* changes to some benefit rules\n\nBecause parts of the package use tax credits it is also delivered by the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]].\n\nThe package is thought to cover approximately 75% of all families with dependent children.\n\n==Minimum wage==\nThe minimum wage is in two forms \u2013 the standard wage for all workers (considered adults) over the age of 18, and new entrants wage for young people aged 16 and 17.\n\nThe minimum wage rates are reviewed every year and are gross amounts before tax.. As of 1 April 2019, the adult minimum wage rate that applies to employees aged 18 or over is $17.70 per hour. The new entrants minimum rate is $14.16 per hour, and this applies to 16 and 17 year olds for the first three months of employment, after which they become eligible for the adult minimum wage rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/workers-rights/minimum-wage/|title=Minimum wage|publisher=Employment New Zealand|accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\n==History of changes==\n=== Liberal Government reforms ===\nAmong the early forms of social welfare in New Zealand was the old age pension, introduced by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] in 1898. The scheme was introduced to avoid what MP [[William Pember Reeves]] described as the \"worst social evils and miseries\" referring to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[workhouse]]s where the elderly lived in spartan institutional circumstances. The pension scheme was non-contributory and was available only to the \"deserving poor\"; men and women who had become destitute through no fault of their own. The prime responsibility for protecting individuals from the hazards of sickness and unemployment lay with individuals themselves, their families and various charity organisations.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n \nA decade later a widows' pension was introduced for women with children who had lost their husbands. The Liberals also passed the Workers Dwellings Act in 1905 allowing the government to buy land, build houses, and rent them to workers and their families. The small-scale scheme that resulted from this legislation can be seen as a precursor to the much larger state housing introduced by the first [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government in the 1930s.<ref name=king>''The Penguin History of New Zealand'' Michael King Penguin Books (NZ) 2005. pp. 269\u2013270, 346\u201347, 356\u201359,466</ref>\n\n=== First Labour Government ===\nThe [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] was won by the first Labour government. A regular [[unemployment benefit]] was introduced with the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938. Under the Act the Government introduced a raft of social welfare benefits, mostly means tested, that were more generous and covered more people than before. The welfare state they created was a male wage-earners welfare state. Alongside policies to create full employment were policies to set fair wages sufficient for a man to provide for a family.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n=== Change in approach in the 1980s ===\nBy 1984 the political culture changed, with social welfare targeted according to need, not distributed universally according to citizenship. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]] did not overtly change the main welfare system, however, real expenditure per benefit recipient fell. Some benefits were removed such as the unemployment benefit for under 18-year olds and funding for state housing was cut back.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\">''New Zealand Politics in Transition'' edited by Raymond Miller Oxford University Press (NZ) 1997. p. 256-267</ref> These changes were somewhat ad hoc in nature.\n\n=== Cutbacks of the 1990s ===\n{{main|Ruthanasia}}\nIn the early 1990s the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]] embarked on a [[free market]] programme aimed at reducing public spending and 'dependence on the state'. Welfare benefits were drastically cut in December 1990  and 'user-pays' charges were introduced for many formerly free public services. As a result these policies were widely known as \"Ruthanasia\" after [[Finance Minister (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Ruth Richardson]], although the welfare portfolio was managed by Social Welfare Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] who oversaw major cuts in her portfolio and abolished the Universal Family Benefit. An attempt in 1994 to end the Special Benefit was opposed by the Labour Party (who ostensibly abolished it in 2004) and community organisations.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 7)| work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of these changes was particularly pronounced as the unemployment rate was high due to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stockmarket crash]] and the cost-cutting programmes of the previous [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]], which had reduced the staff of many state services. The cutbacks were, however, only partially reversed by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|fifth Labour government]] but inflation meant that in real terms benefits are still lower before April 1991.\n\nBy this time the Government had moved away from a policy of full employment and universal welfare to a more targeted system. The programme of reforms had a bias in favour of families, in particular working families and were intended to make it more attractive for beneficiaries to move into the workforce.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n===Work focused support in the 21st century===\n\nAnnounced in October 2006 the Working New Zealand reform includes changes to the service delivery of [[Work and Income New Zealand|Work and Income]] and changes to the Social Security Act 1964. Amending legislation was passed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] in June 2007 including introducing a 'Purpose and Principles' section.\n\nThe government says<ref>{{cite web | title = Government press release Working New Zealand | work = [[New Zealand Ministry of Social Development|Ministry of Social Development]] | url = http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2006/pr-2006-10-26.html}}</ref> the changes will introduce an intensive employment support to every New Zealander who is receiving a benefit and is able to work.\n\nWorking New Zealand involved:\n\n*extending employment assistance to Independent Youth, [[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Domestic Purposes]], Sickness and Invalid's Benefit clients\n*setting stronger work expectations for clients in some circumstances\n*providing targeted employment initiatives to reduce the high [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] Unemployment Benefit rate\n*offering a Job Search Service for all work-ready clients\n*continuing to align rules and criteria of different benefits.\n\nFrom September 2007 there have been a number of changes to the delivery of welfare benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training or education. People applying for the Unemployment Benefit will be required to undertake work or training-related activities in the period between their first contact with Work and Income and their benefit commencing. They will also be required to look for and accept any offer of suitable work during that time.<ref name=\"Social Security Amendment Bill\"/>\nSimilar new measures will also apply to people on Sickness and Invalid Benefits, and the Domestic Purposes Benefit. Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply.\n\n'''Criticisms'''\n\nIn 2004 the Special Benefit was abolished and replaced with a new Temporary Support Assistance, this attracted criticism from the Child Poverty Action Group.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 2) | work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref> Related new measures were also criticised by the DPA (formerly Disabled Persons Assembly) a spokesperson told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' \"Disabled people have been telling Social Welfare for years that we want to work, but we want the appropriate kind of work\".<ref name=\"nzherald.co.nz\"/>\n\nSusan St John and Louise Humpage have also commented that the changes \"wipes away any notion that our social security system is about ensuring everyone can participate as citizens. Instead, it makes getting people into a job, any job, the fundamental duty of citizenship.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = A bill the poor will pay for | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/466/story.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10444701 | date = 11 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nFurther changes were expected, including further [[welfare benefit simplification]] in 2008. However, this did not eventuate before the November 2008 general election. After the election, the newly elected National Government proposed and implemented alternative reforms under the title \"Future Focus\" and established a Welfare Working Group to report on further reforms.\n\n===Historical welfare trends in New Zealand===\n\nThe benefit level for a married couple in relation to earnings in New Zealand (1961\u201378):<ref>Social Policy and the Welfare State in New Zealand by Brian Easton</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!

It is concerned with the provision by the state of benefits and services. Together with fiscal welfare and [[occupational welfare]], it makes up the [[social policy]] of New Zealand. [[Social welfare]] is mostly funded through general taxation. Since the 1980s welfare has been provided on the basis of need; the exception is universal superannuation.\n\n== State housing ==\n{{main|State housing}}\nThe government provides State housing to those in need. The number of houses owned by the State has varied over the years and between different governments. Currently the level of rent paid in state housing is related to the level of income of the people living in the house (income-related rents) so that those on low incomes pay below market rents. Where a household's income is relatively high the rents are set at the market rate.\n\nIn addition to the provision of State housing the government also provides an Accommodation Supplement. This is payable as a contribution to rent, board or mortgage payments for qualifying people. The Accommodation Supplement is not paid to those paying income-related rents in a State house.\n\nIn some instances a person may also qualify for a rates rebate to help with the cost of local government rates.\n\n==Social security==\nSocial security benefits are administered by [[Work and Income]]. As of July 2013, they include:\n\n*'''Child Disability Allowance''' \u2013 for people providing full-time care for a child or young person (under 18) with a disability\n*'''Jobseeker Support''' \u2013 for unemployed people aged 18 and over looking for employment. Formerly ''Unemployment Benefit''.\n*'''New Zealand Superannuation''' \u2013 for people aged 65 and above.\n*'''Orphan's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents because they are deceased, incapacitated or can't be located.\n*'''[[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Sole Parent Support]]''' \u2013 for [[single parent]]s aged 19 and over, who are caring for children aged under 14. Formerly ''Domestic Purposes Benefit - Sole Parent''.\n*'''Supported Living Payment''' \u2013 for people who cannot work due to disability, and people providing full-time care for someone 18 and over with a disability. \n*'''Unsupported Child's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents due to a family breakdown.\n*'''Veteran's Pension''' \u2013 for people who have served in the New Zealand Defence Force during a war or emergency and have a war-related disability.\n*'''Young Parent Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201318 and caring for children aged under 14, who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n*'''Youth Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201317 who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n\n=== Unemployment Benefit (Jobseeker Support)===\n====Unemployment Act 1930====\nIn 1930, while Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] was in London for the [[1930 Imperial Conference]], the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United]] Government passed the Unemployment Act, promising relief payments to those who registered as unemployed. Upon his return to New Zealand in January 1931, Forbes announced there would be no payments made without work, meaning those registered would have to participate in government 'make work' schemes such as building roads and working on farms or in forestry projects. When the register was opened in February, 23,000 people put their names down; by June the number of registered unemployed had risen to 51,000 as the [[Great Depression]] worsened. The register did not include women, [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], or boys under 16. In 1933 (by which time the number of unemployed had reached 80,000), MP [[Gordon Coates]] introduced the Small Farms (Relief of Unemployment) Bill to help turn unemployed workers into small farmers.<ref name=king />\n\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nAfter winning the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] the newly elected Labour government immediately issued a Christmas bonus to the unemployed.<ref name=king /> However, a regular [[unemployment benefit]] was not introduced until the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938; that benefit was \"payable to a person 16 years of age and over who has been in New Zealand for at least 12 months and is unemployed, is capable of and willing to undertake suitable work, and has taken reasonable steps to secure employment\".<ref name=socialsecurityact>{{cite web | title = Social Security \u2013 Scope of Legislation of 1938 | work = Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/S/SocialSecurity/ScopeOfLegislationOf1938/en}}</ref>\n\n====Today====\nThe criteria for receiving an unemployment benefit remain similar to the original 1938 legislation. At 1 December 2011, a person could get Unemployment Benefit if they were:\n* not in full-time work\n* available for, and looking for full-time work\n* over 18 years of age (or 16\u201317 if they are married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship and have one or more children they support)\n* be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident\n* have lived in New Zealand for at least 2 years at any one time since becoming a New Zealand citizen or resident (unless you are a refugee)\n* normally living in New Zealand and intending to stay there.\nThey might still qualify if they were a full-time trainee on an approved work related course (usually less than 12 weeks) and looking for work.\n\nThe Unemployment Benefit gross rate at 1 April 2011 ranged between $150.01 and $375.04 a week depending on the applicant's age and living situation.<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment Benefit rate | work = Work and Income New Zealand | url = http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/unemployment_benefit_tables.htm| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130223035200/http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/unemployment_benefit_tables.htm| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2013-02-23}}</ref>\n\nFrom September 2007 there has been a number of changes to the delivery of unemployment benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15- to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training, or education.

Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply.

It provides State financial support primarily for single parents, irrespective of whether the other parent is contributing to maintenance payments (a feature of earlier legislation) and irrespective of fault. While there is a Widow's Benefit for women with children whose partner has died, this is not available to men.\n\nUntil July 2013, there are three forms of Domestic Purposes Benefit:\n* DPB \u2013 Sole Parent\n* DPB \u2013 Care for the Sick or Infirm\n* DPB \u2013 Woman Alone\n\nThe rate of payment of a DPB is greater than the rate paid for the Unemployment Benefit and the Sickness Benefit. The rate of payment for the DPB: Care for the Sick or Infirm is the same as for the Invalid's Benefit.\n\nPeople receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent are encouraged to name the other partner and to seek [[child support]] payments. There is a financial penalty for Sole Parents (section 70A of the [[Social Security Act 1964]]) who do not seek child support without sufficient reason. Any child support payments are generally used to offset the State cost of the DPB payment, with any excess going to the sole parent.\n\nAt the end of December 2012, 109,118 people were receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent, of which around 12% were male.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html |title= Benefit Fact sheets: |publisher= Ministry of Social Development New Zealand |accessdate= 12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the DPB Women Alone and DPB Care for the Sick or Infirm were removed, with those on them moving to the unemployment benefit (Jobseeker Support) and the new Supported Living Payment respectively. The DPB Sole Parent was renamed \"Sole Parent Support\" at the same time.\n\n===Health benefits (Sickness Benefit and Invalid's Benefit)===\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nTwo types of health benefits were introduced with the 1938 legislation, the Invalid's Benefit and the Sickness Benefit.\n\nThe Invalid's Benefit is paid to those permanently incapacitated or totally blind (excluding those already receiving an age benefit). An applicant must have been at least 16 years of age and residentially qualified. The applicant was residentially qualified when their incapacity arose in New Zealand or they were resident in New Zealand on 4 September 1936 and had lived in New Zealand for at least 10 years immediately before applying for the benefit. In 2007 the residence requirement was set at two years.\n\nThe Sickness Benefit is payable to those who are temporarily incapacitated from working through sickness or accident, excluding the first seven days of incapacity. To qualify, an applicant must have suffered a loss of salary, wages, or other earnings, and have resided in New Zealand for at least 12 months. The rate of benefit at the time it was introduced could not exceed the loss of earnings through incapacity. The rate now is currently the same as the Unemployment Benefit. As with other benefits introduced in 1938, the applicant had to be over 16 years of age.<ref name=socialsecurityact />\n\n====Controversies====\nIn recent years the government has been accused of exaggerating drops in unemployment by transferring people to Sickness Benefits,<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment on the drop, labour shortage a downside | work = Gisborne Herald | url = http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/article.asp?aid=7434&iid=583&sud=27 | date = 29 November 2006}}</ref> welfare commentator Lindsay Mitchell wrote in an October 2006 press release \"There is a constant flow between benefits.

The savings are [[private sector|privately]] managed in a scheme of the person's choosing (if they don't choose a scheme, the government assigns them one), with the government's role limited to regulation and to the collecting and passing on of contributions via the [[Pay-as-you-earn tax|PAYE tax]] system. An added incentive for younger people is the ability to make a one-off withdrawal from their KiwiSaver fund to help to buy their first home.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/kiwisaver | title= KiwiSaver - Sorted | publisher= Commission of Financial Literacy and Retirement Income | accessdate= 5 June 2014}}</ref> While KiwiSaver remains completely voluntary, 2.15 million New Zealanders actively contributed to KiwiSaver schemes as of June 2013, equal to 56 percent of the country's population under 65.<ref name=\"KSstats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/statistics/ks-annual-statistics.html |accessdate= 31 May 2014 |title= KiwiSaver annual statistics |publisher= Inland Revenue (New Zealand)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/infoshare/ViewTable.aspx?pxID=95d18086-956f-4b1b-9261-1241053fabf8 |title = Estimated Resident Population by Age and Sex (1991+) (Annual-Jun) |publisher = Statistics New Zealand |accessdate = 5 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{As of | 2011 |December | 1}}, people may receive New Zealand Superannuation if they:\n\n* are aged 65 or over\n* are a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident\n* normally live in New Zealand at the time they applied\n \nThey must also have lived in New Zealand for at least 10 years since they turned 20 with five of those years being since they turned 50.

A family allowance was introduced in 1926, payable at two shillings a week for each child over two years old, but still subject to means testing. The Social Security Act of 1938 extended and modified existing pension arrangements, and added a social security tax to pay for them.<ref name=\"1966 History of Monetary Benefits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WelfareServices/HistoryOfMonetaryBenefits/en|title=History of Monetary Benefits}}</ref>\n\n{{rquote|right|A woman with two children received the equivalent of at least a full day's pay for a labourer as benefits, unlike wages, were not taxed.

The social security tax was raised but this was compensated for by the dropping of the national security (war) tax.

It was progressively implemented between October 2004 and April 2007.\n\nThe package, which commenced operating on 1 April 2005, has three primary aims: to make work pay; to ensure income adequacy; and to support people into work. It replaced the system known as Family Support as well as the child components of the main social welfare benefits. The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was renamed the Minimum Family Tax Credit and the level of support was changed to encourage working families to leave the benefit system.\n\nThe Working for Families package includes several components:\n\n* Working for Families [[Tax credits]]\n* increases in Childcare Assistance\n* increases in Accommodation Supplement payments\n* changes to some benefit rules\n\nBecause parts of the package use tax credits it is also delivered by the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]].\n\nThe package is thought to cover approximately 75% of all families with dependent children.\n\n==Minimum wage==\nThe minimum wage is in two forms \u2013 the standard wage for all workers (considered adults) over the age of 18, and new entrants wage for young people aged 16 and 17.\n\nThe minimum wage rates are reviewed every year and are gross amounts before tax.. As of 1 April 2019, the adult minimum wage rate that applies to employees aged 18 or over is $17.70 per hour. The new entrants minimum rate is $14.16 per hour, and this applies to 16 and 17 year olds for the first three months of employment, after which they become eligible for the adult minimum wage rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/workers-rights/minimum-wage/|title=Minimum wage|publisher=Employment New Zealand|accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\n==History of changes==\n=== Liberal Government reforms ===\nAmong the early forms of social welfare in New Zealand was the old age pension, introduced by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] in 1898. The scheme was introduced to avoid what MP [[William Pember Reeves]] described as the \"worst social evils and miseries\" referring to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[workhouse]]s where the elderly lived in spartan institutional circumstances. The pension scheme was non-contributory and was available only to the \"deserving poor\"; men and women who had become destitute through no fault of their own. The prime responsibility for protecting individuals from the hazards of sickness and unemployment lay with individuals themselves, their families and various charity organisations.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n \nA decade later a widows' pension was introduced for women with children who had lost their husbands. The Liberals also passed the Workers Dwellings Act in 1905 allowing the government to buy land, build houses, and rent them to workers and their families. The small-scale scheme that resulted from this legislation can be seen as a precursor to the much larger state housing introduced by the first [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government in the 1930s.<ref name=king>''The Penguin History of New Zealand'' Michael King Penguin Books (NZ) 2005. pp. 269\u2013270, 346\u201347, 356\u201359,466</ref>\n\n=== First Labour Government ===\nThe [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] was won by the first Labour government. A regular [[unemployment benefit]] was introduced with the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938. Under the Act the Government introduced a raft of social welfare benefits, mostly means tested, that were more generous and covered more people than before. The welfare state they created was a male wage-earners welfare state. Alongside policies to create full employment were policies to set fair wages sufficient for a man to provide for a family.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n=== Change in approach in the 1980s ===\nBy 1984 the political culture changed, with social welfare targeted according to need, not distributed universally according to citizenship. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]] did not overtly change the main welfare system, however, real expenditure per benefit recipient fell. Some benefits were removed such as the unemployment benefit for under 18-year olds and funding for state housing was cut back.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\">''New Zealand Politics in Transition'' edited by Raymond Miller Oxford University Press (NZ) 1997. p. 256-267</ref> These changes were somewhat ad hoc in nature.\n\n=== Cutbacks of the 1990s ===\n{{main|Ruthanasia}}\nIn the early 1990s the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]] embarked on a [[free market]] programme aimed at reducing public spending and 'dependence on the state'. Welfare benefits were drastically cut in December 1990  and 'user-pays' charges were introduced for many formerly free public services. As a result these policies were widely known as \"Ruthanasia\" after [[Finance Minister (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Ruth Richardson]], although the welfare portfolio was managed by Social Welfare Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] who oversaw major cuts in her portfolio and abolished the Universal Family Benefit. An attempt in 1994 to end the Special Benefit was opposed by the Labour Party (who ostensibly abolished it in 2004) and community organisations.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 7)| work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of these changes was particularly pronounced as the unemployment rate was high due to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stockmarket crash]] and the cost-cutting programmes of the previous [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]], which had reduced the staff of many state services. The cutbacks were, however, only partially reversed by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|fifth Labour government]] but inflation meant that in real terms benefits are still lower before April 1991.\n\nBy this time the Government had moved away from a policy of full employment and universal welfare to a more targeted system. The programme of reforms had a bias in favour of families, in particular working families and were intended to make it more attractive for beneficiaries to move into the workforce.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n===Work focused support in the 21st century===\n\nAnnounced in October 2006 the Working New Zealand reform includes changes to the service delivery of [[Work and Income New Zealand|Work and Income]] and changes to the Social Security Act 1964. Amending legislation was passed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] in June 2007 including introducing a 'Purpose and Principles' section.\n\nThe government says<ref>{{cite web | title = Government press release Working New Zealand | work = [[New Zealand Ministry of Social Development|Ministry of Social Development]] | url = http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2006/pr-2006-10-26.html}}</ref> the changes will introduce an intensive employment support to every New Zealander who is receiving a benefit and is able to work.\n\nWorking New Zealand involved:\n\n*extending employment assistance to Independent Youth, [[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Domestic Purposes]], Sickness and Invalid's Benefit clients\n*setting stronger work expectations for clients in some circumstances\n*providing targeted employment initiatives to reduce the high [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] Unemployment Benefit rate\n*offering a Job Search Service for all work-ready clients\n*continuing to align rules and criteria of different benefits.\n\nFrom September 2007 there have been a number of changes to the delivery of welfare benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training or education. People applying for the Unemployment Benefit will be required to undertake work or training-related activities in the period between their first contact with Work and Income and their benefit commencing. They will also be required to look for and accept any offer of suitable work during that time.<ref name=\"Social Security Amendment Bill\"/>\nSimilar new measures will also apply to people on Sickness and Invalid Benefits, and the Domestic Purposes Benefit. Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply.\n\n'''Criticisms'''\n\nIn 2004 the Special Benefit was abolished and replaced with a new Temporary Support Assistance, this attracted criticism from the Child Poverty Action Group.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 2) | work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref> Related new measures were also criticised by the DPA (formerly Disabled Persons Assembly) a spokesperson told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' \"Disabled people have been telling Social Welfare for years that we want to work, but we want the appropriate kind of work\".<ref name=\"nzherald.co.nz\"/>\n\nSusan St John and Louise Humpage have also commented that the changes \"wipes away any notion that our social security system is about ensuring everyone can participate as citizens. Instead, it makes getting people into a job, any job, the fundamental duty of citizenship.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = A bill the poor will pay for | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/466/story.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10444701 | date = 11 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nFurther changes were expected, including further [[welfare benefit simplification]] in 2008. However, this did not eventuate before the November 2008 general election. After the election, the newly elected National Government proposed and implemented alternative reforms under the title \"Future Focus\" and established a Welfare Working Group to report on further reforms.\n\n===Historical welfare trends in New Zealand===\n\nThe benefit level for a married couple in relation to earnings in New Zealand (1961\u201378):<ref>Social Policy and the Welfare State in New Zealand by Brian Easton</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!
