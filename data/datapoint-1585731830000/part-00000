During that period, [[David Letterman]] showed on TV a ''Nancy'' panel with Plastino's signature and made a joke about Plastino as a superhero name. (Letterman's writers were apparently unaware that Plastino was known for his superheroes.)\n\nThe strip has continued to the present day by different writers and artists. [[Mark Lasky]] briefly handled the daily strip in 1982/1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. The strip was handed to [[Jerry Scott]] in 1983, who gradually started to draw the strip in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations.

At the time of the announcement, 75 newspapers still ran the strip. Jaimes said, \"Nancy has been my favorite sassy grouch for a long time. I'm excited to be sassy and grouchy through her voice instead of just mine\" and \"the Nancy I know and love is a total jerk and also gluttonous and also has big feelings and voraciously consumes her world\". Comics historian [[Tom Spurgeon]] describes Jaimes as funny and talented, with an approach to the character that both breaks with and pays homage to Bushmiller's version.<ref name=Post1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/04/08/for-the-first-time-in-her-85-years-nancy-will-be-drawn-by-a-woman/?noredirect=on|title=For the first time in her 85 years, 'Nancy' will be drawn by a woman|last=Cavna|first=Michael|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 8, 2018|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Post2>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/09/20/the-private-cartoonist-behind-nancy-will-make-her-public-debut-at-the-cxc-festival/ |title=The private cartoonist behind 'Nancy' will make her public debut at the CXC festival |author=Michael Cavna |date=September 20, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"vulture\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/nancy-comic-artist-olivia-jaimes-gives-extended-interview.html |title=Olivia Jaimes, the Mysterious Cartoonist Behind ''Nancy'', Gives Rare Interview |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture.com]] |date=November 26, 2018 |access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the process, Jaimes updated the strip's technology, including Nancy frequently using her [[smartphone]] and attending [[robotics]] classes. The September 3, 2018 strip spawned an [[Internet meme]], depicting Nancy riding a [[Self-balancing scooter|hoverboard]]. using two phones, one of which was attached to a [[selfie stick]], and proclaiming that \"Sluggo is [[wikt:lit|lit]]\". Jaimes described her aim with that strip to \"most upset the person who likes me the least&nbsp;... somebody who's like, 'Nancy sucks now'&nbsp;... what I imagine my greatest hater would despise most is Nancy interacting with every piece of technology using words you don't understand.\"<ref name=\"vulture\" /><ref name=Post2 />\n\n== Art style ==\nBushmiller refined and simplified his drawing style over the years to create a uniquely stylized comic world. ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' illustrates its entry on ''comic strip'' with a ''Nancy'' cartoon. Despite the small size of the reproduction, both the art and the gag are clear, and an eye-tracking survey once determined that ''Nancy'' was so conspicuous that it was the first strip most people viewed on a newspaper comics page.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn a 1988 essay, \"[[How to Read Nancy]]\", [[Mark Newgarden]] and [[Paul Karasik]] offered a probing analysis of Bushmiller's strip:\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |To say that ''Nancy'' is a simple gag strip about a simple-minded slot-nosed kid is to miss the point completely. Nancy only appears to be simple at a casual glance. Like architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]], the simplicity is a carefully designed function of a complex amalgam of formal rules laid out by the designer. To look at Bushmiller as an architect is entirely appropriate, for Nancy is, in a sense, a blueprint for a comic strip. Walls, floors, rocks, trees, ice-cream cones, motion lines, midgets and principals are carefully positioned with no need for further embellishment. And they are laid out with one purpose in mind\u2014to get the gag across. Minimalist? Formalist? Structuralist?

''Nancy'' is Plato's playground. Ernie Bushmiller didn't draw A tree, A house, A car. Oh, no. Ernie Bushmiller drew ''the'' tree, ''the'' house, ''the'' car. Much has been made of the \"three rocks.\" Art Spiegelman explains how a drawing of three rocks in a background scene was Ernie's way of showing us there were some rocks in the background. It was always three. Why? Because two rocks wouldn't be \"some rocks.\" Two rocks would be a pair of rocks. And four rocks was unacceptable because four rocks would indicate \"some rocks\" but it would be one rock more than was necessary to convey the idea of \"some rocks.\" A ''Nancy'' panel is an irreduceable concept, an atom, and the comic strip is a molecule.<ref>McCloud, Scott.

Currently, we're using Ernie Bushmiller's art exclusively, but we're not limited to his work... Once I find a strip with a promising panel, I clean up the art as much as I can in Photoshop. I remove the extra panels, and then begin coloring the art. When the panel is colored, I run a filter on the art to create the halftone dots that make the panel look as if it was printed on an old-fashioned four-color press. Finally, I flatten the image and add the indicia, including the original publication date of the strip. Repeat the process until... well, I run out of material.

''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' illustrates its entry on ''comic strip'' with a ''Nancy'' cartoon.

To look at Bushmiller as an architect is entirely appropriate, for Nancy is, in a sense, a blueprint for a comic strip. Walls, floors, rocks, trees, ice-cream cones, motion lines, midgets and principals are carefully positioned with no need for further embellishment. And they are laid out with one purpose in mind\u2014to get the gag across. Minimalist? Formalist? Structuralist?

''Nancy'' is Plato's playground. Ernie Bushmiller didn't draw A tree, A house, A car. Oh, no. Ernie Bushmiller drew ''the'' tree, ''the'' house, ''the'' car. Much has been made of the \"three rocks.\" Art Spiegelman explains how a drawing of three rocks in a background scene was Ernie's way of showing us there were some rocks in the background. It was always three. Why? Because two rocks wouldn't be \"some rocks.\" Two rocks would be a pair of rocks. And four rocks was unacceptable because four rocks would indicate \"some rocks\" but it would be one rock more than was necessary to convey the idea of \"some rocks.\" A ''Nancy'' panel is an irreduceable concept, an atom, and the comic strip is a molecule.<ref>McCloud, Scott.

The lack of context-indeed, it's very removal-is what attracted me to Random Acts the moment Guy explained it to me... The process begins by skimming through Nancy daily strips. Currently, we're using Ernie Bushmiller's art exclusively, but we're not limited to his work... Once I find a strip with a promising panel, I clean up the art as much as I can in Photoshop. I remove the extra panels, and then begin coloring the art. When the panel is colored, I run a filter on the art to create the halftone dots that make the panel look as if it was printed on an old-fashioned four-color press. Finally, I flatten the image and add the indicia, including the original publication date of the strip. Repeat the process until... well, I run out of material. Thanks to the genius of Ernie Bushmiller, that's not going to happen any time soon.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Lotshaw |first1=John |title=Random Acts of Nancy |url=https://www.gocomics.com/blog/3005/john-lotshaw-random-acts-of-nancy |website=GoComics blog |access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Guy Gilchrist's departure from ''Nancy'', this strip was discontinued.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Dave Strickler|Strickler, Dave]].
