Derek and Rose share a kiss and are dating, much to Meredith's distress as she tries to get over him. Despite their seemingly happy relationship, Rose is soon bothered by comments made by hospital personnel about Meredith and Derek's breakup being only temporary (which end up being true when Derek and Meredith get back together for good).
