It had a maximum elevation of 60\u00b0 and could traverse up to 360\u00b0, depending on the emplacement. The ''C/39'' mount had two compartments; the upper housed the guns and their loading equipment, while the lower contained the ammunition hoists, their motors, and the elevation and traverse motors. The mount was fully powered and had an underground magazine.<ref>Hogg, p. 242</ref> Normally these were placed in open concrete [[barbette]]s, relying on their armor, but Hitler thought that there was not enough protection for the guns of [[Cross-Channel guns in the Second World War|Battery ''Todt'']] emplaced on [[Cap-Gris-Nez]] in the [[Pas de Calais]] near [[Wimereux]] and ordered a concrete casemate {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick built over and around the mounts. This had the unfortunate effect of limiting their traverse to 120\u00b0.<ref>Gander and Chamberlain, p. 256</ref> Other C/39 mounts were installed at the [[Hanstholm fortress]] in Denmark, and the [[Kristiansand Cannon Museum|Vara fortress]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway.\n\nFour ''Drh LC/34'' turrets, three of which were originally intended to re-arm the ''Gneisenau'' and one completed to the Soviet order, modified for land service, were planned to be emplaced at [[Paimpol]], [[Brittany]] and on the [[La Hague|Cap de la Hague]] on the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], but construction never actually began.<ref>Gander and Chamberlain, p. 259</ref> Construction for two of those turrets was well underway at [[Tirpitz Museum (Denmark)|Blaavand-Oksby]], Denmark when the war ended.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =38 cm/52 (14.96\") SK C/34\n  | date = 2 April 2009\n|work=NavWeaps |publisher=Tony DiGiulian\n  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_15-52_skc34.htm\n  | accessdate = 27 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417123518/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_15-52_skc34.htm| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Rolf\n  | first = Rudi\n  | title = Der Atlantikwall: Bauten der deutschen K\u00fcstenbefestigungen 1940\u20131945\n  | publisher = Biblio\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = Osnabr\u00fcck\n  | page = 315\n  | isbn = 3-7648-2469-7}}</ref>\n\n==Railroad gun==\n{{main|38 cm Siegfried K (E)}}\nSome guns also saw service as [[38 cm Siegfried K (E)]] [[railroad gun]]s, one of these being captured by American forces during the [[Operation Dragoon|Rh\u00f4ne Valley campaign]] in 1944.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois, p. 75</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of naval guns]]\n\n===Weapons of comparable role, performance and era===\n* [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun]] : French equivalent\n* [[381mm / 50 Model 1934 naval gun]] : Italian equivalent\n*[[BL 15-inch Mk I naval gun]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==References==\n===Service manuals and publications===\n* Krupp datasheet 38&nbsp;cm S.K.C/34 WA52-444\n* Krupp datasheet 38&nbsp;cm S.K.C/34 e WA52-453(e)\n* Bauvorschrift fuer den Schiffskoerper der Schlachtschiffe \"F\" und \"G\" (\"Ersatz Hannover\" und \"Ersatz Schleswig-Holstein\") O.K.M Archiv K I Nr. 20 Berlin, den 16.November 1936\n* M.Dv.Nr.185, Heft 2, Abmessungen, Gewichte, Raumbedarf der Munition und ihrer Packgef\u00e4\u00dfe\n* Unterlagen und Richtlinien zur Bestimmung der Hauptkampfentfernung und der Gescho\u00dfwahl Heft a Textband\n* Unterlagen und Richtlinien zur Bestimmung der Hauptkampfentfernung und der Gescho\u00dfwahl Heft h Eigene Durchschlagsangaben f\u00fcr Schlachtschiffe Bismarck, Tirpitz und Beispiele (G.Kdos 100)\n* AVKS-700 Schlu\u00dfbericht vom 31.05.1941, AVKS Erprobungen auf Schlachtschiff Bismarck\n\n===Literature===\n* Campbell, John.

''Tirpitz'' fired her main battery against Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm aircraft in Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood. In Operations [[Operation Paravane|Paravane]], Obviate, and [[Operation Catechism|Catechism]], ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the Royal Air Force's high-level bombers.\n\n==Coast defense gun==\n[[Image:FestungHanstholmModell.JPG|right|thumb|Model of the ''38 cm SK C/34'' emplacement at Hanstholm]]\n\nThese guns were modified with a larger chamber for coast defense duties to handle the increased amount of propellant used for the special long-range ''Siegfried'' shells.<ref>http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_15-52_skc34.htm Chamber volume increased from 19,467 in3 (319 dm3) to  22,072 in3 (361.7 dm3), rifling length reduced from 629.2 in. (15.982 m) to 620 in (15.748 m)</ref><ref>Campbell, p. 229</ref> Gander and Chamberlain quote a weight of {{convert|105.3|t|ton}} for these guns, presumably accounting for the extra volume of the enlarged chamber.<ref>Gander and Chamberlain, p. 272</ref> An armored single mount, the ''Bettungsschiessger\u00fcst'' (\"Firing platform\") ''C/39'' was used by these guns. It had a maximum elevation of 60\u00b0 and could traverse up to 360\u00b0, depending on the emplacement. The ''C/39'' mount had two compartments; the upper housed the guns and their loading equipment, while the lower contained the ammunition hoists, their motors, and the elevation and traverse motors. The mount was fully powered and had an underground magazine.<ref>Hogg, p. 242</ref> Normally these were placed in open concrete [[barbette]]s, relying on their armor, but Hitler thought that there was not enough protection for the guns of [[Cross-Channel guns in the Second World War|Battery ''Todt'']] emplaced on [[Cap-Gris-Nez]] in the [[Pas de Calais]] near [[Wimereux]] and ordered a concrete casemate {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick built over and around the mounts. This had the unfortunate effect of limiting their traverse to 120\u00b0.<ref>Gander and Chamberlain, p. 256</ref> Other C/39 mounts were installed at the [[Hanstholm fortress]] in Denmark, and the [[Kristiansand Cannon Museum|Vara fortress]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway.\n\nFour ''Drh LC/34'' turrets, three of which were originally intended to re-arm the ''Gneisenau'' and one completed to the Soviet order, modified for land service, were planned to be emplaced at [[Paimpol]], [[Brittany]] and on the [[La Hague|Cap de la Hague]] on the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], but construction never actually began.<ref>Gander and Chamberlain, p. 259</ref> Construction for two of those turrets was well underway at [[Tirpitz Museum (Denmark)|Blaavand-Oksby]], Denmark when the war ended.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =38 cm/52 (14.96\") SK C/34\n  | date = 2 April 2009\n|work=NavWeaps |publisher=Tony DiGiulian\n  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_15-52_skc34.htm\n  | accessdate = 27 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417123518/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_15-52_skc34.htm| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Rolf\n  | first = Rudi\n  | title = Der Atlantikwall: Bauten der deutschen K\u00fcstenbefestigungen 1940\u20131945\n  | publisher = Biblio\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = Osnabr\u00fcck\n  | page = 315\n  | isbn = 3-7648-2469-7}}</ref>\n\n==Railroad gun==\n{{main|38 cm Siegfried K (E)}}\nSome guns also saw service as [[38 cm Siegfried K (E)]] [[railroad gun]]s, one of these being captured by American forces during the [[Operation Dragoon|Rh\u00f4ne Valley campaign]] in 1944.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois, p. 75</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of naval guns]]\n\n===Weapons of comparable role, performance and era===\n* [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun]] : French equivalent\n* [[381mm / 50 Model 1934 naval gun]] : Italian equivalent\n*[[BL 15-inch Mk I naval gun]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==References==\n===Service manuals and publications===\n* Krupp datasheet 38&nbsp;cm S.K.C/34 WA52-444\n* Krupp datasheet 38&nbsp;cm S.K.C/34 e WA52-453(e)\n* Bauvorschrift fuer den Schiffskoerper der Schlachtschiffe \"F\" und \"G\" (\"Ersatz Hannover\" und \"Ersatz Schleswig-Holstein\") O.K.M Archiv K I Nr. 20 Berlin, den 16.November 1936\n* M.Dv.Nr.185, Heft 2, Abmessungen, Gewichte, Raumbedarf der Munition und ihrer Packgef\u00e4\u00dfe\n* Unterlagen und Richtlinien zur Bestimmung der Hauptkampfentfernung und der Gescho\u00dfwahl Heft a Textband\n* Unterlagen und Richtlinien zur Bestimmung der Hauptkampfentfernung und der Gescho\u00dfwahl Heft h Eigene Durchschlagsangaben f\u00fcr Schlachtschiffe Bismarck, Tirpitz und Beispiele (G.Kdos 100)\n* AVKS-700 Schlu\u00dfbericht vom 31.05.1941, AVKS Erprobungen auf Schlachtschiff Bismarck\n\n===Literature===\n* Campbell, John.
