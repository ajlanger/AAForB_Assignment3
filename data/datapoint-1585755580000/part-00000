Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]]s. There are different types of flowcharts: each type has its own set of boxes and notations. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:\n\n* a processing step, usually called ''activity'', and denoted as a rectangular box.\n* a decision, usually denoted as a diamond.\n \nA flowchart is described as \"cross-functional\" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit.  A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.\n\nFlowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the [[histogram]], [[Pareto chart]], [[check sheet]], [[control chart]], [[Ishikawa diagram|cause-and-effect diagram]], and the [[scatter diagram]]. Similarly, in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the [[activity diagram]], which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.\n\n[[Nassi-Shneiderman diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] are an alternative notation for process flow.\n\nCommon alternative names include: flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process [[flow diagram]], [[workflow|work flow]] diagram, business flow diagram. The terms \"flowchart\" and \"flow chart\" are used interchangeably.\n\nThe underlying [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.\n\n== History ==\nThe first structured method for documenting process flow, the \"[[flow process chart]]\", was introduced by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] in the presentation \"Process Charts: First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work\", to members of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)]] in 1921.<ref>Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1921) ''[https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/GilbrethLibrary/gilbrethproject/processcharts.pdf Process Charts]''. American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</ref> The Gilbreths' tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula. In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, [[Allan H. Mogensen]] began to train business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nArt Spinanger, a 1944 graduate of [[Allan H. Mogensen|Mogensen]]'s class, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program.  [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], another 1944 graduate, Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], applied the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart, to present multiple documents and their relationships.<ref>{{cite web |last = Graham, Jr. |first = Ben S. |title = People come first |work = Keynote Address at Workflow Canada |url = http://www.worksimp.com/articles/keynoteworkflowcanada.htm |date = 10 June 1996}}</ref> In 1947, [[ASME]] adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the \"ASME Standard: Operation and Flow Process Charts.\"<ref>American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1947) ''ASME standard; operation and flow process charts''.

Often [[pseudo-code]] is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one.\n\nNowadays flowcharts are still used for describing [[computer algorithm]]s.<ref>Bohl, Rynn: \"Tools for Structured and Object-Oriented Design\", Prentice Hall, 2007.</ref> Modern techniques such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.\n\n== Types ==\nSterneckert (2003) suggested that flowcharts can be modeled from the perspective of different user groups (such as managers, system analysts and clerks), and that there are four general types:<ref name=\"Ster03\">Alan B. Sterneckert (2003) ''Critical Incident Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8z93xStbEpAC&lpg=PP126&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 126]</ref> \n* ''Document flowcharts'', showing controls over a document-flow through a system\n* ''Data flowcharts'', showing controls over a data-flow in a system\n* ''System flowcharts'', showing controls at a physical or resource level\n* ''Program flowchart'', showing the controls in a program within a system\nNotice that every type of flowchart focuses on some kind of control, rather than on the particular flow itself.<ref name=\"Ster03\"/>\n\nHowever, there are some different classifications. For example, Andrew Veronis (1978) named three basic types of flowcharts: the ''system flowchart'', the ''general flowchart'', and the ''detailed flowchart''.<ref>Andrew Veronis (1978) ''Microprocessors: Design and Applications''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZ9QAAAAMAAJ&q=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&dq=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&as_brr=0 p. 111]</ref> That same year Marilyn Bohl (1978) stated \"in practice, two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning: ''system flowcharts'' and ''program flowcharts''...\".<ref>Marilyn Bohl (1978) ''A Guide for Programmers''. p. 65.</ref> More recently, Mark A. Fryman (2001) identified more differences: \"Decision flowcharts, logic flowcharts, systems flowcharts, product flowcharts, and process flowcharts are just a few of the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government\".<ref>Mark A. Fryman (2001) ''Quality and Process Improvement''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-_B7czAy0kC&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 169].</ref>\n\nIn addition, many diagram techniques are similar to flowcharts but carry a different name, such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s.\n\n== Building blocks ==\n=== Common symbols ===\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) set standards for flowcharts and their symbols in the 1960s.<ref name=\"ShellyVermaat2011\">{{cite book|author1=Gary B.

Often [[pseudo-code]] is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one.\n\nNowadays flowcharts are still used for describing [[computer algorithm]]s.<ref>Bohl, Rynn: \"Tools for Structured and Object-Oriented Design\", Prentice Hall, 2007.</ref> Modern techniques such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.\n\n== Types ==\nSterneckert (2003) suggested that flowcharts can be modeled from the perspective of different user groups (such as managers, system analysts and clerks), and that there are four general types:<ref name=\"Ster03\">Alan B. Sterneckert (2003) ''Critical Incident Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8z93xStbEpAC&lpg=PP126&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 126]</ref> \n* ''Document flowcharts'', showing controls over a document-flow through a system\n* ''Data flowcharts'', showing controls over a data-flow in a system\n* ''System flowcharts'', showing controls at a physical or resource level\n* ''Program flowchart'', showing the controls in a program within a system\nNotice that every type of flowchart focuses on some kind of control, rather than on the particular flow itself.<ref name=\"Ster03\"/>\n\nHowever, there are some different classifications. For example, Andrew Veronis (1978) named three basic types of flowcharts: the ''system flowchart'', the ''general flowchart'', and the ''detailed flowchart''.<ref>Andrew Veronis (1978) ''Microprocessors: Design and Applications''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZ9QAAAAMAAJ&q=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&dq=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&as_brr=0 p. 111]</ref> That same year Marilyn Bohl (1978) stated \"in practice, two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning: ''system flowcharts'' and ''program flowcharts''...\".<ref>Marilyn Bohl (1978) ''A Guide for Programmers''. p. 65.</ref> More recently, Mark A. Fryman (2001) identified more differences: \"Decision flowcharts, logic flowcharts, systems flowcharts, product flowcharts, and process flowcharts are just a few of the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government\".<ref>Mark A. Fryman (2001) ''Quality and Process Improvement''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-_B7czAy0kC&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 169].</ref>\n\nIn addition, many diagram techniques are similar to flowcharts but carry a different name, such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s.\n\n== Building blocks ==\n=== Common symbols ===\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) set standards for flowcharts and their symbols in the 1960s.<ref name=\"ShellyVermaat2011\">{{cite book|author1=Gary B.
