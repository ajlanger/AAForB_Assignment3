It was released on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin traveled to [[New York City]], since he felt something was \"missing\" from the record. \"My Prerogative\" was written by Brown as a response to the criticism he received for his departure from [[New Edition]]. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. \"My Prerogative\" is often considered a [[new jack swing]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe song was positively received by critics and was nominated for a [[30th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] in the category of Best R&B Urban Contemporary Single. It was also commercially successful, reaching number one in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] charts. \"My Prerogative\" also reached top ten positions in many countries, such as Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The music video for the song features Brown performing the song on stage with his band and dancers. The song was also performed at most of his concerts, usually as the last song of the set list. On the February 4, 1989 performance at [[Madison Square Garden]], he was joined on stage by many popular [[rapping|rap]] artists and producers of the time.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" has been covered and sampled by a number of artists from different genres, including [[Britney Spears]]. She released her cover in her first compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'' (2004). The cover was produced by [[Bloodshy & Avant]] and was noted for aptly referring to Spears's relationship with the media at the time. Although the song only appeared in component charts in the United States, Spears's cover surpassed Brown's version worldwide, peaking at the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway and reaching the top ten in another fourteen countries.<ref name=ultratop /><ref name=ultratopbrit />\n\n==Background==\nBrown had already completed recording sessions for ''Don't Be Cruel'' in [[Los Angeles, California]], but felt something was missing in the record. He said, \"I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than [[New York City|New York]] to come up with it'\". He traveled to New York, met with [[Teddy Riley]] - who presented him with the initial beat.<ref name=hour>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lyIiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fXQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3447,2939149|title=Bobby Brown takes his prerogative|date=1989-03-17|accessdate=2010-03-13| last=Italie|first=Hillel|work=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]}}</ref> \"My Prerogative\" was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin.

It was released on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin traveled to [[New York City]], since he felt something was \"missing\" from the record. \"My Prerogative\" was written by Brown as a response to the criticism he received for his departure from [[New Edition]]. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. \"My Prerogative\" is often considered a [[new jack swing]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe song was positively received by critics and was nominated for a [[30th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] in the category of Best R&B Urban Contemporary Single. It was also commercially successful, reaching number one in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] charts. \"My Prerogative\" also reached top ten positions in many countries, such as Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The music video for the song features Brown performing the song on stage with his band and dancers. The song was also performed at most of his concerts, usually as the last song of the set list. On the February 4, 1989 performance at [[Madison Square Garden]], he was joined on stage by many popular [[rapping|rap]] artists and producers of the time.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" has been covered and sampled by a number of artists from different genres, including [[Britney Spears]]. She released her cover in her first compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'' (2004). The cover was produced by [[Bloodshy & Avant]] and was noted for aptly referring to Spears's relationship with the media at the time. Although the song only appeared in component charts in the United States, Spears's cover surpassed Brown's version worldwide, peaking at the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway and reaching the top ten in another fourteen countries.<ref name=ultratop /><ref name=ultratopbrit />\n\n==Background==\nBrown had already completed recording sessions for ''Don't Be Cruel'' in [[Los Angeles, California]], but felt something was missing in the record. He said, \"I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than [[New York City|New York]] to come up with it'\".
