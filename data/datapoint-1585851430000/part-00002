{"title_page": "Quarter-inch cartridge", "text_new": "{{other uses|Cartridge (disambiguation)}}\n\n'''Quarter inch cartridge''' tape (abbreviated '''QIC''', commonly pronounced \"quick\") is a [[magnetic tape data storage]] format introduced by [[3M]] in 1972,<ref name=\"IBM\"/> with derivatives still in use as of 2016. QIC comes in a rugged enclosed package of aluminum and plastic that holds two tape reels driven by a single belt in direct contact with the tape. The tape was originally {{convert|1/4|in|mm|sigfig=3}} wide and anywhere from {{convert|300|to|1500|ft|m}} long. Data is written linearly along the length of the tape in one track<ref name=\"IBM\"/> (mostly on pre-1980 equipment), or written \"serpentine\", one track at a time, the drive reversing direction at the end of the tape, and each track's data written in the opposite direction to its neighbor. Since its introduction, it has been widely used, and many variations exist. There is a QIC trade association that publishes QIC standards which include interfaces and logical formats. To a very large extent it was the efficiency and openness of this organization which encouraged hardware and software developers to use this type of drive and media.\n[[Image:Quarter-Inch Cartridges.jpg|thumb|Quarter inch cartridges: left, 400MB (QIC-EX); right, 120MB (QIC-80).]]\n\n== Features of QIC ==\n\nThe QIC cartridge is distinguished from other types of tape cartridges by containing an endless drive belt which is moved at a uniform speed by a motorised [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]]. Since the belt is in contact with the tape, this ensures both that the tape moves at uniform speed, and that neutral tension is maintained at all times. This is in contrast to [[cassette tape]]s or [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]s, where the tape is moved past the head by a capstan and pinch wheel, but the takeup reel is driven by a [[servo motor]] or slipping clutch.\n\nThe tape in a QIC cartridge is not physically attached to the reels and is never completely unwound. This is again different from other cassettes or cartridges, which generally have some form of clip anchoring on at least one end of the tape. To ensure that the tape is never completely unwound, each end has a small beginning or end of tape hole which is detected by an optical sensor, and an \"early warning\" hole further from each end. If a defective drive&mdash;for example with fluff in a sensor&mdash;winds the tape past the BOT or EOT marker, the tape will detach from the spool and the cartridge will be unusable unless it is reattached.\n\nThe design of the QIC tape cartridge is very robust: the aluminium baseplate is {{convert|1/10|in|mm|sigfig=3}} thick, and the robust plastic cover can withstand abuse and impacts that would damage other tape formats.\n\nHowever, because the tape is belt-driven, seeking back and forth can eventually cause the tape to become unevenly tensioned. It is therefore necessary to periodically retension the cartridge. This is accomplished by winding the tape from beginning to end and back in one operation, allowing the belt to equalize itself. For newer QIC drives that use a [[SCSI]] interface, there is a SCSI \"RETENSION\" command to do this.\n\nWhen the cartridge gets old, the belt may not provide enough friction to turn the takeup spool smoothly. When this happens, the tape will need to be replaced.\n\nIn some cases a cartridge must be formatted before use. The capability to do this is in the drive rather than the host computer.\n\n== Generations ==\n\n=== 3M Data Cartridge (DC) ===\n\n[[File:QIC DC600A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|QIC DC 600A cassette.]]\n[[Image:SunOS 4.1.1 P1270750.jpg|thumb|[[SunOS]] 4.1.1 QIC-24 tape.]]\nThe first QIC tape format was the {{convert|5+7/8|in|mm}} by {{convert|3+7/8|in|mm}} ''Data Cartridge'' (DC) format with two internal belt-driven reels and a metal base.
