The recipe for this vinegar has almost as many variations as its legend.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinaigre_des_4_Voleurs.jpg|thumb|upright|A 17th-century bottle]]\nThis specific vinegar composition is said to have been used during the medieval period when the black death was happening, to prevent the catching of this dreaded disease.<ref name=\"gattefosse\">Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, Gattefosse\u2019s Aromatherapy (CW Daniel Company, Ltd.  First published in Paris, France in 1937 by Girardot & Cie.), 85-86.</ref> Other similar types of herbal vinegars have been used as medicine since the time of Hippocrates.\n\nEarly recipes for this vinegar called for a number of herbs to be added into a vinegar solution and left to steep for several days.  The following vinegar recipe hung in the Museum of Paris in 1937, and is said to have been an original copy of the recipe posted on the walls of Marseilles during an episode of the plague:\n\n{{quote|Take three pints of strong white wine vinegar, add a handful of each of wormwood, meadowsweet, wild marjoram and sage, fifty cloves, two ounces of campanula roots, two ounces of angelic, rosemary and horehound and three large measures of champhor.  Place the mixture in a container for fifteen days, strain and express then bottle.  Use by rubbing it on the hands, ears and temples from time to time when approaching a plague victim.<ref name=\"gattefosse\" />}}\n\nPlausible reasons for not contracting the plague was that the herbal concoction contained natural flea repellents, since the flea is the carrier for the plague bacillus, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.  [[Artemisia vulgaris|Wormwood]] has properties similar to cedar as an insect repellent, as do aromatics such as sage, cloves, camphor, rosemary, and campanula.  [[Filipendula ulmaria|Meadowsweet]], although known to contain [[salicylic acid]], is mainly used to mask odors like decomposing bodies.\n\nAnother recipe called for dried rosemary, dried sage flowers, dried lavender flowers<ref>{{Cite book|title=The practical guide to using herbs : knowing, growing, cooking|last=Houdret, Jessica.|date=2006|publisher=Lorenz|isbn=978-0-7548-1647-8|oclc=84543649}}</ref>, fresh rue, camphor dissolved in spirit, sliced garlic, bruised cloves, and distilled wine vinegar.<ref>Hopkins, The Scientific American Encyclopedia of Formulas, 1910, 878.</ref>\n\nModern-day versions include various herbs that typically include [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], and [[rosemary]], along with [[garlic]]. Additional herbs sometimes include [[rue]], [[Mentha|mint]], and [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]]. It has become traditional to use four herbs in the recipe\u2014one for each thief, though earlier recipes often have a dozen herbs or more. It is still sold in [[Provence]]. In Italy a mixture called \"seven thieves vinegar\" is sold as a [[smelling salt]], though its ingredients appear to be the same as in four thieves mixtures.<ref>http://www.cooker.net/doc/3A7B645D81D2CFB5C12572EE004D745A</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\nThe usual story declares that a group of thieves during a European plague outbreak were robbing the dead or the sick. When they were caught, they offered to exchange their secret recipe, which had allowed them to commit the robberies without catching the disease, in exchange for leniency. Another version says that the thieves had already been caught before the outbreak and their sentence had been to bury dead plague victims; to survive this punishment, they created the vinegar. The city in which this happened is usually said to be [[Marseille]] or [[Toulouse]], and the time period can be given as anywhere between the 14th and 18th century depending on the storyteller.<ref name=\"legend\">[https://plaguesage.com Legend of Four Thieves Vinegar]</ref>\n\nAn alternative theory says that \"four thieves vinegar\" could be a corruption of \"Dick Forthave's vinegar\", a concoction sold and invented by one Richard Forthave.
