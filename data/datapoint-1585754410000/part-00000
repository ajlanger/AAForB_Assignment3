The network is owned by [[Corus Entertainment]], which oversees all of the network's national news programming as well as local news on its 15 [[owned-and-operated station]]s.\n\nCorus also operates several [[talk radio]] stations under the \"Global News Radio\" brand. The same division also operates a news website under the same brand.\n\n==National programs==\nGlobal's lineup of national news and current affairs programming is as follows:\n\n* ''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'': Weekdays 9:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/CT/MT/PT, 10:00&nbsp;a.m. AT\n* ''[[Global National]]'': Nightly 7:30&nbsp;p.m. NT, 6:30&nbsp;p.m. AT/ET, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. CT/MT/PT, 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Kelowna and Montreal\n* ''[[The West Block]]'': Sundays 10:00&nbsp;a.m. PT/MT, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/CT, 12:00 Noon AT\n\nAlthough Global stations had always carried local news in various forms, the first tentative steps towards a national presence came in 1994 with the launch of ''[[First National (television show)|First National]]'' with [[Peter Kent]], an early-evening program focusing on national and international news but airing only in central Canada. After acquiring the [[Western International Communications]] (WIC) group of stations, Global cancelled ''First National'' in February 2001 and briefly aired the similar WIC newscast ''[[Canada Tonight]]'' in its place.\n\nIn September 2001, Global replaced ''Canada Tonight'' with a new network newscast, ''[[Global National]]'', anchored by [[Kevin Newman (Canadian journalist)|Kevin Newman]] until 2010 and [[Dawna Friesen]] since.  It aired from the network's new national news centre at [[CHAN-DT|CHAN-TV]]'s studio in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]]. The program initially aired only on weekdays. In February 2005, it launched a weekend edition anchored by [[Tara Nelson]] until 2008 and [[Robin Gill (journalist)|Robin Gill]] since.\n\nOriginally airing in different timeslots around the country, ''Global National'' moved to a standard 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (6:30&nbsp;p.m. Atlantic) start time nationwide in 2006. Since then, ''Global National'' has gained ground on longtime number-one ''[[CTV National News]]'', overtaking it on several occasions. A [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] version of the newscast, titled ''Global National Mandarin'', launched on January 23, 2012 with anchor Carol Wang, and is seen weeknights on [[Shaw Multicultural Channel]] in Vancouver and Calgary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/890821/global-news-and-shaw-multicultural-channel-launch-global-national-mandarin-newscast|title=Global News and Shaw Multicultural Channel Launch Global National Mandarin Newscast|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the network extended its [[CIII-DT|Toronto owned-and-operated station's]] morning program (''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'') by 30 minutes, with this additional half-hour airing across its other owned-and-operated stations;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1087965/global-news-takes-breakfast-to-new-heights-with-a-national-version-of-the-morning-show|title=Global News Takes Breakfast to New Heights With a National Version of the Morning Show|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}</ref> prior to this, Global did not air a national [[morning show]]. In addition, the network's owned-and-operated stations in select markets produce their own local morning shows (see [[#Local programs|below]]); stations which do not produce a local morning show either air the morning show from a larger market, or run daytime programming repeated from [[Shaw Media]]'s cable [[specialty channel]]s, such as ''Crash Test Mommy'' and ''The Mom Show''.\n\nGlobal launched its first investigative [[newsmagazine]] series on November 30, 2008.  The weekly program, titled ''[[16x9 - The Bigger Picture]]'', features a high-gloss, tabloid format, and is the network's first foray into the field long occupied by CTV's ''[[W-FIVE]]'' and CBC's ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|the fifth estate]]''. Global also formerly aired a weekly [[Documentary film|documentary]] series, ''[[Global Currents]]''.\n\nDuring the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]], Global News also produced a weekly series, ''Focus: Decision Canada'', covering news and issues in the election campaign.

The long-dominant [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]] Vancouver (BCTV) had been an exception; its news operation was renamed ''BCTV News on Global'' when it became a Global owned-and-operated in 2001, and its individual newscast titles (e.g. ''News Hour'') were also retained.\n\nAs part of a network-wide branding overhaul, local newscast titles and timeslots were standardized effective February 6, 2006,<ref>[http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html Global News Brings Enhanced National and Local News Package] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928054053/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html |date=2009-09-28 }}, Global press release, February 1, 2006.

The only station that did not follow the BCTV model is [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna, which has kept its call sign as part of its news branding. As of 2011, [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna have rebranded their news operations as ''Global News Okanagan''. In April 2016, Global once again rebranded its news programs national-wide dropping the BCTV model.\n\n* ''[[Morning News (Canadian morning TV show)|Global News Morning]]'': weekday and weekend mornings (previously known as ''Morning News'')\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at Noon]]'': weekdays and weekends at noon (previously known as ''Noon News Hour'')\n** Exceptions: ''Scene and Heard'' (non-news regional lifestyle show on [[CISA-TV|CISA]])\n* ''Global News at 5'': weekdays at 5:00 pm (previously known as ''Early News'')\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at 5:30]]'': weekdays at 5:30 pm ([[CIII-DT|Toronto]] and [[CKMI-DT|Montreal]]<nowiki/>)\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News Hour at 6]]'': nightly at 6:00 pm (previously known as ''News Hour'') \n* ''Global News at 6:30'': weeknights at 6:30 pm ([[CHBC-DT|Okanagan]]) and ([[CKMI-DT|Montreal]])\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at 10]]'' or ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at 11]]'': nightly at 10:00 pm ([[CKND-DT|Winnipeg]], [[CFRE-DT|Regina]], and [[CFSK-DT|Saskatoon]]) or 11:00 pm (previously known as ''News Hour Final'' or ''News Final'')\n* ''Focus'': Weekends (Regina/Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, BC)\n\nOn October 4, 2007, Global's then-parent company [[Canwest]] announced it would be centralizing [[Television studio#Production control room|news production control room]] functions for all owned-and-operated stations (except [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] [[Kelowna]]) at four broadcast centres - [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]] [[Vancouver]], [[CITV-DT|CITV]] [[Edmonton]], [[CICT-DT|CICT]] [[Calgary]], and [[CIII-DT|CIII]] [[Toronto]]. The company stated this would allow all of its stations to make a transition to high definition broadcasting, and create around 50 new jobs at the four stations. Approximately 250 positions were to be eliminated in the other stations, the majority of which were behind-the-scenes/technical positions.<ref>{{cite news |title=CanWest To Launch State-of-the-Art Broadcast Centres; Cuts Jobs |url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |accessdate=12 April 2019 |work=Channel Canada |date=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321225015/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nA press release from the company has also stated that on-air talent (including weather anchors), reporters, producers, photographers, editors, and other news gathering positions will remain at the affected stations. Global Edmonton took over production of Global Maritimes' newscasts in mid-August 2008, and on September 4, 2008, took over production of all newscasts at [[CHCA-TV]] (the [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] station in [[Red Deer, Alberta]]). Global Calgary began production of Global Lethbridge's newscasts in mid-September, and later in the year Global BC took over CHEK Victoria, Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, Global Winnipeg and Global Montreal. In August 2009, production for Global News Montreal moved from Vancouver to Edmonton. The stations whose controls were taken over began using [[virtual set]]s. In September 2009, CHBC's controls were moved to Calgary (master control) and Vancouver (production control), and the station launched its own virtual set in July 2010.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Shaw Media announced that new weekday local morning shows would be launched on Global Toronto, [[CKND-DT|Global Winnipeg]], [[CFSK-DT|Global Saskatoon]], [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]] and [[CIHF-DT|Global Maritimes]] in late 2011. Local Sunday morning newscasts were also announced for Global Edmonton and Global Calgary, which launched in September 2011. The increase in news programming is part of a benefits package that Shaw Media has promised to fulfill as a condition to purchasing the network.<ref name=\"PR110531\">[http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html Global News redefines morning television in Toronto with The Morning Show featuring the return of Liza Fromer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702093852/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html |date=2011-07-02 }}, Global press release, May 31, 2011.

The previously announced weekday morning newscasts on Global Montreal and Global Maritimes were also confirmed to launch in fall 2012 on dates yet to be determined (their launches were later postponed to early 2013). Local morning newscasts on Global BC, Global Edmonton and Global Calgary were also expanded, with the weekday morning newscasts on all three stations lengthened to four hours on August 27, and the Sunday morning news programs expanding to three hours starting September 2, 2012.  ''16:9'' was also moved from Saturdays to Friday nights, and Global News' website also received a redesign in early 2013 with compatibility for mobile devices in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|title=Global News Boosts Local Programming Across the Country|publisher=Broadcaster Magazine|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=April 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602051414/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|archivedate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Centralization ===\nOn April 9, 2015, Shaw announced cutbacks of Global's local news operations and a subsequent re-organization. Under these changes, which began to take effect in August 2015, production of late night and weekend newscasts in markets outside of Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto, are centralized out of Global's studios in Toronto. Anchors and meteorologists are provided by the centralized news operation, while local stories are presented by the station's reporters.<ref name=faguy-faking>{{cite web|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Another step in Global\u2019s faking of local news|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/08/17/global-outsourced-news-review/|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocal morning shows in these markets also switched to a hybrid local/national format with an eight-minute long national segment every half-hour. Local morning shows and evening newscasts otherwise continue to be produced locally. Troy Reeb, Global's senior vice president of news and station operations, explained that these changes would allow individual stations to devote more resources to the creation of local news content for television and digital platforms, and reduce redundancy in their coverage of national headlines. Reeb also explained that the changes were meant to allow staff reductions, whilst allowing the network to \"find innovative ways\" to distribute news content; at least 80 jobs were lost nationwide as part of the process.<ref name=global-2015changes>{{cite web|title=Global News announces significant changes to how news is produced|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1930342/global-news-announces-significant-changes-to-how-news-is-produced/|website=Global News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=gazette-globalchanges>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global TV cuts staff in Montreal, will anchor some local newscasts from Toronto|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-tv-cuts-staff-in-montreal-will-anchor-some-local-newscasts-from-toronto|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Montreal Gazette|date=April 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, Global announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.

Shaw had previously announced that it would extend its late newscasts in Halifax, Montreal, and New Brunswick to a full hour; to compensate for the change, Global Montreal instead introduced a half-hour noon newscast, and expanded its evening news to an hour. In markets with hour-long late newscasts, ''The Late Show'' is tape-delayed to air at the top of the hour instead.<ref name=gazette-mtlnews>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global Montreal adding more local newscasts this fall|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-montreal-adding-more-local-newscasts-this-fall|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=Montreal Gazette}}</ref><ref name=fagstein-lateshowchanges>{{cite web|title=Global Montreal planning a noon local newscast this fall (but why?)|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/06/03/global-montreal-planning-a-noon-local-newscast/|website=Fagstein|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nCentralization of news anchors has been partially reverted as of January 2019. 11pm newscasts east of Toronto are still anchored from Toronto, however Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, and Global Winnipeg no longer use Toronto anchors for their 10pm local newscasts. Global Regina and Global Saskatoon have since centralized their newscast production, with all of Global Saskatoon's newscasts, with the exception of ''Global News Morning'', being anchored out of Regina.

Similar to the proposed Global News 1 concept, users can select their region from a list of Global markets to receive local news and weather in the ticker on the side of the screen. The content of the newscasts are nationally produced using Global's multi-market anchors in [[CIII-DT|Toronto]] and Global BC1's anchors. If a local market is selected, the feed will be replaced with that market's local newscast at their scheduled airing times. Currently, feeds from [[Global BC|BC]], [[Global Edmonton|Edmonton]], [[Global Calgary|Calgary]], and [[Global Toronto|Toronto]] are available, with more to come. Unlike the other channels available for streaming on Global TV, the Global News channel does not require a sign-in by a [[Cable television|TV provider]] and can be accessed completely free of charge.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/6610229/global-tv-app/</ref>\n\n== Global News Radio ==\nIn 2017, Corus Radio began to re-brand [[news talk]] and [[all-news]] radio stations in major markets under the banner '''Global News Radio''' to create [[synergy|synergies]] with its television news programming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/177034/chqt-inews-880-edmonton-rebrands-today-as-global-n|title=CHQT (iNews 880)/Edmonton Rebrands Today As Global News Radio 880 Edmonton|work=All Access|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cartt.ca/article/corus-rebrands-another-news-talk-station|title=Corus rebrands another news-talk station|work=Cartt.ca|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCurrent stations operating under the branding include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] version of the newscast, titled ''Global National Mandarin'', launched on January 23, 2012 with anchor Carol Wang, and is seen weeknights on [[Shaw Multicultural Channel]] in Vancouver and Calgary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/890821/global-news-and-shaw-multicultural-channel-launch-global-national-mandarin-newscast|title=Global News and Shaw Multicultural Channel Launch Global National Mandarin Newscast|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the network extended its [[CIII-DT|Toronto owned-and-operated station's]] morning program (''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'') by 30 minutes, with this additional half-hour airing across its other owned-and-operated stations;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1087965/global-news-takes-breakfast-to-new-heights-with-a-national-version-of-the-morning-show|title=Global News Takes Breakfast to New Heights With a National Version of the Morning Show|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}</ref> prior to this, Global did not air a national [[morning show]]. In addition, the network's owned-and-operated stations in select markets produce their own local morning shows (see [[#Local programs|below]]); stations which do not produce a local morning show either air the morning show from a larger market, or run daytime programming repeated from [[Shaw Media]]'s cable [[specialty channel]]s, such as ''Crash Test Mommy'' and ''The Mom Show''.\n\nGlobal launched its first investigative [[newsmagazine]] series on November 30, 2008.  The weekly program, titled ''[[16x9 - The Bigger Picture]]'', features a high-gloss, tabloid format, and is the network's first foray into the field long occupied by CTV's ''[[W-FIVE]]'' and CBC's ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|the fifth estate]]''. Global also formerly aired a weekly [[Documentary film|documentary]] series, ''[[Global Currents]]''.\n\nDuring the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]], Global News also produced a weekly series, ''Focus: Decision Canada'', covering news and issues in the election campaign.

The long-dominant [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]] Vancouver (BCTV) had been an exception; its news operation was renamed ''BCTV News on Global'' when it became a Global owned-and-operated in 2001, and its individual newscast titles (e.g. ''News Hour'') were also retained.\n\nAs part of a network-wide branding overhaul, local newscast titles and timeslots were standardized effective February 6, 2006,<ref>[http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html Global News Brings Enhanced National and Local News Package] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928054053/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html |date=2009-09-28 }}, Global press release, February 1, 2006.

The only station that did not follow the BCTV model is [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna, which has kept its call sign as part of its news branding. As of 2011, [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna have rebranded their news operations as ''Global News Okanagan''.

The company stated this would allow all of its stations to make a transition to high definition broadcasting, and create around 50 new jobs at the four stations. Approximately 250 positions were to be eliminated in the other stations, the majority of which were behind-the-scenes/technical positions.<ref>{{cite news |title=CanWest To Launch State-of-the-Art Broadcast Centres; Cuts Jobs |url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |accessdate=12 April 2019 |work=Channel Canada |date=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321225015/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nA press release from the company has also stated that on-air talent (including weather anchors), reporters, producers, photographers, editors, and other news gathering positions will remain at the affected stations. Global Edmonton took over production of Global Maritimes' newscasts in mid-August 2008, and on September 4, 2008, took over production of all newscasts at [[CHCA-TV]] (the [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] station in [[Red Deer, Alberta]]). Global Calgary began production of Global Lethbridge's newscasts in mid-September, and later in the year Global BC took over CHEK Victoria, Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, Global Winnipeg and Global Montreal. In August 2009, production for Global News Montreal moved from Vancouver to Edmonton. The stations whose controls were taken over began using [[virtual set]]s. In September 2009, CHBC's controls were moved to Calgary (master control) and Vancouver (production control), and the station launched its own virtual set in July 2010.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Shaw Media announced that new weekday local morning shows would be launched on Global Toronto, [[CKND-DT|Global Winnipeg]], [[CFSK-DT|Global Saskatoon]], [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]] and [[CIHF-DT|Global Maritimes]] in late 2011. Local Sunday morning newscasts were also announced for Global Edmonton and Global Calgary, which launched in September 2011. The increase in news programming is part of a benefits package that Shaw Media has promised to fulfill as a condition to purchasing the network.<ref name=\"PR110531\">[http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html Global News redefines morning television in Toronto with The Morning Show featuring the return of Liza Fromer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702093852/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html |date=2011-07-02 }}, Global press release, May 31, 2011.

The previously announced weekday morning newscasts on Global Montreal and Global Maritimes were also confirmed to launch in fall 2012 on dates yet to be determined (their launches were later postponed to early 2013). Local morning newscasts on Global BC, Global Edmonton and Global Calgary were also expanded, with the weekday morning newscasts on all three stations lengthened to four hours on August 27, and the Sunday morning news programs expanding to three hours starting September 2, 2012.  ''16:9'' was also moved from Saturdays to Friday nights, and Global News' website also received a redesign in early 2013 with compatibility for mobile devices in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|title=Global News Boosts Local Programming Across the Country|publisher=Broadcaster Magazine|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=April 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602051414/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|archivedate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Centralization ===\nOn April 9, 2015, Shaw announced cutbacks of Global's local news operations and a subsequent re-organization. Under these changes, which began to take effect in August 2015, production of late night and weekend newscasts in markets outside of Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto, are centralized out of Global's studios in Toronto. Anchors and meteorologists are provided by the centralized news operation, while local stories are presented by the station's reporters.<ref name=faguy-faking>{{cite web|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Another step in Global\u2019s faking of local news|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/08/17/global-outsourced-news-review/|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocal morning shows in these markets also switched to a hybrid local/national format with an eight-minute long national segment every half-hour. Local morning shows and evening newscasts otherwise continue to be produced locally. Troy Reeb, Global's senior vice president of news and station operations, explained that these changes would allow individual stations to devote more resources to the creation of local news content for television and digital platforms, and reduce redundancy in their coverage of national headlines. Reeb also explained that the changes were meant to allow staff reductions, whilst allowing the network to \"find innovative ways\" to distribute news content; at least 80 jobs were lost nationwide as part of the process.<ref name=global-2015changes>{{cite web|title=Global News announces significant changes to how news is produced|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1930342/global-news-announces-significant-changes-to-how-news-is-produced/|website=Global News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=gazette-globalchanges>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global TV cuts staff in Montreal, will anchor some local newscasts from Toronto|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-tv-cuts-staff-in-montreal-will-anchor-some-local-newscasts-from-toronto|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Montreal Gazette|date=April 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, Global announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''. Late newscasts were kept at or shortened to 35 minutes in markets where ''The Late Show'' was to air in simulcast with [[CBS]] at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. for [[simsub]] purposes, including Halifax, Kelowna, Montreal, New Brunswick, Toronto, and Vancouver. Shaw had previously announced that it would extend its late newscasts in Halifax, Montreal, and New Brunswick to a full hour; to compensate for the change, Global Montreal instead introduced a half-hour noon newscast, and expanded its evening news to an hour. In markets with hour-long late newscasts, ''The Late Show'' is tape-delayed to air at the top of the hour instead.<ref name=gazette-mtlnews>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global Montreal adding more local newscasts this fall|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-montreal-adding-more-local-newscasts-this-fall|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=Montreal Gazette}}</ref><ref name=fagstein-lateshowchanges>{{cite web|title=Global Montreal planning a noon local newscast this fall (but why?)|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/06/03/global-montreal-planning-a-noon-local-newscast/|website=Fagstein|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nCentralization of news anchors has been partially reverted as of January 2019. 11pm newscasts east of Toronto are still anchored from Toronto, however Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, and Global Winnipeg no longer use Toronto anchors for their 10pm local newscasts. Global Regina and Global Saskatoon have since centralized their newscast production, with all of Global Saskatoon's newscasts, with the exception of ''Global News Morning'', being anchored out of Regina. Weekend newscasts have not changed and are still anchored out of Toronto from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia.\n\n==News channels==\n{{Main|Global News: BC 1}}\nOn January 11, 2012, [[Shaw Media]] announced it had filed an application with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to launch a 24-hour Vancouver-based regional news network (to be licensed as a [[Category B services|Category B]] [[digital cable]] [[specialty channel]]).

Similar to the proposed Global News 1 concept, users can select their region from a list of Global markets to receive local news and weather in the ticker on the side of the screen. The content of the newscasts are nationally produced using Global's multi-market anchors in [[CIII-DT|Toronto]] and Global BC1's anchors. If a local market is selected, the feed will be replaced with that market's local newscast at their scheduled airing times. Currently, feeds from [[Global BC|BC]], [[Global Edmonton|Edmonton]], [[Global Calgary|Calgary]], and [[Global Toronto|Toronto]] are available, with more to come. Unlike the other channels available for streaming on Global TV, the Global News channel does not require a sign-in by a [[Cable television|TV provider]] and can be accessed completely free of charge.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/6610229/global-tv-app/</ref>\n\n== Global News Radio ==\nIn 2017, Corus Radio began to re-brand [[news talk]] and [[all-news]] radio stations in major markets under the banner '''Global News Radio''' to create [[synergy|synergies]] with its television news programming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/177034/chqt-inews-880-edmonton-rebrands-today-as-global-n|title=CHQT (iNews 880)/Edmonton Rebrands Today As Global News Radio 880 Edmonton|work=All Access|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cartt.ca/article/corus-rebrands-another-news-talk-station|title=Corus rebrands another news-talk station|work=Cartt.ca|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCurrent stations operating under the branding include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
