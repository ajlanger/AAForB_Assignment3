The deal has been cited as one of the worst in Mets history but was not viewed as unreasonable at the time given Ryan's relatively unremarkable numbers as a Met. <ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/>\n\nIn his [[1972 Major League Baseball season|first season]] with the [[1972 California Angels season|Angels]], Ryan was given a chance to pitch regularly as a starter for the first time in his career, mainly because by then he had fulfilled his military obligation and no longer had to commute to Houston every other week. He had a league-leading 329 strikeouts\u2014nearly a third more than the AL runner-up, and to that point, the fourth-highest total of the 20th century. Within five seasons, the season was only Ryan's fourth-highest strikeout total.<ref name=data/> He also set a still-standing Major League record by allowing only 5.26 hits per nine innings, breaking [[Luis Tiant]]'s 5.30 in 1968, as well as posting a 2.28 [[earned run average]] that year,<ref name=data/> to date the second lowest in franchise history, trailing only [[Dean Chance]]'s 1.65 in 1964. Though Ryan's actual winning percentage hovered only slightly over .500, his strikeouts and no-hitters brought him media attention. Meanwhile, Fregosi failed to produce as a Met, making no significant contribution to the [[1973 New York Mets season|Mets' 1973]] pennant-winning campaign; he was sold to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] mid-season.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the Angels were a sub-.500 team and remained one for much of his time there, Ryan managed to post some winning records, notably 19\u201316 in 1972, 21\u201316 in 1973 and 22\u201316 in 1974 (the 22 wins tied what remains the Angels franchise record, set by [[Clyde Wright]] in 1970). He finished 2nd in the Cy Young balloting (losing to [[Jim Palmer]] 88 to 62) in 1973. It was the closest he ever came in the Cy Young balloting. Ryan also led the league in losses in 1976 with a 17\u201318 record (one short of the franchise record for losses).<ref name=data/> In the early 1970s, many teams used a four-man rotation and expected the starter to complete the game; thus most games Ryan started ended in a decision.\n\n[[File:Nolan Ryan 1972.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Ryan, circa 1972]]\n\nOn July 9, 1972, Ryan struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 3\u20130 win over the [[1972 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]; he became the seventh American League pitcher to accomplish the [[immaculate inning]], and the first (and currently only) pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat in both leagues. (On April 19, 1968, he had struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 2\u20131 win over the [[1968 St. Louis Cardinals season|St.&nbsp;Louis Cardinals]], becoming the eighth National League pitcher and the 14th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat.)\n\nIn 1973, Ryan set his first major record when he [[strikeout|struck out]] 383 batters in one season, beating [[Sandy Koufax]]'s old mark by one.

It was the first of two homers in Ryan's career and produced half of the six RBIs he got that year.<ref name=data/> On July 4 of that [[1980 Major League Baseball season|season]], at [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]], Ryan recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, the victim being [[C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo]] of the [[1980 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] (Ger\u00f3nimo had also been [[Bob Gibson]]'s 3,000th strikeout victim, in 1974). Ryan got his third taste of postseason play in 1980, but the Astros were stopped one game short of the World Series.\n\nIn the [[1980 National League Championship Series|1980 NLCS]] versus the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Ryan pitched well in Game 2, leaving the game tied 2\u20132 in the seventh (having contributed to both [[1980 Houston Astros season|Astros]] runs with a run scored following a walk, and a sacrifice bunt leading to a run) but again got a no decision in a game that went extra innings. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan and the Astros held a 5\u20132 lead entering the 8th inning. But Ryan allowed three consecutive singles before walking in the third run. The Houston bullpen allowed the Phillies to take a 7\u20135 lead, and only a game-tying Astro rally permitted Ryan to escape the loss.\n\nOn September 26, 1981, Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter, breaking Koufax's mark while becoming the third pitcher to throw a no-hitter in each league. That season, his 1.69 ERA won the [[National League]] [[earned run average|ERA]] title.<ref name=data/>\n\nFacing the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1981 National League Division Series|1981 NLDS]], Ryan threw a complete game 2-hitter in the opener, outlasting the Dodgers' rookie sensation [[Fernando Valenzuela]].

Ryan had a shaky start in Game&nbsp;2, taking the loss. He returned in Game&nbsp;5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, but one of those hits was a [[Darryl Strawberry]] home run which tied the game at 1\u20131, as [[Dwight Gooden]] matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.\n\nIn 1987, Ryan led the major leagues in both ERA (2.76) and strikeouts (270) at the age of 40\u2014but finished 8\u201316 as the result of extremely poor run support.

He became the first player to play for all four MLB original expansion teams: the Mets, Angels, Houston Colt .45s/ Astros and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers. (Ryan was joined in this category by [[Darren Oliver]], who made his major league debut as Ryan's teammate in September 1993. Oliver's father [[Bob Oliver|Bob]] had also been a teammate of Ryan's, with the Angels from 1972 to 1974.) In 1989, he went 16\u201310 and led the league with 301 strikeouts.<ref name=data/> Against the [[Oakland Athletics]] on August 22, Ryan struck out [[Rickey Henderson]] to become the only pitcher to record 5,000 career strikeouts.

On August 6, 1992, Ryan had the first and only ejection of his career when he was ejected after engaging in a shouting match with [[Oakland Athletics]] outfielder [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] with 2 outs in the 9th inning.\n\nBefore the 1993 season began, Ryan announced that he would retire as a player at the end of that season. On August 4, just before the end, Ryan had yet another high-profile moment\u2014this time an on-the-mound fight. After Ryan hit [[Robin Ventura]] of the [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] with a pitch, Ventura charged the mound in order to fight Ryan, who was 20 years his senior. Ryan secured the 26-year-old Ventura in a headlock with his left arm, while pummeling Ventura's head with his right fist six times before catcher [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]] was able to pull Ventura away from Ryan. Ryan stated afterwards it was the same maneuver he used on steers he had to brand on his Texas ranch. Videos of the incident were played that evening throughout the country. While Ventura was ejected, Ryan\u2013who had barely moved from his spot on the mound in the fracas\u2013was allowed to remain in the game. White Sox manager [[Gene Lamont]] vehemently argued this, leading to his own ejection.  Ryan pitched a hitless ball game the rest of the way. He had determined to be more aggressive after coming out on the wrong side of an altercation with [[Dave Winfield]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=Denne H.|title=Raging Ryan Strikes Ventura|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=August 5, 1993|page=C1}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Arlington Stadium 1992 - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Ryan on the mound during a 1992 home game at [[Arlington Stadium]]]]\n\nRyan's arm gave out in Seattle on September 22, 1993, when he tore a [[ligament]]. The injury ended his career two starts earlier than planned, at age 46. Ryan briefly attempted to pitch past the injury, and he threw one additional pitch after tearing his ligament. With his injured arm, his final pitch was measured at {{convert|98|mph}}. Ryan's last start was his career worst; he allowed a single, four walks, and a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in the top of the first without recording an out. It was his record-setting 10th grand slam given up of his career. (Ryan left trailing 5\u20130, and the fourth walk was completed by a reliever after Ryan's injury, but credited to Ryan.)

The deal has been cited as one of the worst in Mets history but was not viewed as unreasonable at the time given Ryan's relatively unremarkable numbers as a Met. <ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/>\n\nIn his [[1972 Major League Baseball season|first season]] with the [[1972 California Angels season|Angels]], Ryan was given a chance to pitch regularly as a starter for the first time in his career, mainly because by then he had fulfilled his military obligation and no longer had to commute to Houston every other week. He had a league-leading 329 strikeouts\u2014nearly a third more than the AL runner-up, and to that point, the fourth-highest total of the 20th century. Within five seasons, the season was only Ryan's fourth-highest strikeout total.<ref name=data/> He also set a still-standing Major League record by allowing only 5.26 hits per nine innings, breaking [[Luis Tiant]]'s 5.30 in 1968, as well as posting a 2.28 [[earned run average]] that year,<ref name=data/> to date the second lowest in franchise history, trailing only [[Dean Chance]]'s 1.65 in 1964. Though Ryan's actual winning percentage hovered only slightly over .500, his strikeouts and no-hitters brought him media attention. Meanwhile, Fregosi failed to produce as a Met, making no significant contribution to the [[1973 New York Mets season|Mets' 1973]] pennant-winning campaign; he was sold to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] mid-season.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the Angels were a sub-.500 team and remained one for much of his time there, Ryan managed to post some winning records, notably 19\u201316 in 1972, 21\u201316 in 1973 and 22\u201316 in 1974 (the 22 wins tied what remains the Angels franchise record, set by [[Clyde Wright]] in 1970). He finished 2nd in the Cy Young balloting (losing to [[Jim Palmer]] 88 to 62) in 1973. It was the closest he ever came in the Cy Young balloting. Ryan also led the league in losses in 1976 with a 17\u201318 record (one short of the franchise record for losses).<ref name=data/> In the early 1970s, many teams used a four-man rotation and expected the starter to complete the game; thus most games Ryan started ended in a decision.\n\n[[File:Nolan Ryan 1972.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Ryan, circa 1972]]\n\nOn July 9, 1972, Ryan struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 3\u20130 win over the [[1972 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]; he became the seventh American League pitcher to accomplish the [[immaculate inning]], and the first (and currently only) pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat in both leagues. (On April 19, 1968, he had struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 2\u20131 win over the [[1968 St. Louis Cardinals season|St.&nbsp;Louis Cardinals]], becoming the eighth National League pitcher and the 14th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat.)\n\nIn 1973, Ryan set his first major record when he [[strikeout|struck out]] 383 batters in one season, beating [[Sandy Koufax]]'s old mark by one.

That season, his 1.69 ERA won the [[National League]] [[earned run average|ERA]] title.<ref name=data/>\n\nFacing the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1981 National League Division Series|1981 NLDS]], Ryan threw a complete game 2-hitter in the opener, outlasting the Dodgers' rookie sensation [[Fernando Valenzuela]]. It was Ryan's second and last career postseason win. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan left trailing 3\u20130 and took the loss.\n\n[[File:Nolan Ryan in Atlanta close-up.jpg|thumb|Ryan pitching for the Astros in 1983]]\nBy the end of the 1982 season, both Ryan and [[Steve Carlton]] were approaching [[Walter Johnson]]'s all-time strikeout record, sometimes passing one another's career totals in successive starts. On April 27, 1983, Ryan won the race with his 3,509th whiff, against [[Brad Mills (infielder)|Brad Mills]] of the [[1983 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. (Carlton reached the same mark two weeks after Ryan, and [[Gaylord Perry]] did so later that season.)

Ryan had a shaky start in Game&nbsp;2, taking the loss. He returned in Game&nbsp;5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, but one of those hits was a [[Darryl Strawberry]] home run which tied the game at 1\u20131, as [[Dwight Gooden]] matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.\n\nIn 1987, Ryan led the major leagues in both ERA (2.76) and strikeouts (270) at the age of 40\u2014but finished 8\u201316 as the result of extremely poor run support. (The Astros scored a total of 27 runs in his 16 losses--an average of 1.69 runs per game.) Despite his .333 winning percentage, Ryan tied for 5th place in the 1987 Cy Young voting.<ref name=data/>  Ryan hit his second and last career home run in a 12\u20133 win on May 1, 1987, against the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nIn nine seasons as a pitcher with the Astros, Ryan compiled a 106\u201394 record in 282 starts, a 3.13 ERA, 1.20 WHIP, with 796 walks and 1866 strikeouts in 1854 innings.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com2\"/>\n\n===Texas Rangers (1989\u20131993)===\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = NolanRyanRangers.png\n|Name   = Nolan Ryan\n|Number = 34\n|Team   = Texas Rangers (baseball)\n|Display = Texas Rangers\n|Year   = 1996\n|}}\nRyan left Houston after a contract dispute following the 1988 season and signed with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] at age 42. He became the first player to play for all four MLB original expansion teams: the Mets, Angels, Houston Colt .45s/ Astros and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers. (Ryan was joined in this category by [[Darren Oliver]], who made his major league debut as Ryan's teammate in September 1993. Oliver's father [[Bob Oliver|Bob]] had also been a teammate of Ryan's, with the Angels from 1972 to 1974.) In 1989, he went 16\u201310 and led the league with 301 strikeouts.<ref name=data/> Against the [[Oakland Athletics]] on August 22, Ryan struck out [[Rickey Henderson]] to become the only pitcher to record 5,000 career strikeouts. (Following the game, Henderson was quoted as saying, \"If he ain't struck you out, then you ain't nobody.\") His 4,999th and 5,001st strikeouts were against the same man, Athletics catcher [[Ron Hassey]]. Two years later, at 44, Ryan finished fifth in the league in ERA (2.91) and third in strikeouts (203).<ref name=data/>\n\nIn 1990, Ryan threw his sixth no-hitter on June 11 against the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]], and earned his 300th [[win (baseball)|win]] on July 31 against the [[1990 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/sports/ryan-savors-his-milestone-with-a-feeling-of-relief.html|work=The New York Times|first=Malcolm|last=Moran|title=Ryan Savors His Milestone With a Feeling of Relief|date=August 2, 1990}}</ref> On May 1, 1991, at age 44, Ryan extended his record by throwing the seventh no-hitter of his career, striking out [[Roberto Alomar]] of the [[1991 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] for the final out. On August 6, 1992, Ryan had the first and only ejection of his career when he was ejected after engaging in a shouting match with [[Oakland Athletics]] outfielder [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] with 2 outs in the 9th inning.\n\nBefore the 1993 season began, Ryan announced that he would retire as a player at the end of that season. On August 4, just before the end, Ryan had yet another high-profile moment\u2014this time an on-the-mound fight. After Ryan hit [[Robin Ventura]] of the [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] with a pitch, Ventura charged the mound in order to fight Ryan, who was 20 years his senior. Ryan secured the 26-year-old Ventura in a headlock with his left arm, while pummeling Ventura's head with his right fist six times before catcher [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]] was able to pull Ventura away from Ryan. Ryan stated afterwards it was the same maneuver he used on steers he had to brand on his Texas ranch. Videos of the incident were played that evening throughout the country. While Ventura was ejected, Ryan\u2013who had barely moved from his spot on the mound in the fracas\u2013was allowed to remain in the game. White Sox manager [[Gene Lamont]] vehemently argued this, leading to his own ejection.  Ryan pitched a hitless ball game the rest of the way. He had determined to be more aggressive after coming out on the wrong side of an altercation with [[Dave Winfield]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=Denne H.|title=Raging Ryan Strikes Ventura|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=August 5, 1993|page=C1}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Arlington Stadium 1992 - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Ryan on the mound during a 1992 home game at [[Arlington Stadium]]]]\n\nRyan's arm gave out in Seattle on September 22, 1993, when he tore a [[ligament]]. The injury ended his career two starts earlier than planned, at age 46. Ryan briefly attempted to pitch past the injury, and he threw one additional pitch after tearing his ligament. With his injured arm, his final pitch was measured at {{convert|98|mph}}. Ryan's last start was his career worst; he allowed a single, four walks, and a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in the top of the first without recording an out. It was his record-setting 10th grand slam given up of his career. (Ryan left trailing 5\u20130, and the fourth walk was completed by a reliever after Ryan's injury, but credited to Ryan.) Greg Myers of the California Angels was the last strikeout victim of Nolan Ryan's career, on September 17, 1993.<ref>''Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records'', p.32, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, {{ISBN|978-1-55365-507-7}}</ref>\n\nRyan finished his career having played in a major league record 27 seasons. He was the final active player from the 1960s to retire from Major League Baseball, outlasting [[Carlton Fisk]] (the final active position player) by three months.\n\nIn five seasons with the Rangers, Ryan had a 51\u201339 record, a 3.43 ERA, 1.12 WHIP, with 353 walks and 939 strikeouts in 840 innings over 129 starts.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com2\"/>\n\n===Career statistics===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[Win (baseball)|W]]\n|[[Loss (baseball)#Losing pitcher|L]]\n|PCT\n|[[Earned run average|ERA]]\n|[[Games played|G]]\n|[[Games started|GS]]\n|[[Complete game|CG]]\n|[[Shutouts in baseball|SHO]]\n|[[Save (baseball)|SV]]\n|[[Innings pitched|IP]]\n|[[Hit (baseball)|H]]\n|[[Earned run|ER]]\n|[[Run (baseball)|R]]\n|[[Home run|HR]]\n|[[Base on balls|BB]]\n|[[Strikeout|SO]]\n|[[Wild pitch|WP]]\n|[[Hit by pitch|HBP]]\n|-\n|324\n|292\n|.526\n|3.19\n|807\n|773\n|222\n|61\n|3\n|5386.0\n|3923\n|1911\n|2178\n|321\n|2795\n|5714\n|277\n|158\n|}\n\n===Seven no-hitters===\nRyan threw a record seven no-hitters during his major league career, three more than any other pitcher.
