It is often described as having been named after [[San Andreas Lake]], a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates. However, according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908, Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/facts.php|title=Earthquake Facts|website=earthquake.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-05-28}}</ref> Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California.\n\nIn 1953, geologist [[Thomas Dibblee]] concluded that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault. A project called the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth|San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD)]] near [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]], was drilled through the fault during 2004\u20132007 to collect material and make physical and chemical observations to better understand fault behavior.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/safod_pbo.php|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Fault zones ==\n\n=== Northern ===\n{{see also|Calaveras Fault||Hayward Fault Zone}}\n[[File:Eq-prob.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|A map displaying each of the seven major faults in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the probability of an [[Magnitude (earthquake)|M6.7]] earthquake or higher occurring on each fault between 2003 and 2032.|alt=A map tracing all the faults in the Bay Area, and listing probabilities of earthquakes occurring on them.]]\n\nThe northern segment of the fault runs from [[Hollister, California|Hollister]], through the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], epicenter of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], then up the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], where it was first identified by [[Andrew Lawson|Professor Lawson]] in 1895, then offshore at [[Daly City, California|Daly City]] near [[Mussel Rock]]. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. The fault returns onshore at [[Bolinas Lagoon]] just north of [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]] in [[Marin County]]. It returns underwater through the linear trough of [[Tomales Bay]] which separates the [[Point Reyes Peninsula]] from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at [[Fort Ross]]. (In this region around the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] several significant \"sister faults\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the [[Gualala River]] flows. It goes back offshore at [[Point Arena]]. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears [[Cape Mendocino]], where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the [[Mendocino Triple Junction]].\n\n=== Central ===\nThe central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to [[Hollister, California|Hollister]]. While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes, the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called [[aseismic creep]], where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes.k\n\n=== Southern ===\n\n{{Location map many\n| Salton Trough\n| width       = 400\n| float       = \n| border      = \n| caption     = Southern San Andreas Fault.

These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range. In [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the [[Antelope Valley Freeway]]. The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of [[Elizabeth Lake, California|Elizabeth Lake]]. As it passes the towns of [[Gorman, California|Gorman]], [[Tejon Pass]] and [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]], the fault begins to bend northward, forming the \"Big Bend\". This [[Transpression#Restraining bend|restraining bend]] is thought to be where the fault locks up in [[Southern California]], with an earthquake-recurrence interval of roughly 140\u2013160 years. Northwest of Frazier Park, the fault runs through the [[Carrizo Plain]], a long, treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible. The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain.\n\nThe southern segment, which stretches from [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]] in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]] all the way to the [[Salton Sea]], is capable of an 8.1-magnitude earthquake. At its closest, this fault passes about {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the northeast of Los Angeles. Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and surrounding areas, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 8, 2010 |author=Rong-Gong Lin II |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/10/san-andreas-capable-of-80-earthquake-over-340-mile-swath-of-california-researchers-say.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=San Andreas fault capable of magnitude 8.1 earthquake over 340-mile swath of California, researchers say |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== Plate boundaries ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[Pacific Plate]], to the west of the fault, is moving in a northwest direction while the [[North American Plate]] to the east is moving toward the southwest, but relatively southeast under the influence of [[plate tectonics]]. The rate of slippage averages about {{convert|33|to|37|mm|in|sp=us}} a year across California.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1990/1515/ |title=Present-Day Crustal Movements and the Mechanics of Cyclic Deformation |work=The San Andreas Fault System, California |last=Wallace |first=Robert E. |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>\n\nThe southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault. The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges. The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward. This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, and to a lesser but still significant extent, the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] (the location of the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] in 1989).\n\nStudies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults. The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains called the [[Walker Lane]] or Eastern California Shear Zone. The reason for this is not clear. Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing. One hypothesis \u2013 which gained interest following the [[Landers, California earthquake|Landers earthquake]] in 1992 \u2013 suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane.\n\nAssuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized, projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault, including Los Angeles, will eventually slide past San Francisco, then continue northwestward toward the [[Aleutian Trench]], over a period of perhaps twenty million years.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:San Andreas Fault Sequential Diagrams.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Tectonic evolution of the San Andreas Fault.]]\nThe San Andreas began to form in the mid [[Cenozoic]] about 30 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]] (million years ago).<ref>[[Tanya Atwater|Atwater, T.]], 1970, Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America</ref> At this time, a [[Seafloor spreading|spreading center]] between the Pacific Plate and the [[Farallon Plate]] (which is now mostly subducted, with remnants including the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]], [[Rivera Plate]], [[Cocos Plate]], and the [[Nazca Plate]]) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America. As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates, the spreading ridge began to be \"subducted\", creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries. These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault. It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]], separation of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and rotation of the [[Transverse Range]].\n\nThe main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Powell, R.E. |author2=Weldon, R.J. |year=1992 |title=Evolution of the San Andreas fault |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=20 |pages=431\u2013468|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.002243 |bibcode=1992AREPS..20..431P }}</ref> The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well-Fenner-[[San Francisquito Canyon|San Francisquito]] fault zone around 22\u201313 Ma. This system added the [[San Gabriel Fault]] as a primary focus of movement between 10\u20135 Ma. Currently, it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the [[Eastern California Shear Zone]]. This complicated evolution, especially along the southern segment, is mostly caused by either the \"Big Bend\" and/or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and its surrounding branches.\n\n== Study ==\n\n=== Early years===\nThe fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor [[Andrew Lawson]] in 1895 and named by him after the ''[[Laguna de San Andreas]]'', a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco. Eleven years later, Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. Large-scale (hundreds of miles) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and [[Thomas Dibblee]]. This idea, which was considered radical at the time, has since been vindicated by modern [[plate tectonics]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Mason L.

Following recorded seismic events in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966, scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993. It eventually occurred in [[Parkfield earthquake|2004]]. Due to the frequency of predictable activity, Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research.\n\nIn 2004, work began just north of Parkfield on the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth]] (SAFOD). The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly {{convert|3|km|mi}} into the Earth's crust and into the San Andreas Fault. An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/safod_pbo.html |title=San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth |work=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001112157/http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/safod_pbo.html |archivedate=2005-10-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies.

Moreover, the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault, i.e. the region around Los Angeles, because massive earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central ([[Fort Tejon earthquake|1857]]) and northern ([[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906]]) segments of the fault, while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years. According to this study, a massive earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]\u2013[[Indio, California|Indio]] metropolitan area and other cities in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]] counties in California, and [[Mexicali Municipality]] in [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]]. It would be strongly felt (and potentially cause significant damage) throughout much of [[Southern California]], including densely populated areas of [[Los Angeles County]], [[Ventura County]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[San Diego County]], [[Ensenada Municipality]] and [[Tijuana Municipality]], [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]], [[San Luis Rio Colorado]] in [[Sonora]] and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], [[Arizona]].

Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years. The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time-correlated events. However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=Earthquakes Along The Cascadia And San Andreas Faults May Be Linked, Affecting Risk To San Francisco Bay Region |author=BSSA |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080403131923.htm |publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]] |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== Earthquakes ==\n{{See also|List of earthquakes in California}}\nThe San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times:\n\n* [[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake]]: About {{convert|350|km|mi|sp=us}} were ruptured in central and southern California.

Andreas Fault''' is a continental [[transform fault]] that extends roughly {{convert|1200|km|mi|sp=us}} through [[California]].<ref name=CalTechSanAndreas/> It forms the [[tectonics|tectonic]] boundary between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]], and its motion is [[Fault (geology)#strike-slip faults|right-lateral strike-slip]] (horizontal). The fault divides into three segments, each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk. The slip rate along the fault ranges from {{convert|20|to|35|mm|in|abbr=on}}/yr.<ref name=CalTechSanAndreas>{{cite web |url=http://scedc.caltech.edu/significant/sanandreas.html |title=San Andreas Fault Zone |publisher=[[CalTech]] |accessdate=2017-06-20}}</ref>\n\nThe fault was identified in 1895 by Professor [[Andrew Lawson]] of [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], who discovered the northern zone. It is often described as having been named after [[San Andreas Lake]], a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates. However, according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908, Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/facts.php|title=Earthquake Facts|website=earthquake.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-05-28}}</ref> Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California.\n\nIn 1953, geologist [[Thomas Dibblee]] concluded that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault. A project called the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth|San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD)]] near [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]], was drilled through the fault during 2004\u20132007 to collect material and make physical and chemical observations to better understand fault behavior.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/safod_pbo.php|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Fault zones ==\n\n=== Northern ===\n{{see also|Calaveras Fault||Hayward Fault Zone}}\n[[File:Eq-prob.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|A map displaying each of the seven major faults in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the probability of an [[Magnitude (earthquake)|M6.7]] earthquake or higher occurring on each fault between 2003 and 2032.|alt=A map tracing all the faults in the Bay Area, and listing probabilities of earthquakes occurring on them.]]\n\nThe northern segment of the fault runs from [[Hollister, California|Hollister]], through the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], epicenter of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], then up the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], where it was first identified by [[Andrew Lawson|Professor Lawson]] in 1895, then offshore at [[Daly City, California|Daly City]] near [[Mussel Rock]]. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. The fault returns onshore at [[Bolinas Lagoon]] just north of [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]] in [[Marin County]]. It returns underwater through the linear trough of [[Tomales Bay]] which separates the [[Point Reyes Peninsula]] from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at [[Fort Ross]]. (In this region around the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] several significant \"sister faults\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the [[Gualala River]] flows. It goes back offshore at [[Point Arena]]. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears [[Cape Mendocino]], where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the [[Mendocino Triple Junction]].\n\n=== Central ===\nThe central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to [[Hollister, California|Hollister]]. While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes, the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called [[aseismic creep]], where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes.\n\n=== Southern ===\n\n{{Location map many\n| Salton Trough\n| width       = 400\n| float       = \n| border      = \n| caption     = Southern San Andreas Fault.

Box Canyon, near the [[Salton Sea]], contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americansouthwest.net/california/box_canyon/|title=Box Canyon, near Palm Springs, California|website=www.americansouthwest.net}}</ref> The fault then runs along the southern base of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]], crosses through the [[Cajon Pass]] and continues northwest along the northern base of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range. In [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the [[Antelope Valley Freeway]]. The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of [[Elizabeth Lake, California|Elizabeth Lake]]. As it passes the towns of [[Gorman, California|Gorman]], [[Tejon Pass]] and [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]], the fault begins to bend northward, forming the \"Big Bend\". This [[Transpression#Restraining bend|restraining bend]] is thought to be where the fault locks up in [[Southern California]], with an earthquake-recurrence interval of roughly 140\u2013160 years. Northwest of Frazier Park, the fault runs through the [[Carrizo Plain]], a long, treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible. The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain.\n\nThe southern segment, which stretches from [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]] in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]] all the way to the [[Salton Sea]], is capable of an 8.1-magnitude earthquake. At its closest, this fault passes about {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the northeast of Los Angeles. Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and surrounding areas, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 8, 2010 |author=Rong-Gong Lin II |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/10/san-andreas-capable-of-80-earthquake-over-340-mile-swath-of-california-researchers-say.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=San Andreas fault capable of magnitude 8.1 earthquake over 340-mile swath of California, researchers say |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== Plate boundaries ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[Pacific Plate]], to the west of the fault, is moving in a northwest direction while the [[North American Plate]] to the east is moving toward the southwest, but relatively southeast under the influence of [[plate tectonics]]. The rate of slippage averages about {{convert|33|to|37|mm|in|sp=us}} a year across California.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1990/1515/ |title=Present-Day Crustal Movements and the Mechanics of Cyclic Deformation |work=The San Andreas Fault System, California |last=Wallace |first=Robert E. |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>\n\nThe southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault. The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges. The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward. This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, and to a lesser but still significant extent, the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] (the location of the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] in 1989).\n\nStudies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults. The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains called the [[Walker Lane]] or Eastern California Shear Zone. The reason for this is not clear. Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing. One hypothesis \u2013 which gained interest following the [[Landers, California earthquake|Landers earthquake]] in 1992 \u2013 suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane.\n\nAssuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized, projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault, including Los Angeles, will eventually slide past San Francisco, then continue northwestward toward the [[Aleutian Trench]], over a period of perhaps twenty million years.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:San Andreas Fault Sequential Diagrams.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Tectonic evolution of the San Andreas Fault.]]\nThe San Andreas began to form in the mid [[Cenozoic]] about 30 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]] (million years ago).<ref>[[Tanya Atwater|Atwater, T.]], 1970, Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America</ref> At this time, a [[Seafloor spreading|spreading center]] between the Pacific Plate and the [[Farallon Plate]] (which is now mostly subducted, with remnants including the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]], [[Rivera Plate]], [[Cocos Plate]], and the [[Nazca Plate]]) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America. As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates, the spreading ridge began to be \"subducted\", creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries. These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault. It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]], separation of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and rotation of the [[Transverse Range]].\n\nThe main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Powell, R.E. |author2=Weldon, R.J. |year=1992 |title=Evolution of the San Andreas fault |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=20 |pages=431\u2013468|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.002243 |bibcode=1992AREPS..20..431P }}</ref> The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well-Fenner-[[San Francisquito Canyon|San Francisquito]] fault zone around 22\u201313 Ma. This system added the [[San Gabriel Fault]] as a primary focus of movement between 10\u20135 Ma. Currently, it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the [[Eastern California Shear Zone]]. This complicated evolution, especially along the southern segment, is mostly caused by either the \"Big Bend\" and/or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and its surrounding branches.\n\n== Study ==\n\n=== Early years===\nThe fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor [[Andrew Lawson]] in 1895 and named by him after the ''[[Laguna de San Andreas]]'', a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco. Eleven years later, Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. Large-scale (hundreds of miles) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and [[Thomas Dibblee]]. This idea, which was considered radical at the time, has since been vindicated by modern [[plate tectonics]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Mason L. Hill |author2=Thomas Dibblee |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfvX7KdAcXoC&pg=PA88 |title=San Andreas, Garlock, and Big faults, California |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |year= 1953 |pages=443\u2013458|isbn=978-0-8137-2338-9}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research ===\nSeismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]] in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years. Following recorded seismic events in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966, scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993. It eventually occurred in [[Parkfield earthquake|2004]]. Due to the frequency of predictable activity, Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research.\n\nIn 2004, work began just north of Parkfield on the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth]] (SAFOD).

In particular, scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications.<ref name=\"Gizzi2015\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276453069 |title=Worldwide trends in research on the San Andreas Fault System |author=Gizzi F.T. |journal=[[Arabian Journal of Geosciences]] |year=2015 |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=10893\u201310909 |doi=10.1007/s12517-015-1878-4}}</ref>\n\n=== The next \"Big One\" ===\n[[File:NASA Radar 3-D View of San Andreas Fault.jpg|thumb|[[Radar]] generated 3-D view of the San Andreas Fault, at [[Crystal Springs Reservoir]] near [[San Mateo, California]].<ref>{{cite web |date=June 23, 2009 |author=NASA |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=39018&src=eoa-iotd |title=NASA Radar Provides 3-D View of San Andreas Fault |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>]]\n\nA study published in 2006 in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the [[moment magnitude scale]] to occur.<ref name=\"Yuri\">{{cite journal |url=http://sioviz.ucsd.edu/~fialko/papers/fialkoNature06.pdf |title=Interseismic strain accumulation and the earthquake potential on the southern San Andreas fault System |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=441 |pages=968\u2013971 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nature04797 |author=Fialko, Yuri |pmid=16791192 |issue=7096 |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..968F}}</ref>\nThis study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed. Moreover, the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault, i.e. the region around Los Angeles, because massive earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central ([[Fort Tejon earthquake|1857]]) and northern ([[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906]]) segments of the fault, while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years. According to this study, a massive earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]\u2013[[Indio, California|Indio]] metropolitan area and other cities in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]] counties in California, and [[Mexicali Municipality]] in [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]]. It would be strongly felt (and potentially cause significant damage) throughout much of [[Southern California]], including densely populated areas of [[Los Angeles County]], [[Ventura County]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[San Diego County]], [[Ensenada Municipality]] and [[Tijuana Municipality]], [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]], [[San Luis Rio Colorado]] in [[Sonora]] and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], [[Arizona]]. Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse, as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high (and thus subject to [[soil liquefaction]]). The paper concluded {{Failed verification|date=April 2019}}:\n\n{{quote|The information available suggests that the fault is ready for the next big earthquake but exactly when the triggering will happen and when the earthquake will occur we cannot tell ... It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years or more from now.<ref name=\"Yuri\"/>}}\n\nNevertheless, in the {{Age|2006|06|22}} years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area, and two major reports issued by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events. The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geller |first1=Robert J. |date=Dec 1997 |title=Earthquake prediction: a critical review |journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]] |volume=131 |issue=3 |pages=425\u2013450 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-246X.1997.tb06588.x |bibcode=1997GeoJI.131..425G}}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Geological Survey]] most recent forecast, known as [[UCERF3]] (Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3), released in November 2013, estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater (i.e. equal to or greater than the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide. The same report also estimated there is a 7% probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Long-Term Forecast for California |url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=4146 |website=[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]]}}{{failed verification|date=July 2019}}</ref> A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical, social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California.

Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years. The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time-correlated events. However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=Earthquakes Along The Cascadia And San Andreas Faults May Be Linked, Affecting Risk To San Francisco Bay Region |author=BSSA |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080403131923.htm |publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]] |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== Earthquakes ==\n{{See also|List of earthquakes in California}}\nThe San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times:\n\n* [[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake]]: About {{convert|350|km|mi|sp=us}} were ruptured in central and southern California.
