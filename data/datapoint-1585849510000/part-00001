Ellsworth traveled by horseback to the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Ohio]] to investigate family lands in the region. Ellsworth's father Oliver Ellsworth had purchased over {{convert|41000|acre|km2}} in the Western Reserve, including most of present-day [[Cleveland]], joining with other prominent Connecticut men snapping up over three million acres (12,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) sold by the state of Connecticut.<ref>The New Connecticut (Ohio) towns of Ellsworth and Windsor were named after the family and its Connecticut home.</ref> (Among the eight original purchasers was a family relation, merchant [[Thaddeus Leavitt]] of Suffield.) Ellsworth wrote a small, uneven book about his experiences entitled ''A Tour to New Connecticut in 1811''. Ellsworth's mission was straightening out irregularities in land sales by the family agent.\n\nIt was an arduous trip. Along the way Ellsworth made note of attractive vistas, rowdy drunks, solicitous innkeepers and his disappointment in places of which he had heard, like Erie. The journey's rigors were relieved by a meeting with his old friend Margaret Dwight, daughter of Yale president [[Timothy Dwight IV]], who was visiting family in present-day [[Warren, Ohio]]. \"Here too\", wrote Ellsworth, \"I met with my good old friend Margaret Dwight, we sat down and passed a few hours in social chat.\" Dwight wrote her own account of her Western Reserve trip, ''A Journey to Ohio in 1810''.<ref>Margaret Dwight's manuscript was edited by Max Farrand and published in 1912 as Volume I of the Yale Historical Manuscripts series.</ref>\n\nOver twenty years later, in 1832, Ellsworth traveled west again, this time as U.S. Commissioner of Indian Tribes in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]].<ref>Ellsworth wrote a book about this journey entitled ''Washington Irving on the Prairie: Or, A Narrative of a Tour of the Southwest in the Year 1832''.</ref> President [[Andrew Jackson]] appointed Ellsworth one of three commissioners to \"study the country, to mark the boundaries, to pacify the warring Indians and, in general to establish order and justice\" after Congress's passage of the 1830 [[Indian Removal Act]]. Ellsworth travelled to [[Fort Gibson]] to investigate the situation. (Some critics blame Ellsworth for being complicit in the subsequent removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to [[Indian Territory]], present-day Oklahoma, particularly since Ellsworth's appointment and subsequent western trip followed the Indian Removal Act, Andrew Jackson's first significant act as President. Other historians note Ellsworth's sympathetic outlook towards the tribes.)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tqzVNiFasC&pg=PA218&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+smith&lr=&ei=kib0SO64I4HEMpiywOsI&sig=ACfU3U0yM9Q5YlhTC0ngmGzJEpeMZtMhsg Fugitive Poses: Native American Indian Scenes of Absence and Presence, Gerald Robert Vizenor, University of Nebraska Press, 1998]</ref>\n[[Image:OliverEllsworthWindsorCT.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Oliver Ellsworth Homestead]], Windsor, Connecticut, birthplace of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, National Historic Landmark]]\nAlong the way, Ellsworth made stops in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], then traveled on to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he met with explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] and saw the recently captured Native American leader [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], chief of the [[Sauk and Fox]] tribe. Leavitt's mission was a complicated one: he was charged with trying to mediate between the conflicting claims of several Indian tribes, who were being forced into an ever-smaller area, in competition with newer immigrants and the interests of the [[Chouteau]] family, the powerful St. Louis magnates of the Midwestern fur trade.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyyuR36PNr4C&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+trail+of+tears&source=web&ots=v6drOD-jS2&sig=a8uQvAc2G3cS5yVmAE1h-CIWJkI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Aristocratic Encounters: European Travelers and North American Indians, Harry Liebersohn, Cambridge University Press, 1998]</ref>\n\nEllsworth was accompanied on the expedition by three companions: author [[Washington Irving]], who recorded his impressions in ''A Tour on the Prairies''; [[Charles La Trobe]], an [[Englishman]], [[mountaineer]] and [[travel writer]]  who later served in the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|British diplomatic corps]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Australia]]; and [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Count]] Albert Pourtales.<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v040/v040p355.pdf The Journal of the Union Mission, Hope Holway, [[University of Oklahoma]]]</ref>\n\nWashington Irving wrote of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, \"this worthy leader of our little band\": \"He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate simplicity and benevolence of heart. The greater part of his days had been passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and statesmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle and mingle among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=a04VAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22a+tour+on+the+prairies%22+washington+irving&ei=vObwSNHyCJqktAOL99Fy#PPA2,M1 A Tour on the Prairies, Washington Irving, Henry G.

His twin brother [[William W. Ellsworth]] was [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1838 to 1842, and served as a U.S. Congressman from Connecticut as well. William Wolcott Ellsworth was married to the daughter of [[Noah Webster]], the publisher of the eponymous dictionaries.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Patent Office, Ellsworth found one third of the floor-space in his office occupied by over 60 models of inventions; he moved them to a separate room. He also found that no list of patent applicants had ever been drawn up, a deficiency he soon corrected.\n[[File:500 Farmers Wanted.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Broadside (printing)|Broadside]] advertising sale by Ellsworth of parcels of his western lands, [[Lafayette, Indiana]], 1847]]\nActing as Patent Commissioner, Ellsworth made a decision that profoundly affected the future of Hartford and Connecticut. The young Samuel Colt was struggling to establish a firm to manufacture his new revolver. Ellsworth became interested in Colt's invention, and in 1836 made the decision to issue Colt U.S. Patent No. 138. On the basis of Ellsworth's decision, Colt was able to raise some $200,000 from investors to incorporate the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the forerunner of the mighty [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt arms]] manufacturing empire.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_4.shtml Gunmaker to the World, Ellsavorth S.

He became so interested, for instance, in a new-fangled invention by [[Samuel Morse]] called the telegraph that Ellsworth petitioned Congress for a $30,000 grant to test the possibilities of the technology.<ref>[http://patentmodelassociation.com/story.html The Story of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patentmodelassociation.com]</ref>\n\nFrom Ellsworth's exposure to the [[Western United States|West]] and knowledge of inventions, he prophesied late in life that the lands of the West would be cultivated by means of steam plows. This prophecy was introduced in the probate of his will in an attempt to prove that he was of unsound mind.\n\nEllsworth was proven correct, of course, and his interest in agriculture during his time as Patent Commissioner induced Congress in 1839 to appropriate the first monies for farming, which were used to collect seeds from foreign countries and distribute them through the United States post office, as Ellsworth had urged. By 1845 Ellsworth's patent office was performing the functions of a full-fledged agricultural bureau. For this accomplishment Ellsworth earned the sobriquet \"Father of the United States Department of Agriculture.\"\n\nA comment by Ellsworth about the increased workload at the patent office, taken out of context and embellished, was apparently the source of an [[urban legend]] that a patent office official ([[Charles H. Duell]] in some versions) claimed that everything which could be invented had already been invented.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_27/ai_100755224 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903213912/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_27/ai_100755224 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2004-09-03 | title=A Patently False Patent Myth still | journal=Skeptical Inquirer | date=May\u2013June 2003 | author=Samuel Sass | format= &ndash; <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AA+Patently+False+Patent+Myth+still&as_publication=Skeptical+Inquirer&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref> In his 1843 report to Congress, Ellsworth stated: \"The advancement of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human improvement must end.\" The report then lists a record number of patents, implying his comment was intended to be humorous.<ref>Samuel Sass, \"A Patently False Patent Myth\", ''The Skeptical Inquirer'', Spring 1989, vol. 13, pp. 3110-313.</ref>\n\nFollowing Ellsworth's stint in the Patent Office, he settled in Lafayette, Indiana, acting as an agent for purchase and settlement of public land, but in 1857 he returned to Connecticut. Ellsworth later served as an early president of the Aetna Insurance Company. He was an early benefactor of [[Yale College]], donating some $700,000 to his alma mater, as well as title to the Ellsworth lands in the former [[Western Reserve]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PfYLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA295&lpg=PA295&dq=aetna+%22henry+l.+ellsworth%22&source=web&ots=SZzDlbYW3z&sig=bmAexlF3MqsctDaDcyd5JxHNQBo&hl=en The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly, William Farrand Felch, Vol. I, January, 1895, Hartford]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Morse Telegraph 1837.jpg|thumb|left|The Morse Telegraph, one of many inventions championed by Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]\n\nEllsworth died, aged 67, on December 27, 1858 in [[Fair Haven (New Haven)|Fair Haven, Connecticut]]. Following his death, Ellsworth's papers were discovered among the family papers of the Goodrich family. Ellsworth was a Yale classmate of [[Chauncey Allen Goodrich]],<ref>Chauncey Allen Goodrich was also the brother-in-law of William Wolcott Ellsworth, Henry Leavitt's brother. Goodrich and Ellsworth had both married daughters of dictionary publisher Noah Webster.</ref> whose sister Nancy Henry Leavitt Ellsworth married.

The former patent commissioner's papers  today make up the Henry Leavitt Ellsworth Papers at Yale's Sterling Library.\nAnnie Goodrich Ellsworth, only daughter of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, married the publisher Roswell Smith, who with his partner [[Josiah Gilbert Holland]] founded, in partnership with the publishing house [[Charles Scribner I|Charles Scribner & Co.]], ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's Monthly]]'' and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'' magazines.<ref>Oliver Ellsworth, the son of William W.

The journey's rigors were relieved by a meeting with his old friend Margaret Dwight, daughter of Yale president [[Timothy Dwight IV]], who was visiting family in present-day [[Warren, Ohio]]. \"Here too\", wrote Ellsworth, \"I met with my good old friend Margaret Dwight, we sat down and passed a few hours in social chat.\" Dwight wrote her own account of her Western Reserve trip, ''A Journey to Ohio in 1810''.<ref>Margaret Dwight's manuscript was edited by Max Farrand and published in 1912 as Volume I of the Yale Historical Manuscripts series.</ref>\n\nOver twenty years later, in 1832, Ellsworth traveled west again, this time as U.S. Commissioner of Indian Tribes in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]].<ref>Ellsworth wrote a book about this journey entitled ''Washington Irving on the Prairie: Or, A Narrative of a Tour of the Southwest in the Year 1832''.</ref> President [[Andrew Jackson]] appointed Ellsworth one of three commissioners to \"study the country, to mark the boundaries, to pacify the warring Indians and, in general to establish order and justice\" after Congress's passage of the 1830 [[Indian Removal Act]]. Ellsworth travelled to [[Fort Gibson]] to investigate the situation. (Some critics blame Ellsworth for being complicit in the subsequent removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to [[Indian Territory]], present-day Oklahoma, particularly since Ellsworth's appointment and subsequent western trip followed the Indian Removal Act, Andrew Jackson's first significant act as President. Other historians note Ellsworth's sympathetic outlook towards the tribes.)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tqzVNiFasC&pg=PA218&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+smith&lr=&ei=kib0SO64I4HEMpiywOsI&sig=ACfU3U0yM9Q5YlhTC0ngmGzJEpeMZtMhsg Fugitive Poses: Native American Indian Scenes of Absence and Presence, Gerald Robert Vizenor, University of Nebraska Press, 1998]</ref>\n[[Image:OliverEllsworthWindsorCT.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Oliver Ellsworth Homestead]], Windsor, Connecticut, birthplace of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, National Historic Landmark]]\nAlong the way, Ellsworth made stops in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], then traveled on to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he met with explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] and saw the recently captured Native American leader [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], chief of the [[Sauk and Fox]] tribe. Leavitt's mission was a complicated one: he was charged with trying to mediate between the conflicting claims of several Indian tribes, who were being forced into an ever-smaller area, in competition with newer immigrants and the interests of the [[Chouteau]] family, the powerful St. Louis magnates of the Midwestern fur trade.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyyuR36PNr4C&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+trail+of+tears&source=web&ots=v6drOD-jS2&sig=a8uQvAc2G3cS5yVmAE1h-CIWJkI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Aristocratic Encounters: European Travelers and North American Indians, Harry Liebersohn, Cambridge University Press, 1998]</ref>\n\nEllsworth was accompanied on the expedition by three companions: author [[Washington Irving]], who recorded his impressions in ''A Tour on the Prairies''; [[Charles La Trobe]], an [[Englishman]], [[mountaineer]] and [[travel writer]]  who later served in the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|British diplomatic corps]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Australia]]; and [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Count]] Albert Pourtales.<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v040/v040p355.pdf The Journal of the Union Mission, Hope Holway, [[University of Oklahoma]]]</ref>\n\nWashington Irving wrote of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, \"this worthy leader of our little band\": \"He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate simplicity and benevolence of heart. The greater part of his days had been passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and statesmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle and mingle among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=a04VAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22a+tour+on+the+prairies%22+washington+irving&ei=vObwSNHyCJqktAOL99Fy#PPA2,M1 A Tour on the Prairies, Washington Irving, Henry G. Bohn, London, 1850]</ref>\n\n==Patent Office==\nIn 1835, Ellsworth was elected mayor of Hartford, Connecticut, but had served only a month when he was appointed the first Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office, an office he held for ten years, from 1835 until 1845. His twin brother [[William W. Ellsworth]] was [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1838 to 1842, and served as a U.S. Congressman from Connecticut as well. William Wolcott Ellsworth was married to the daughter of [[Noah Webster]], the publisher of the eponymous dictionaries.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Patent Office, Ellsworth found one third of the floor-space in his office occupied by over 60 models of inventions; he moved them to a separate room. He also found that no list of patent applicants had ever been drawn up, a deficiency he soon corrected.\n[[File:500 Farmers Wanted.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Broadside (printing)|Broadside]] advertising sale by Ellsworth of parcels of his western lands, [[Lafayette, Indiana]], 1847]]\nActing as Patent Commissioner, Ellsworth made a decision that profoundly affected the future of Hartford and Connecticut. The young Samuel Colt was struggling to establish a firm to manufacture his new revolver. Ellsworth became interested in Colt's invention, and in 1836 made the decision to issue Colt U.S. Patent No. 138. On the basis of Ellsworth's decision, Colt was able to raise some $200,000 from investors to incorporate the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the forerunner of the mighty [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt arms]] manufacturing empire.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_4.shtml Gunmaker to the World, Ellsavorth S.

He became so interested, for instance, in a new-fangled invention by [[Samuel Morse]] called the telegraph that Ellsworth petitioned Congress for a $30,000 grant to test the possibilities of the technology.<ref>[http://patentmodelassociation.com/story.html The Story of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patentmodelassociation.com]</ref>\n\nFrom Ellsworth's exposure to the [[Western United States|West]] and knowledge of inventions, he prophesied late in life that the lands of the West would be cultivated by means of steam plows. This prophecy was introduced in the probate of his will in an attempt to prove that he was of unsound mind.\n\nEllsworth was proven correct, of course, and his interest in agriculture during his time as Patent Commissioner induced Congress in 1839 to appropriate the first monies for farming, which were used to collect seeds from foreign countries and distribute them through the United States post office, as Ellsworth had urged. By 1845 Ellsworth's patent office was performing the functions of a full-fledged agricultural bureau. For this accomplishment Ellsworth earned the sobriquet \"Father of the United States Department of Agriculture.\"\n\nA comment by Ellsworth about the increased workload at the patent office, taken out of context and embellished, was apparently the source of an [[urban legend]] that a patent office official ([[Charles H. Duell]] in some versions) claimed that everything which could be invented had already been invented.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_27/ai_100755224 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903213912/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_27/ai_100755224 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2004-09-03 | title=A Patently False Patent Myth still | journal=Skeptical Inquirer | date=May\u2013June 2003 | author=Samuel Sass | format= &ndash; <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AA+Patently+False+Patent+Myth+still&as_publication=Skeptical+Inquirer&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref> In his 1843 report to Congress, Ellsworth stated: \"The advancement of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human improvement must end.\" The report then lists a record number of patents, implying his comment was intended to be humorous.<ref>Samuel Sass, \"A Patently False Patent Myth\", ''The Skeptical Inquirer'', Spring 1989, vol. 13, pp. 3110-313.</ref>\n\nFollowing Ellsworth's stint in the Patent Office, he settled in Lafayette, Indiana, acting as an agent for purchase and settlement of public land, but in 1857 he returned to Connecticut. Ellsworth later served as an early president of the Aetna Insurance Company. He was an early benefactor of [[Yale College]], donating some $700,000 to his alma mater, as well as title to the Ellsworth lands in the former [[Western Reserve]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PfYLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA295&lpg=PA295&dq=aetna+%22henry+l.+ellsworth%22&source=web&ots=SZzDlbYW3z&sig=bmAexlF3MqsctDaDcyd5JxHNQBo&hl=en The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly, William Farrand Felch, Vol. I, January, 1895, Hartford]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Morse Telegraph 1837.jpg|thumb|left|The Morse Telegraph, one of many inventions championed by Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]\n\nEllsworth died, aged 67, on December 27, 1858 in [[Fair Haven (New Haven)|Fair Haven, Connecticut]]. Following his death, Ellsworth's papers were discovered among the family papers of the Goodrich family. Ellsworth was a Yale classmate of [[Chauncey Allen Goodrich]],<ref>Chauncey Allen Goodrich was also the brother-in-law of William Wolcott Ellsworth, Henry Leavitt's brother. Goodrich and Ellsworth had both married daughters of dictionary publisher Noah Webster.</ref> whose sister Nancy Henry Leavitt Ellsworth married. The journal of Ellsworth's first trip to New Connecticut came to the [[Yale University Library]] as part of the Goodrich Family Collection. The former patent commissioner's papers  today make up the Henry Leavitt Ellsworth Papers at Yale's Sterling Library.\nAnnie Goodrich Ellsworth, only daughter of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, married the publisher Roswell Smith, who with his partner [[Josiah Gilbert Holland]] founded, in partnership with the publishing house [[Charles Scribner I|Charles Scribner & Co.]], ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's Monthly]]'' and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'' magazines.<ref>Oliver Ellsworth, the son of William W. Ellsworth, twin brother of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, married Caroline Cleveland Smith, whose first cousin was Roswell Smith, who married Anna G. Leavitt, Oliver's first cousin.  Oliver Ellsworth's son William Webster Ellsworth went into the Century Company publishing business with Roswell Smith, where he helped publish the Century Dictionary.[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIRCsrMwhroC&pg=PA16&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+smith&ei=wiH0SJTuEZeUM5mRjNgI&sig=ACfU3U1CIcUGIWtklRbYPIgIXwyMLeWzVA]</ref> Later Smith founded the publishing house [[The Century Company]], and assumed sole ownership of both magazines. He changed the name of  ''Scribner's Monthly'' to ''The Century''. His wife, the former Anna G. Ellsworth, dictated the inaugural message on Samuel F. B.
