In January 1970, she had the lead guest-starring female role as Princess Francesca in the only three-episode mission of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]''. In 1973, Baker co-starred in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Here We Go Again (TV series)|Here We Go Again]]''. The series was canceled after one season. In 1976, she played the frequently drunken daughter of the title character of the ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"Last Salute to the Commodore\", which departed from the usual show format whereby the viewer knows very early who the murderer is.\n\nIn the decades after ''Mirage'', she appeared frequently on television and began producing films, including the drama film ''[[Never Never Land (film)|Never Never Land]]'' (1980) and the [[miniseries]] ''[[A Woman of Substance (miniseries)|A Woman of Substance]]'' (1984), in which she played Laura. She reemerged on the big screen in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) as Senator Ruth Martin (\"Love your suit,\" [[Hannibal Lecter]] memorably said to her). Baker also appeared in the films ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'' and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]''. She guest-starred in four episodes of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' in 2005, 2008 and twice in 2012 as Blythe House, the mother of the title character.\n\nBaker spent more than a decade teaching acting at the [[Academy of Art University]], the nation's largest accredited private art and design school, in San Francisco. She was formerly the Executive Director of the School of Motion Pictures-Television and the School of Acting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Extraordinary-adventure-lures-ex-ingenue-2730297.php|first=Ruthe|last=Stein|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 27, 2004|title='Extraordinary adventure' lures ex-ingenue}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1= |first1= |title=Academy of Art University School of Acting \u2013 Faculty|url=http://www.academyart.edu/academics/acting/faculty|publisher=[[Academy of Art University]]|accessdate=2 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221173349/http://www.academyart.edu/academics/acting/faculty|archive-date=December 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Selected TV and filmography ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=4|1959\n| ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''\n| [[Margot Frank]]\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''\n| Jenny Lindenbrook\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Best of Everything (film)|The Best of Everything]]''\n| April Morrison\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Playhouse 90]]''\n| Shelia Cass\n| Episode: \"In Lonely Expectation\"\n|-\n| rowspan=3|1960\n| ''[[DuPont Show of the Month|The DuPont Show of the Month]]''\n| Nurse Leora Tozer\n| Episode: \"Arrowsmith\"\n|-\n| ''[[The Wizard of Baghdad]]''\n| Princess Yasmin\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Tess of the Storm Country (1960 film)|Tess of the Storm Country]]''\n| Tess MacLean\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=2|1961\n| ''[[Follow the Sun (TV series)|Follow the Sun]]''\n| Helen Henderson\n| Episode: \"Journey Into Darkness\"\n|-\n| ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]''\n| Veronica Sanders\n| Episode: \"Vendetta\"\n|-\n| rowspan=2|1962\n| ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]''\n| Carolyn\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The 300 Spartans]]''\n| Ellas\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=7|1963\n| ''[[The Nurses (CBS TV series)|The Doctors and the Nurses]]''\n| Marjorie Ford\n| Episode: \"Field of Battle\"\n|-\n| ''[[Nine Hours to Rama]]''\n| Sheila\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]''\n| Emily Stratman\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Stolen Hours]]''\n| Ellen\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Mr. Novak]]''\n| Mrs. Chase\n| Episode: \"A Feeling for Friday\"\n|-\n| ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''\n| Elisa\n| Episode: \"The Cruelest Sea of All\"\n|-\n| ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''\n| Marie Duplessis\n| Episode: \"Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are!\"\n|-\n| rowspan=5|1964\n| ''[[Strait-Jacket]]''\n| Carol Harbin\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]''\n| Lil Mainwaring\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Della (film)|Della]]''\n| Jenny Chappell\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Wagon Train]]''\n| Alice Whitetree\n| Episode: \"The Alice Whitetree Story\"\n|-\n| ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]''\n| Vivia Mandour\n| Television movie\n|-\n| rowspan=3|1965\n| ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]''\n| Shela\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Inherit the Wind (1965 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''\n| Rachel Brown\n| Television movie\n|-\n| ''[[The Big Valley]]''\n| Hester\n| Episode: \"By Fires Unseen\"\n|-\n| rowspan=4|1966\n| ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''\n| Linda Valence\n| Episode: \"Linda\"\n|-\n| ''Sands of Beersheba''\n| Susan\n| Alternative title: ''Thunder Over Israel''\n|-\n| ''[[Hawk (TV series)|Hawk]]''\n| Mary Wheelis\n| Episode: \"The Longleat Chronicles\"\n|-\n| ''The Dangerous Days of Kiowa Jones''\n| Amilia Rathmore\n| Television movie\n|-\n| rowspan=3|1967\n| ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''\n| Jean Carlisle\n| Episodes: \"The Judgement\" (Parts 1 & 2)\n|-\n| ''[[The Invaders]]''\n| Kathy Adams\n| Episode: \"Beachhead\"\n|-\n| ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]''\n| Laney\n| Episode: \"Free of Charge\"\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''\n| Suzie \"S.J.\" Clemens\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=5|1969\n| ''[[Krakatoa, East of Java]]''\n| Laura Travis\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Trial Run (1969 film)|Trial Run]]''\n| Carole Trenet\n| Television movie\n|-\n| ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''\n| Julie Oakes\n| Episode: \"A Love to Remember\"\n|-\n| ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]''\n| Elaine Brennan\n| Episode: \"Give Till It Hurts\"\n|-\n| ''[[The D.A.
