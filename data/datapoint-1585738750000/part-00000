He devised [[Le Chatelier's principle]], used by chemists and chemical engineers to predict the effect a changing condition has on a system in [[chemical equilibrium]]. He has also been credited with inventing [[French kissing]], although this has been discredited\n\n==Early life==\nLe Chatelier was born on 8 October 1850 in Paris and was the son of French materials engineer [[Louis Le Chatelier]] and Louise Durand. His father was an influential figure who played important roles in the birth of the French [[aluminium]] industry, the introduction of the [[Martin-Siemens process]]es into the iron and steel industries, and the rise of railway transportation. Le Chatelier's father profoundly influenced his son's future. Henry Louis had one sister, Marie, and four brothers, Louis (1853\u20131928), [[Alfred Le Chatelier|Alfred (1855\u20131929)]], George (1857\u20131935), and Andr\u00e9 (1861\u20131929). His mother raised the children by regimen, described by Henry Louis: \"I was accustomed to a very strict discipline: it was necessary to wake up on time, to prepare for your duties and lessons, to eat everything on your plate, etc. All my life I maintained respect for order and law. Order is one of the most perfect forms of civilization.\"<ref>L. Guillet, ''R\u00e9vue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', special edition, January 1937</ref>\n\nAs a child, Le Chatelier attended the [[Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]] in Paris. At the age of 19, after only one year of instruction in specialized engineering, he followed in his father's footsteps by enrolling in the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] on 25 October 1869. Like all the pupils of the Polytechnique, in September 1870, Le Chatelier was named second lieutenant and later took part in the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|Siege of Paris]]. After brilliant successes in his technical schooling, he entered the [[\u00c9cole des Mines]] in Paris in 1871.\n\nLe Chatelier married Genevi\u00e8ve Nicolas, a friend of the family and sister of four fellow students of the Polytechnique. They had seven children, four girls and three boys, five of whom entered scientific fields; two died preceding Le Chatelier's death.\n\n==Career==\nDespite training as an engineer, and even with his interests in industrial problems, Le Chatelier chose to teach chemistry rather than pursue a career in industry. In 1887, he was appointed head of the general chemistry to the preparatory course of the \u00c9cole des Mines in Paris. He tried unsuccessfully to get a position teaching chemistry at the \u00c9cole polytechnique in 1884 and again in 1897.\n\nAt the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Le Chatelier succeeded [[Paul Sch\u00fctzenberger|Sch\u00fctzenberger]] as chair of inorganic chemistry. Later he taught at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] university, where he replaced [[Henri Moissan]].\n\nAt the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Le Chatelier taught: \n:*Phenomena of combustion (1898)\n:*Theory of chemical equilibria, high temperature measurements and phenomena of dissociation (1898\u20131899)\n:*Properties of metal alloys (1899\u20131900)\n:*Iron alloys (1900\u20131901)\n:*General methods of analytical chemistry (1901\u20131902)\n:*General laws of analytical chemistry (1901\u20131902)\n:*General laws of chemical mechanics (1903)\n:*Silica and its compounds (1905\u20131906)\n:*Some practical applications of the fundamental principles of chemistry (1906\u20131907)\n:*Properties of metals and some alloys (1907)\n\nAfter four unsuccessful campaigns (1884, 1897, 1898 and 1900), Le Chatelier was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences (Academy of Science) in 1907. He was also elected to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1907. In 1924, he became an Honorary Member of the [[Polish Chemical Society]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ptchem.pl/pl/honors/president-of-honor-and-honorary-members-of-ptchem |title=President of honour and honorary members of PTChem |access-date=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific work==\nIn chemistry, Le Chatelier is best known for his work on his principle of chemical equilibrium, [[Le Chatelier's principle]], and on varying solubility of salts in an ideal solution. He published no fewer than thirty papers on these topics between 1884 and 1914. His results on chemical equilibrium were presented in 1884 at the [[French Academy of Sciences|Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]] in Paris.\n\nLe Chatelier also carried out extensive research on metallurgy and was one of the founders of the technical newspaper ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'' (Metallurgy Review).\n\nPart of Le Chatelier's work was devoted to industry. For example, he was a consulting engineer for a cement company, the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des chaux et ciments Pavin de Lafarge'', today known as [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] Cement. His 1887 doctoral thesis was dedicated to the subject of mortars: ''Recherches exp\u00e9rimentales sur la constitution des mortiers hydrauliques'' (Experimental Research on the Composition of Hydraulic Mortars).\n\nLe Chatelier in 1901 attempted the direct combination of the two gases nitrogen and hydrogen at a pressure of 200 atm and 600&nbsp;\u00b0C in the presence of metallic iron. An air compressor forced the mixture of gases into a steel Berthelot bomb, where a platinum spiral heated them and the reduced iron catalyst.<ref>4. \"Henri Le Chatelier: His Publications,\" Ceram. Abs., 16, (Oct., 1937)</ref> A terrific explosion occurred which nearly killed an assistant. Le Chatelier found that the explosion was due to the presence of air in the apparatus used. And thus it was left for Haber to succeed where several noted French chemists, including Thenard, Sainte Claire Deville and even Berthelot had failed. Less than five years later, Haber and Claude were successful in producing ammonia on a commercial scale, acknowledging that the account of Le Chatelier's failed attempt had accelerated their research. Near the end of his life, Le Chatelier wrote, \"I let the discovery of the ammonia synthesis slip through my hands. It was the greatest blunder of my scientific career\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ed015p289.3|title = Le Chatelier and the synthesis of ammonia| journal=Journal of Chemical Education| volume=15| issue=6| pages=289|year = 1938|last1 = Silverman|first1 = Alexander}}</ref>\n\n===Le Chatelier's principle===\n{{main|Le Chatelier's principle}}\nLe Chatelier's Principle states that a system always acts to oppose changes in [[chemical equilibrium]]; to restore equilibrium, the system will favor a chemical pathway to reduce or eliminate the disturbance so as to restabilize at thermodynamic equilibrium. Put another way,\n\n<blockquote>''If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in [[concentration (chemistry)|concentration]], [[temperature]] or total [[pressure]], the equilibrium will shift in order to minimize that change.''</blockquote>\n\nThis qualitative law enables one to envision the displacement of equilibrium of a chemical reaction.\n\nFor example: a change in concentration of a reaction in equilibrium for the following equation:\n\n:[[nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]]([[gas|g]]) + 3[[hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]](g) \u21cc 2[[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]](g)\n\nIf one increases the pressure of the reactants, the reaction will tend to move towards the products to decrease the pressure of the reaction.\n\nHowever consider another example: in the [[contact process]] for the production of [[sulfuric acid]], the second stage is a reversible reaction:\n\n:2[[sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]](g) + [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]](g) \u21cc 2[[sulfur trioxide|SO<sub>3</sub>]](g)\n\nThe forward reaction is exothermic and the reverse reaction is endothermic. Viewed by Le Chatelier's principle a larger amount of thermal energy in the system would favor the endothermic reverse reaction, as this would absorb the increased energy; in other words the equilibrium would shift to the reactants in order to remove the stress of added heat. For similar reasons, lower temperatures would favor the exothermic forward reaction, and produce more products. This works in this case, since due to loss of entropy the reaction becomes less exothermic as temperature increases; however reactions that become more exothermic as temperature increases would seem to violate this principle.\n\n==His time in politics==\nIt was typical for scientists and engineers of the time to have a very scientific vision of the industry. In the first issue of ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', Le Chatelier published an article describing his convictions on the subject,<ref>H.L. Le Chatelier, \"Role of Science in Industry\" in ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', n\u00b01, 1904 page 1 to 10</ref> discussing the [[scientific management]] theory of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. In 1928, he published a book on [[Taylorism]].\n\nLe Chatelier was politically conservative. In 1934, he published an opinion on the French forty-hour work week law in the Brussels publication ''Revue \u00e9conomique internationale''. However, in spite of certain anti-parliamentarian convictions, he kept away from any extremist or radical movements.\n\nHis brother [[Alfred Le Chatelier]], a former soldier, opened the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny ([[Le Chesnay]]), near Versailles in 1897. The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware. In 1901 the critic [[Henri Cazalis]] (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of [[Art Nouveau]] ceramics.{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=110}} Henry Louis Le Chatelier seems to have encouraged Alfred's workshop and assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and also designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=112}}\n\n===Decorations===\nLe Chatelier was named \"chevalier\" (knight) of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 1887, became \"officier\" (officer) in 1908, \"commandeur\" (Knight Commander) in 1919, and was finally awarded the title of \"grand officier\" (Knight Grand Officer) in May 1927.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Cours de chimie industrielle'' (1896; second edition, 1902)\n* ''High Temperature Measurements'', translated by [[George Kimball Burgess|G.
