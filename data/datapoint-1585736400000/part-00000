Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\">Gregory, James N.

In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of [[sharecropping]] that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless black farmers to be forced off of the land.<ref>Gordon Marshall, \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-sharecro.html Sharecropping],\" ''Encyclopedia.com'', 1998.</ref>\n\nAs a result, approximately 1.4 million black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\">Gregory, James N.

The other four states showed net increases in their African American populations in 1950 compared to 1920, with the percentage decreasing due to the white population increasing more.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" /> Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], followed in order by [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The Second great black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the [[Western United States|Western states]]. Western cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] attracted African Americans in large numbers.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" />\n\nThere were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in [[Chicago]], while those from Virginia tended to move to [[Philadelphia]]. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography, with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana). When multiple destinations were equidistant, [[chain migration]] played a larger role, with migrants following the path set by those before them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Migration: The African American Exodus from The South|first=Dan |last=Kopf|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-great-migration-the-african-american-exodus/|website = Priceonomics|date=January 28, 2016|access-date = 2016-02-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics, tensions and employment sectors ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\nWhen the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was signed in 1863, less than eight percent of the African-American population lived in the Northeastern or Midwestern United States.<ref name=Migrations>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html|title=Migrations \u2013 The African-American Mosaic Exhibition \u2013 Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|first=United States Bureau of the|last=Census|date=23 July 2010|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> This began to change over the next decade; by 1880, a migration was underway to Kansas.

There was no government assistance, but often northern industries, such as the [[railroad]]s, meatpacking, and stockyards, sometimes paid for transportation and relocation.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about forty percent in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[History of the African Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[New York City]] had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of blacks were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and blacks.\n\n=== Tensions and violence ===\nIn the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the [[Red Summer]]. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between blacks and whites in major United States cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Albert S.|date=Spring 2011|title=New Perspectives on Lynching, Race Riots, and Mob Violence|url=|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=30|issue=3|pages=71\u201375|via=EBSCO|doi=10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.3.0071}}</ref> The reasons for this violence vary.

As the war ended in 1918, many men returned home to find out their jobs had been taken by black men who were willing to work for far less.<ref name=\":02\" /> By the time the rioting and violence had subsided in Chicago, 38 people had lost their lives, with 500 more injured.

In the south, Blacks were harshly treated, and were not expected to be anything other than a slave. This theory created by society allowed for Blacks to move full force into the movement.

Many [[blues]] singers migrated from the [[Mississippi Delta]] to Chicago to escape racial discrimination. [[Muddy Waters]], [[Chester Burnett]], and [[Buddy Guy]] are among the most well-known blues artists who migrated to Chicago. Great Delta-born pianist [[Eddie Boyd]] told ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, \"I thought of coming to Chicago where I could get away from some of that racism and where I would have an opportunity to, well, do something with my talent....

In a number of states, there were decades of black population decline, especially across the Deep South \"black belt\" where cotton had been king. The migration changed the demographics of the South. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40 percent in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30 percent of the state's total. \"The disappearance of the 'black belt' was one of the striking effects\" of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.<ref name=\"Gregory18\">Gregory (2005), p. 18.</ref>\n\nIn Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970,<ref name=PopRace>Gibson, Campbell and Kay Jung (September 2002).

In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8 percent of the nation's total black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47 percent of the nation's total.<ref name=\"Gregory18\" />\n\nBecause the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of black culture and politics by mid-century. Informal residential segregation and the tendency of people to settle with others of their home communities led to concentrations of blacks in certain areas. The northern \"Black metropolises\" developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of black culture.\n\nAs a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/site/assets/2014/10/03-1024x681.jpg James Gilbertlove, \"African Americans and the American Labor Movement\"], ''Prologue'', Summer 1997, Vol. 29.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the African-American population of [[Detroit]] was 6,000.

For example, many people from [[Mississippi]] moved directly north by train to Chicago, from [[Alabama]] to Cleveland and Detroit, from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to [[New York City]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Philadelphia]], and in the second migration, from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Denver]], and [[Seattle]].\n\n=== Discrimination and working conditions ===\n[[File:Bronxhub1.jpeg|thumb|[[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], New York City.<ref>[http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/abrieflookatbronx.html A Brief Look at The Bronx], Bronx Historical Society.

Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban white working class (often recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfrican Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries. Between 1910 and 1920, the number of blacks employed in industry nearly doubled from 500,000 to 901,000.<ref name=\"archives.gov\" /> After the [[Great Depression]], more advances took place after workers in the steel and meatpacking industries organized into [[labor union]]s in the 1930s and 1940s, under the interracial [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). The unions ended the segregation of many jobs, and African Americans began to advance into more skilled jobs and supervisory positions previously informally reserved for whites.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1960, the number of blacks in managerial and administrative occupations doubled, along with the number of blacks in white-collar occupations, while the number of black agricultural workers in 1960 fell to one-fourth of what it was in 1940.<ref>{{citation|last=Miller|first=Aurelia Toyer|title=The Social and Economic Status of the Black Population in the U.S.: An Historical View, 1790\u20131978|journal=[[The Review of Black Political Economy]]|volume=10|issue=3|year=1980|pages=314\u2013318|doi=10.1007/bf02689658}}</ref> Also, between 1936 and 1959, black income relative to white income more than doubled in various skilled trades.<ref>{{citation|last=Ashenfelter|first=Orley|author-link=Orley Ashenfelter|title=Changes in Labor Market Discrimination Over Time|journal=[[The Journal of Human Resources]]|volume=5|issue=4|pages=403\u2013430|year=1970|doi=10.2307/144999|jstor=144999}}</ref> Encountering very little [[employment discrimination]], blacks had higher [[Unemployment#Labor force participation rate|labor force participation rates]] than whites in every [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] from 1890 to 1950.<ref>{{citation|title=Historical Statistics of the United States: From Colonial Times to 1957|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], [[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/1208?start_page=83|year=1960|place=Washington, D.C.|page=72}}</ref> As a result of these advancements, the percentage of black families living below the poverty line declined from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960 and to 30 percent by 1970.<ref>{{citation|last1=Thernstrom|first1=Stephan|last2=Thernstrom|first2=Abigail|author-link1=Stephan Thernstrom|author-link2=Abigail Thernstrom|title=America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible|place=New York|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=1997|page=232}}</ref>\n\nPopulations increased so rapidly among both African-American migrants and new European immigrants that there were housing shortages in most major cities. With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. [[Mortgage discrimination]] and [[redlining]] in [[inner city]] areas limited the newer African-American migrants' ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price. In the long term, the [[National Housing Act of 1934]] contributed to limiting the availability of loans to urban areas, particularly those areas inhabited by African Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Kevin Fox |last=Gotham |title=Racialization and the State: The Housing Act of 1934 and the Creation of the Federal Housing Administration |journal=Sociological Perspectives |volume=43 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=291\u2013317 |jstor=1389798 |doi=10.2307/1389798 }}</ref>\n\nMigrants going to [[Albany, New York]] found poor living conditions and employment opportunities, but also higher wages and better schools and social services.

The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\n=== Integration and segregation ===\n[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|Sojourner Truth]] housing project in [[Detroit]] erected this sign, 1942]]\nIn cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society. As they lived and worked more closely with European Americans, the divide became increasingly indefinite. This period marked the transition for many African Americans from lifestyles as rural farmers to urban industrial workers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black exodus : the great migration from the American South|date=1991|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|others=Harrison, Alferdteen.|isbn=9781604738216|location=Jackson|oclc=775352334}}</ref>\n\nThis migration gave birth to a cultural boom in cities such as Chicago and New York. In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the \"Black Metropolis\". From 1924 to 1929, the \"Black Metropolis\" was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community's entrepreneurs were black during this period. \"The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trcwabash.org/history.html|title=History|website=The Renaissance Collaborative}}</ref> The \"Black Belt\" geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one's level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.<ref>Poe, Tracy N.

With the defense buildup for [[World War II]] and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of blacks leaving the South through the 1960s. After the political and civil gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in the 1970s migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as blacks traveled to new regions of the South for economic opportunity.\n\n== White southern reaction ==\nThe beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although blacks were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: \"Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.\"<ref name=Reich>Reich, Steven A.: ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic''</ref>\n\nWhen the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern blacks in order to induce them to stay.\n\nAs a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of [[black nationalism]], co-operated in attempting to coerce blacks to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it. The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for blacks, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, \"work or fight\" laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize blacks into staying.<ref name=Reich /><ref name=anderson>Anderson, Talmadge and Stewart, James Benjamin: ''Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications''</ref> These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]] as interfering with \"the natural right of workers to move from place to place at their own discretion\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=White rage : the unspoken truth of our racial

southerners were less concerned, as mechanization of agriculture in the late 1930s had resulted in another labor surplus so southern planters put up less resistance.<ref name=Reich />\n\n== In popular

Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\">Gregory, James N.

In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of [[sharecropping]] that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless black farmers to be forced off of the land.<ref>Gordon Marshall, \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-sharecro.html Sharecropping],\" ''Encyclopedia.com'', 1998.</ref>\n\nAs a result, approximately 1.4 million black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\">Gregory, James N.

The other four states showed net increases in their African American populations in 1950 compared to 1920, with the percentage decreasing due to the white population increasing more.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" /> Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], followed in order by [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The Second great black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the [[Western United States|Western states]]. Western cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] attracted African Americans in large numbers.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" />\n\nThere were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in [[Chicago]], while those from Virginia tended to move to [[Philadelphia]]. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography, with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana). When multiple destinations were equidistant, [[chain migration]] played a larger role, with migrants following the path set by those before them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Migration: The African American Exodus from The South|first=Dan |last=Kopf|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-great-migration-the-african-american-exodus/|website = Priceonomics|date=January 28, 2016|access-date = 2016-02-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics, tensions and employment sectors ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\nWhen the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was signed in 1863, less than eight percent of the African-American population lived in the Northeastern or Midwestern United States.<ref name=Migrations>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html|title=Migrations \u2013 The African-American Mosaic Exhibition \u2013 Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|first=United States Bureau of the|last=Census|date=23 July 2010|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> This began to change over the next decade; by 1880, a migration was underway to Kansas.

There was no government assistance, but often northern industries, such as the [[railroad]]s, meatpacking, and stockyards, sometimes paid for transportation and relocation.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about forty percent in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[History of the African Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[New York City]] had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of blacks were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and blacks.\n\n=== Tensions and violence ===\nIn the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the [[Red Summer]]. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between blacks and whites in major United States cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Albert S.|date=Spring 2011|title=New Perspectives on Lynching, Race Riots, and Mob Violence|url=|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=30|issue=3|pages=71\u201375|via=EBSCO|doi=10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.3.0071}}</ref> The reasons for this violence vary.

Principally, many blacks were assuming the jobs of white men who went to go fight in World War I. As the war ended in 1918, many men returned home to find out their jobs had been taken by black men who were willing to work for far less.<ref name=\":02\" /> By the time the rioting and violence had subsided in Chicago, 38 people had lost their lives, with 500 more injured.

In a number of states, there were decades of black population decline, especially across the Deep South \"black belt\" where cotton had been king. The migration changed the demographics of the South. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40 percent in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30 percent of the state's total. \"The disappearance of the 'black belt' was one of the striking effects\" of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.<ref name=\"Gregory18\">Gregory (2005), p. 18.</ref>\n\nIn Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970,<ref name=PopRace>Gibson, Campbell and Kay Jung (September 2002).

In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8 percent of the nation's total black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47 percent of the nation's total.<ref name=\"Gregory18\" />\n\nBecause the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of black culture and politics by mid-century. Informal residential segregation and the tendency of people to settle with others of their home communities led to concentrations of blacks in certain areas. The northern \"Black metropolises\" developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of black culture.\n\nAs a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/site/assets/2014/10/03-1024x681.jpg James Gilbertlove, \"African Americans and the American Labor Movement\"], ''Prologue'', Summer 1997, Vol. 29.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the African-American population of [[Detroit]] was 6,000.

By the 1920s, New York's [[Harlem]] became a center of black cultural life, influenced by the American migrants as well as new immigrants from the [[Caribbean]] area.\n\nSecond-tier industrial cities that were destinations for numerous black migrants were [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Boston]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and [[Indianapolis]], and smaller industrial cities such as [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]],  [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban white working class (often recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfrican Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries.

With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. [[Mortgage discrimination]] and [[redlining]] in [[inner city]] areas limited the newer African-American migrants' ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price.

Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\n=== Integration and segregation ===\n[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|Sojourner Truth]] housing project in [[Detroit]] erected this sign, 1942]]\nIn cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society.

In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the \"Black Metropolis\". From 1924 to 1929, the \"Black Metropolis\" was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community's entrepreneurs were black during this period. \"The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trcwabash.org/history.html|title=History|website=The Renaissance Collaborative}}</ref> The \"Black Belt\" geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one's level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.<ref>Poe, Tracy N.

With the defense buildup for [[World War II]] and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of blacks leaving the South through the 1960s. After the political and civil gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in the 1970s migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as blacks traveled to new regions of the South for economic opportunity.\n\n== White southern reaction ==\nThe beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although blacks were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: \"Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.\"<ref name=Reich>Reich, Steven A.: ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic''</ref>\n\nWhen the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern blacks in order to induce them to stay.\n\nAs a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of [[black nationalism]], co-operated in attempting to coerce blacks to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it. The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for blacks, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, \"work or fight\" laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize blacks into staying.<ref name=Reich /><ref name=anderson>Anderson, Talmadge and Stewart, James Benjamin: ''Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications''</ref> These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B.
