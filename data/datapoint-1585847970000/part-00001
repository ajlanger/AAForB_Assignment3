{"title_page": "Geobiology (pseudoscience)", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{stub}}\n\nGeobiology is a term used to describe a [[pseudoscience]] which purports to study the effects of the Earth\u2019s [[telluric current]]s and other electromagentic fields upon biological life eg human, animal and plant.\n\nThe term is derived from Ancient Greek g\u0113 (''ge'') meaning \u2018earth\u2019 and \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2; (''bios'') meaning \u2018life\u2019\n\nPractitioners of geobiology will typically use a [[dowsing]] rod, pendulum or their hands to ascertain the location of [[radiation]] and then use this information to make an assesment on its effect on a residential dwelling or workplace and upon localised natural life.\n\nPractitioners may also claim be to able to propitiously locate and model a building on a similar basis to the theories of [[Feng shui]], [[Vastu Shastra]] or use of [[Sacred geometry]]\n\nWithin this pseudoscience, Hartmann Lines (named after Dr [[Ernst Hartmann]]) and Curry Lines (named after Dr [[Manfred Curry]]) are identifed as forming a grid pattern on the Earth's surface and posited to have a negative effect on health and viability of biological life.  Other patterns of Earth radiation named after practitioners include Peyr\u00e9 lines (after Dr. Francois Peyr\u00e9), Romani lines (after Lucien Romani), Benker cube (after Anton Benker) and Wittmann lines (after Siegfried Wittmann).\n\nUnderground flowing water (groundwater) deemed to create radiation caused by the friction of water against mineral deposits is considered to have a similar effect to the grids mentioned above\n\nGeological faults and the consequent difference in electric charge of the mass each side of the fault is seen as generating radiation which may have an adverse effect on the habitat.\n\nAlso practitioners may claim to locate cosmo-telluric chimneys which are claimed to be a vortex linking the [[Earth]] to the [[Cosmos]]\n\nAs well the phenomena mentioned above, considered inherent to the natural environment, a practitioner of Geobiology will also seek out radiation derived from human activity.
