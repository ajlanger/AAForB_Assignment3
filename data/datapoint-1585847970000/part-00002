It was established in 1910 following the 1907 Court of Appeal Act.\n\nThe BCCA hears appeals from the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] and a number of boards and tribunals. The BCCA also hears criminal appeals from the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]] where the proceedings in that court were by indictment. It will hear summary conviction appeals from the Supreme Court on criminal matters that originated in the Provincial Court. [[Statute]] restricts appeals on civil matters from the Provincial Court (Small Claims) to the Supreme Court. However, some Provincial Court civil matters may come before the BCCA on very narrow matters having to do with questions of administrative law or other unusual circumstances.\n\nThe BCCA consists of 15 justices (including a Chief Justice) in addition to 9 of whom are [[Supernumerary judge|supernumerary]].<ref>[http://www.fja.gc.ca/appointments-nominations/judges-juges-eng.aspx NUMBER OF FEDERALLY APPOINTED JUDGES AS OF JULY 1, 2018, www.fja.gc.ca]</ref> All justices of the BCCA (including the position of Chief Justice) are appointed by the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]. The central registry for the BCCA is in [[Vancouver]], where the BCCA holds most of its sittings. The BCCA also occasionally hears cases in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Kelowna, British Columbia|Kelowna]], and [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]. The judges for the Court also double as judges for the [[Court of Appeal of the Yukon Territory|Yukon Court of Appeal]]. Cases from [[Yukon]] are heard in both Vancouver and in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]].\n\nA full division of the court consists of five justices; however, most cases are heard by a division of three justices. A single justice will preside over matters heard in [[Chambers (law)|\"chambers\"]], usually [[Interlocutory]] matters or applications for leave to appeal.\n\nUnlike in Ontario where a sitting of the Court of Appeal is referred to as a \"panel\", in the BCCA a sitting of the Court is referred to as a \"division\".\n\nCounsel appearing in the BCCA are required to \"gown\".   This court dress is identical to that worn in the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]], and consists of a white wing collar with bands, along with a black bar jacket and black gown (some counsel will wear a black waistcoat and suit rather than a bar jacket).  Male barristers will generally wear black or striped trousers, with female barristers wearing either trousers or a skirt.  Queen's Counsel wear a more elaborate bar jacket as well as a silk gown.  Court dress is not required for matters heard in Chambers, wherein standard business dress can be worn by both counsel and the sitting justice.\n\nWhen the court moved from its previous location (what is now the [[Vancouver Art Gallery#Building|Vancouver Art Gallery]]), one of the old courtrooms was reconstructed in the present [[Arthur Erickson]] designed Vancouver Law Courts. When in session, a division of the court will often preside in this Heritage Courtroom.\n\nAll courts in the Province of British Columbia display the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]], as a symbol of its judiciary.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp judiciary]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Current Justices ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
