toe]]\nThe most common symptom of a fungal nail infection is the nail becoming thickened and discoloured: [https://www.tremedies.com/2020/02/nail-fungus-is-also-known-as.html white, black, yellow or green]. As the infection progresses the nail can become brittle, with pieces breaking off or coming away from the toe or finger completely. If left untreated, the skin underneath and around the nail can become inflamed and painful. There may also be white or yellow patches on the nailbed or scaly skin next to the nail,<ref name=nhs>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Fungal-nail-infection/Pages/Symptoms.aspx NHS Choices: Symptoms of fungal nail infection]</ref> and a foul smell.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=symptoms Mayo clinic: Nail fungus]</ref> There is usually no pain or other bodily symptoms, unless the disease is severe.<ref>{{EMedicine|derm|300|Onychomycosis}}</ref> People with onychomycosis may experience significant [[psychosocial]] problems due to the appearance of the nail, particularly when fingers \u2013 which are always visible \u2013 rather than toenails are affected.<ref name=\"pmid18793262\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Szepietowski JC, Reich A |title= Stigmatisation in onychomycosis patients: a population-based study |journal= Mycoses |volume= 52 |issue= 4 |pages= 343\u20139 |date= September 2008 |pmid= 18793262 |doi= 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01618.x |url=}}</ref>\n[[Dermatophytids]] are fungus-free [[skin lesions]] that sometimes form as a result of a fungus infection in another part of the body. This could take the form of a [[rash]] or [[itch]] in an area of the body that is not infected with the fungus. Dermatophytids can be thought of as an [[allergic reaction]] to the fungus.\n\n==Causes==\nThe causative [[pathogens]] of onychomycosis are all in the [[Fungus|fungus kingdom]] and include [[dermatophyte]]s, ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' ([[yeast]]s), and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s.<ref name=AFP2013/> Dermatophytes are the fungi most commonly responsible for onychomycosis in the temperate western countries; while ''Candida'' and nondermatophytic molds are more frequently involved in the tropics and subtropics with a hot and humid climate.<ref name=\"pmid16262878\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chi CC, Wang SH, Chou MC |title= The causative pathogens of onychomycosis in southern Taiwan |journal= Mycoses |volume= 48 |issue= 6 |pages= 413\u201320 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16262878 |doi= 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2005.01152.x}}</ref>\n\n===Dermatophytes===\nWhen onychomycosis is due to a dermatophyte infection, it is termed tinea unguium. ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' is the most common [[dermatophyte]] involved in onychomycosis. Other dermatophytes that may be involved are ''[[Trichophyton interdigitale|T. interdigitale]]'', ''[[Epidermophyton floccosum]]'', ''T. violaceum'', ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'', ''[[Trichophyton tonsurans|T. tonsurans]]'', and ''[[Trichophyton soudanense|T. soudanense]]''.  A common outdated name that may still be reported by medical laboratories is ''[[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' for ''T. interdigitale''. The name ''T. mentagrophytes'' is now restricted to the agent of [[favus]] skin infection of the [[mouse]]; though this fungus may be transmitted from [[mice]] and their [[dander]]s to humans, it generally infects skin and not nails.\n\n===Other===\nOther causative [[pathogens]] include ''Candida'' and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s, in particular members of the mold genus ''[[Scytalidium]]'' (name recently changed to ''[[Neoscytalidium]]''), ''[[Scopulariopsis]]'', and ''[[Aspergillus]]''.\n''Candida'' species mainly cause fingernail onychomycosis in people whose hands are often submerged in water. ''Scytalidium'' mainly affects people in the [[tropics]], though it persists if they later move to areas of [[temperate climate]].\n\nOther molds more commonly affect people older than 60 years, and their presence in the nail reflects a slight weakening in the nail's ability to defend itself against fungal invasion.\n\n===Risk factors===\nAging is the most common risk factor for onychomycosis due to diminished [[blood circulation]], longer exposure to fungi, and nails which grow more slowly and thicken, increasing susceptibility to infection. Nail fungus tends to affect men more often than women, and is associated with a family history of this infection.\n\nOther risk factors include [[perspiration|perspiring]] heavily, being in a humid or moist environment, [[psoriasis]], wearing socks and shoes that hinder ventilation and do not absorb perspiration, going barefoot in damp public places such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms, having [[athlete's foot]] (tinea pedis), minor skin or nail injury, damaged nail, or other infection, and having diabetes, circulation problems, which may also lead to lower peripheral temperatures on hands and feet, or a weakened immune system.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=risk-factors Mayo Clinic \u2013 Nail fungus \u2013 risk factors]</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing.<ref name=AFP2013/> The four main tests are a [[KOH test|potassium hydroxide smear]], [[tissue culture|culture]], [[histology]] examination, and [[polymerase chain reaction]].<ref name=AFP2013/><ref name=Mer2017/> The sample examined is generally nail scrapings or clippings.<ref name=AFP2013/> These being from as far up the nail as possible.<ref name=Mer2017/>\n\nNail plate [[biopsy]] with [[periodic acid-Schiff stain]] appear more useful than culture or direct KOH examination.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Velasquez-Agudelo |first1=V |last2=Cardona-Arias |first2=JA |title=Meta-analysis of the utility of culture, biopsy, and direct KOH examination for the diagnosis of onychomycosis. |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases |date=22 February 2017 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=166 |doi=10.1186/s12879-017-2258-3 |pmid=28222676|pmc=5320683 }}</ref> To reliably identify nondermatophyte molds, several samples may be necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shemer A, Davidovici B, Grunwald MH, Trau H, Amichai B |title= New criteria for the laboratory diagnosis of nondermatophyte moulds in onychomycosis |journal= The British Journal of Dermatology |volume= 160 |issue= 1 |pages= 37\u20139 |year= 2009 |pmid= 18764841 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08805.x}}</ref>\n\n===Classification===\nThere are four classic types of onychomycosis:<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book|author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology|publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc=|doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G.}}</ref>\n*[[Distal subungual onychomycosis]] is the most common form of ''tinea unguium''<ref name=AFP2013/> and is usually caused by ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'', which invades the [[fingernail|nail bed]] and the underside of the [[nail plate]].\n*[[White superficial onychomycosis]] (WSO) is caused by fungal invasion of the superficial layers of the nail plate to form \"white islands\" on the plate. It accounts for around 10 percent of onychomycosis cases. In some cases, WSO is a misdiagnosis of \"keratins granulations\" which are not a fungus, but a reaction to nail polish that can cause the nails to have a chalky white appearance. A laboratory test should be performed to confirm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmecorner.com/macmcm/aapa/aapa2004_05.htm|title=AAPA |publisher=Cmecorner.com |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref>\n*[[Proximal subungual onychomycosis]] is fungal penetration of the newly formed nail plate through the proximal [[eponychium|nail fold]].

In conclusion the authors say that terbinafine has a relatively benign adverse effect profile, with liver damage very rare, so it makes more sense cost-wise for the dermatologist to prescribe the treatment without doing the PAS test. (Another option would be to prescribe the treatment only if the potassium hydroxide test is positive, but it gives a false negative in about 20% of cases of fungal infection.)

toe]]\nThe most common symptom of a fungal nail infection is the nail becoming thickened and discoloured: white, black, yellow or green. As the infection progresses the nail can become brittle, with pieces breaking off or coming away from the toe or finger completely. If left untreated, the skin underneath and around the nail can become inflamed and painful. There may also be white or yellow patches on the nailbed or scaly skin next to the nail,<ref name=nhs>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Fungal-nail-infection/Pages/Symptoms.aspx NHS Choices: Symptoms of fungal nail infection]</ref> and a foul smell.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=symptoms Mayo clinic: Nail fungus]</ref> There is usually no pain or other bodily symptoms, unless the disease is severe.<ref>{{EMedicine|derm|300|Onychomycosis}}</ref> People with onychomycosis may experience significant [[psychosocial]] problems due to the appearance of the nail, particularly when fingers \u2013 which are always visible \u2013 rather than toenails are affected.<ref name=\"pmid18793262\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Szepietowski JC, Reich A |title= Stigmatisation in onychomycosis patients: a population-based study |journal= Mycoses |volume= 52 |issue= 4 |pages= 343\u20139 |date= September 2008 |pmid= 18793262 |doi= 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01618.x |url=}}</ref>\n[[Dermatophytids]] are fungus-free [[skin lesions]] that sometimes form as a result of a fungus infection in another part of the body. This could take the form of a [[rash]] or [[itch]] in an area of the body that is not infected with the fungus. Dermatophytids can be thought of as an [[allergic reaction]] to the fungus.\n\n==Causes==\nThe causative [[pathogens]] of onychomycosis are all in the [[Fungus|fungus kingdom]] and include [[dermatophyte]]s, ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' ([[yeast]]s), and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s.<ref name=AFP2013/> Dermatophytes are the fungi most commonly responsible for onychomycosis in the temperate western countries; while ''Candida'' and nondermatophytic molds are more frequently involved in the tropics and subtropics with a hot and humid climate.<ref name=\"pmid16262878\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chi CC, Wang SH, Chou MC |title= The causative pathogens of onychomycosis in southern Taiwan |journal= Mycoses |volume= 48 |issue= 6 |pages= 413\u201320 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16262878 |doi= 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2005.01152.x}}</ref>\n\n===Dermatophytes===\nWhen onychomycosis is due to a dermatophyte infection, it is termed tinea unguium. ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' is the most common [[dermatophyte]] involved in onychomycosis. Other dermatophytes that may be involved are ''[[Trichophyton interdigitale|T. interdigitale]]'', ''[[Epidermophyton floccosum]]'', ''T. violaceum'', ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'', ''[[Trichophyton tonsurans|T. tonsurans]]'', and ''[[Trichophyton soudanense|T. soudanense]]''.  A common outdated name that may still be reported by medical laboratories is ''[[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' for ''T. interdigitale''. The name ''T. mentagrophytes'' is now restricted to the agent of [[favus]] skin infection of the [[mouse]]; though this fungus may be transmitted from [[mice]] and their [[dander]]s to humans, it generally infects skin and not nails.\n\n===Other===\nOther causative [[pathogens]] include ''Candida'' and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s, in particular members of the mold genus ''[[Scytalidium]]'' (name recently changed to ''[[Neoscytalidium]]''), ''[[Scopulariopsis]]'', and ''[[Aspergillus]]''.\n''Candida'' species mainly cause fingernail onychomycosis in people whose hands are often submerged in water. ''Scytalidium'' mainly affects people in the [[tropics]], though it persists if they later move to areas of [[temperate climate]].\n\nOther molds more commonly affect people older than 60 years, and their presence in the nail reflects a slight weakening in the nail's ability to defend itself against fungal invasion.\n\n===Risk factors===\nAging is the most common risk factor for onychomycosis due to diminished [[blood circulation]], longer exposure to fungi, and nails which grow more slowly and thicken, increasing susceptibility to infection. Nail fungus tends to affect men more often than women, and is associated with a family history of this infection.\n\nOther risk factors include [[perspiration|perspiring]] heavily, being in a humid or moist environment, [[psoriasis]], wearing socks and shoes that hinder ventilation and do not absorb perspiration, going barefoot in damp public places such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms, having [[athlete's foot]] (tinea pedis), minor skin or nail injury, damaged nail, or other infection, and having diabetes, circulation problems, which may also lead to lower peripheral temperatures on hands and feet, or a weakened immune system.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=risk-factors Mayo Clinic \u2013 Nail fungus \u2013 risk factors]</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing.<ref name=AFP2013/> The four main tests are a [[KOH test|potassium hydroxide smear]], [[tissue culture|culture]], [[histology]] examination, and [[polymerase chain reaction]].<ref name=AFP2013/><ref name=Mer2017/> The sample examined is generally nail scrapings or clippings.<ref name=AFP2013/> These being from as far up the nail as possible.<ref name=Mer2017/>\n\nNail plate [[biopsy]] with [[periodic acid-Schiff stain]] appear more useful than culture or direct KOH examination.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Velasquez-Agudelo |first1=V |last2=Cardona-Arias |first2=JA |title=Meta-analysis of the utility of culture, biopsy, and direct KOH examination for the diagnosis of onychomycosis. |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases |date=22 February 2017 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=166 |doi=10.1186/s12879-017-2258-3 |pmid=28222676|pmc=5320683 }}</ref> To reliably identify nondermatophyte molds, several samples may be necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shemer A, Davidovici B, Grunwald MH, Trau H, Amichai B |title= New criteria for the laboratory diagnosis of nondermatophyte moulds in onychomycosis |journal= The British Journal of Dermatology |volume= 160 |issue= 1 |pages= 37\u20139 |year= 2009 |pmid= 18764841 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08805.x}}</ref>\n\n===Classification===\nThere are four classic types of onychomycosis:<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book|author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology|publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc=|doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G.}}</ref>\n*[[Distal subungual onychomycosis]] is the most common form of ''tinea unguium''<ref name=AFP2013/> and is usually caused by ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'', which invades the [[fingernail|nail bed]] and the underside of the [[nail plate]].\n*[[White superficial onychomycosis]] (WSO) is caused by fungal invasion of the superficial layers of the nail plate to form \"white islands\" on the plate. It accounts for around 10 percent of onychomycosis cases. In some cases, WSO is a misdiagnosis of \"keratins granulations\" which are not a fungus, but a reaction to nail polish that can cause the nails to have a chalky white appearance. A laboratory test should be performed to confirm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmecorner.com/macmcm/aapa/aapa2004_05.htm|title=AAPA |publisher=Cmecorner.com |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref>\n*[[Proximal subungual onychomycosis]] is fungal penetration of the newly formed nail plate through the proximal [[eponychium|nail fold]].

Even if the cheaper [[KOH test]] is used first and the PAS test is used only if the KOH test is negative, there is a good chance that the PAS will be done (because of either a true or a false negative with the KOH test). But the terbinafine treatment costs only $10 (plus an additional $43 for liver function tests). In conclusion the authors say that terbinafine has a relatively benign adverse effect profile, with liver damage very rare, so it makes more sense cost-wise for the dermatologist to prescribe the treatment without doing the PAS test. (Another option would be to prescribe the treatment only if the potassium hydroxide test is positive, but it gives a false negative in about 20% of cases of fungal infection.) On the other hand, as of 2015 the price of topical (non-oral) treatment with [[efinaconazole]] was $2307 ''per nail'', so testing is recommended before prescribing it.<ref name=Mikailov>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mikailov A, Cohen J, Joyce C, Mostaghimi A |title= Cost-effectiveness of Confirmatory Testing Before Treatment of Onychomycosis |journal= JAMA Dermatology |volume= 152 |issue= 3 |year= 2015 |pmid= 26716567 |doi= 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.4190 |pages=1\u20136}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nFollowing effective treatment, recurrence is common (10&ndash;50%).<ref name=AFP2013/> Nail fungus can be painful and cause permanent damage to nails. It may lead to other serious infections if the immune system is suppressed due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. The risk is most serious for people with diabetes and with immune systems weakened by leukemia or AIDS, or medication after organ transplant. Diabetics have vascular and nerve impairment, and are at risk of [[cellulitis]], a potentially serious bacterial infection; any relatively minor injury to feet, including a nail fungal infection, can lead to more serious complications.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=complications Mayo clinic \u2013 Nail fungus: complications]</ref> [[Osteomyelitis|Infection of the bone]] is another rare complication.<ref name=nhs/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nA 2003 survey of diseases of the foot in 16 European countries found onychomycosis to be the most frequent fungal foot infection and estimates its prevalence at 27%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Burzykowski T, Molenberghs G, Abeck D, Haneke E, Hay R, Katsambas A, Roseeuw D, van de Kerkhof P, van Aelst R, Marynissen G |title= High prevalence of foot diseases in Europe: Results of the Achilles Project |journal= Mycoses |volume= 46 |issue= 11\u201312 |pages= 496\u2013505 |year= 2003 |pmid= 14641624 |pmc= |doi= 10.1046/j.0933-7407.2003.00933.x|hdl= 1942/429 }}</ref><ref>Verma S, Heffernan MP (2008).
