In January 1969 he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast---then illegal in the USSR---of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student [[Jan Palach]]. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the [[University of Latvia]], attempted [[self-immolation]] in a protest against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked cloths ablaze. A group of bystanders were able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips' neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated.  He was incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. After his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a wave of petitions, Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, he was allowed to [[aliyah|immigrate]] to [[Israel]].\n\nRips joined the Department of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the  [[Aharon Karzir Prize]]. In 1979, Rips received the [[Erd\u0151s Prize]] from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994.\n\n==Academic career==\nRips is a professor in the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University. His research interests are geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees.\n\nRips' work on [[Group action (mathematics)|group actions]] on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees is mostly unpublished. The [[Rips machine]], in the hands of Rips and his student [[Zlil Sela]], has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the [[Group isomorphism problem|isomorphism problem]] for [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\n==''The Bible Code'' controversy==\n{{main|Bible code}}\nIn the late 1970s, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah.
