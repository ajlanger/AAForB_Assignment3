It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a critical positive response from critics despite tepid success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality and begins to hallucinate, in which she is mocked by a crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to medication. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curl into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me.

Aronofsky had been a fan of Selby's work since his college years. Describing Selby's work, Aronofsky said, \"Anyone that reads Selby's work can see how intense his world is. He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books. I knew that once I made a larger film it would be very difficult to do a project like this.

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoiding reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a critical positive response from critics despite tepid success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality and begins to hallucinate, in which she is mocked by a crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to medication. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curl into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.
