(1980) was an avant-garde documentary written and directed by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] and semiologist Peter Wollen. In the 1991 Australian television miniseries [[The Great Air Race (miniseries)|''The Great Air Race'']], aka ''Half a World Away'', based on the 1934 [[MacRobertson Air Race]], Johnson was portrayed by [[Caroline Goodall]].\n\nJohnson earned a passing mention in other works such as  the 2007 British film adaption of [[Noel Streatfeild]]'s 1936 novel ''[[Ballet Shoes (novel)|Ballet Shoes]]'', wherein the character Petrova is inspired by Johnson in her dreams of becoming an aviatrix.\n\nIn radio, the 2002 [[BBC Radio]] broadcast ''The Typist who Flew to Australia'', a play by Helen Cross, presented the theme that Johnson's aviation career was prompted by years of boredom in an unsatisfying job as a typist and sexual adventures including a seven-year affair with a Swiss businessman who married someone else.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0076b6g |title=BBC Radio 4 Extra - Helen Cross - The Typist Who Flew to Australia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn music, Johnson inspired a number of works, including the song \"Flying Sorcery\" from Scottish singer-songwriter [[Al Stewart]]'s album, ''[[Year of the Cat]]'' (1976).<ref>Dyer, Kim (29 January 2016), [https://www.alstewart.com/blog.html \"Review of 'Flying Sorcery'.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413085234/https://www.alstewart.com/blog.html |date=13 April 2016 }} ''alstewart.com.''

In 1942, a film of Johnson's life, ''[[They Flew Alone]]'', was made by director-producer [[Herbert Wilcox]], starring [[Anna Neagle]] as Johnson, and [[Robert Newton]] as Mollison. The movie is known in the United States as ''Wings and the Woman''.  ''Amy!'' (1980) was an avant-garde documentary written and directed by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] and semiologist Peter Wollen. In the 1991 Australian television miniseries [[The Great Air Race (miniseries)|''The Great Air Race'']], aka ''Half a World Away'', based on the 1934 [[MacRobertson Air Race]], Johnson was portrayed by [[Caroline Goodall]].\n\nJohnson earned a passing mention in other works such as  the 2007 British film adaption of [[Noel Streatfeild]]'s 1936 novel ''[[Ballet Shoes (novel)|Ballet Shoes]]'', wherein the character Petrova is inspired by Johnson in her dreams of becoming an aviatrix.\n\nIn radio, the 2002 [[BBC Radio]] broadcast ''The Typist who Flew to Australia'', a play by Helen Cross, presented the theme that Johnson's aviation career was prompted by years of boredom in an unsatisfying job as a typist and sexual adventures including a seven-year affair with a Swiss businessman who married someone else.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0076b6g |title=BBC Radio 4 Extra - Helen Cross - The Typist Who Flew to Australia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn music, Johnson inspired a number of works, including the song \"Flying Sorcery\" from Scottish singer-songwriter [[Al Stewart]]'s album, ''[[Year of the Cat]]'' (1976).<ref>Dyer, Kim (29 January 2016), [https://www.alstewart.com/blog.html \"Review of 'Flying Sorcery'.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413085234/https://www.alstewart.com/blog.html |date=13 April 2016 }} ''alstewart.com.''
