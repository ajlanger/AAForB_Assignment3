A Swiss military company improperly stored machine gun cooling oil in canisters that were also used for cooking oil. 74 soldiers were poisoned in [[M\u00fcmliswil-Ramiswil|Ramiswil]] and 10-12 civilians, too \u2013 because the soldiers had shared rations with them. They were known as \"[[Oil soldiers]]\" (''\u00d6lsoldaten'' in German). In the same year, a similar case occurred in central Switzerland when 17 soldiers ate salad with contaminated oil. In the winter of 1941/1942, torpedo oil was stolen from the torpedo trial facility at [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]], Germany, and was, due to scarcity of proper cooking oil, used in private households. About 70 people were affected in what was known as the \"Eckernf\u00f6rder Krankheit\" (disease of Eckernf\u00f6rde). Similar outbreaks happened in the harbor town of [[Kiel]] (1944) and again at Eckernf\u00f6rde (1949). Incidentally, torpedo oil from [[World War 1]] did not use additives, and in times of distress, it was used for cooking \u2013 without ill effects.\n\nAnother large outbreak of TOCP poisoning occurred in [[Meknes]], Morocco, in the 1960s. Of the 10,000 cases, nearly all of them were Arab and middle class, with the majority being women. The condition was found to be caused by the adulteration of cooking oil with lubricating oil used in jet engines which contained 3% mixed cresyl phosphates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Travers|first1=P.

A Swiss military company improperly stored machine gun cooling oil in canisters that were also used for cooking oil. 74 soldiers were poisoned in [[M\u00fcmliswil-Ramiswil|Ramiswil]] and 10-12 civilians, too \u2013 because the soldiers had shared rations with them. They were known as \"[[Oil soldiers]]\" (''\u00d6lsoldaten'' in German). In the same year, a similar case occurred in central Switzerland when 17 soldiers ate salad with contaminated oil. In the winter of 1941/1942, torpedo oil was stolen from the torpedo trial facility at [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]], Germany, and was, due to scarcity of proper cooking oil, used in private households. About 70 people were affected in what was known as the \"Eckernf\u00f6rder Krankheit\" (disease of Eckernf\u00f6rde). Similar outbreaks happened in the harbor town of [[Kiel]] (1944) and again at Eckernf\u00f6rde (1949). Incidentally, torpedo oil from [[World War 1]] did not use additives, and in times of distress, it was used for cooking \u2013 without ill effects.\n\nAnother large outbreak of TOCP poisoning occurred in [[Meknes]], Morocco, in the 1960s. Of the 10,000 cases, nearly all of them were Arab and middle class, with the majority being women. The condition was found to be caused by the adulteration of cooking oil with lubricating oil used in jet engines which contained 3% mixed cresyl phosphates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Travers|first1=P.

This poisoning was determined to be caused by contamination of cooking oil that was transported in barrels that had previously stored mineral oil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rege|first1=Rekha S.|last2=Singhal|first2=Pushpa R.|last3=Kulkarni|first3=Dinanath V.|title=Handbook of Indices of Food Quality and Authenticity|date=1997|publisher=Woodhead|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781855732995|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Acetylcholine metabolism and transport modulators}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tricresyl Phosphate}}\n[[Category:Organophosphates]]\n[[Category:Solvents]]\n[[Category:Plasticizers]]\n[[Category:Fuel additives]]\n[[Category:Prohibition in the United States]]\n[[Category:Neurotoxins]]\n[[Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]\n[[Category:Phosphate esters]]\n", "name_user": "Widefox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:def acro per MOS, fix XML", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricresyl_phosphate"}
