During the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by [[Pierre Montet]], then by [[Jean Yoyotte]] and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921}} For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or [[Merenptah]] led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the [[Year 400 Stela]] at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former [[Hyksos]] capital, [[Avaris]]. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses ([[Qantir]]) and Avaris ([[Tell el-Dab'a]]) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921\u20132}}\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to [[Amun]], and a very important royal [[necropolis]] of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials&nbsp;\u2014 the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties&nbsp;\u2014 [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and [[Shoshenq II]] &nbsp;\u2014 survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]] and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, [[lapis lazuli]] and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\n\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the \"northern Thebes\".\n\nIn 2009, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Culture Ministry]] reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late [[25th Dynasty|25th]]\u2013early [[26th Dynasty]].<ref>[https://www.egyptindependent.com/sacred-lake-found-delta/ Bossone, Andrew.

During the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by [[Pierre Montet]], then by [[Jean Yoyotte]] and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921}} For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or [[Merenptah]] led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the [[Year 400 Stela]] at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former [[Hyksos]] capital, [[Avaris]]. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses ([[Qantir]]) and Avaris ([[Tell el-Dab'a]]) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921\u20132}}\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to [[Amun]], and a very important royal [[necropolis]] of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials&nbsp;\u2014 the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties&nbsp;\u2014 [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and [[Shoshenq II]] &nbsp;\u2014 survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]] and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, [[lapis lazuli]] and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\n\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the \"northern Thebes\".\n\nIn 2009, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Culture Ministry]] reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late [[25th Dynasty|25th]]\u2013early [[26th Dynasty]].<ref>[https://www.egyptindependent.com/sacred-lake-found-delta/ Bossone, Andrew.
