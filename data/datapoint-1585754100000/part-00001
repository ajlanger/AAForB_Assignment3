In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).\nFurthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane.

But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.{{who|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===\nNeglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.<ref>Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.</ref> Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.

Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]\n\nIn the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.<ref>For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, \"Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics\"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.</ref> The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,<ref>For a definition of \"Horizontal axis\" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html</ref> is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.\n\nThe following hold in the two-dimensional case:\n# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.\n# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.\n# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.\n#Vertical lines do not cross each other.\n\nNot all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.\n\n===In three dimensions===\nIn the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.\n\n=== In the classroom===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]\nIn the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.\n\n==Discussion==\n{{cleanup merge|Horizontal plane}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|A spirit level on a shelf]]\n\nAlthough the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.\n\n* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.\n[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|left|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]\n* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.\n* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.\n[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]\n* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.\n* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).\n* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.\n\nIn general or in practice, something that is horizontal can be [[Drawing|drawn]] from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Practical use in daily life===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]\nThe concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.\n\nThis dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.\nIn graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n* [[Coordinate system]]\n* [[Horizon]]\n* [[Horizontal coordinate system]]\n* [[Local tangent plane]]\n* [[Northing and easting]]\n* [[Transverse plane]]\n* [[Vertical and horizontal (radio propagation)]]\n* [[Vertical circle]]\n* [[Vertical position]]\n* [[Zenith]]\n{{Col div end}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Brennan, David A.; Esplen, Matthew F.; Gray, Jeremy J.

For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).\n* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.\n\nIn general or in practice, something that is horizontal can be [[Drawing|drawn]] from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Practical use in daily life===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]\nThe concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.\n\nThis dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.\nIn graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n* [[Coordinate system]]\n* [[Horizon]]\n* [[Horizontal coordinate system]]\n* [[Local tangent plane]]\n* [[Northing and easting]]\n* [[Transverse plane]]\n* [[Vertical and horizontal (radio propagation)]]\n* [[Vertical circle]]\n* [[Vertical position]]\n* [[Zenith]]\n{{Col div end}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Brennan, David A.; Esplen, Matthew F.; Gray, Jeremy J.
