SpaceX currently manufactures and operates the [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust]] family of [[medium-lift launch vehicle]]s and the [[Falcon Heavy]] family of [[heavy-lift launch vehicle]]s \u2013 both of which powered by SpaceX's [[Merlin (rocket engine family)|Merlin]] engines and employing [[VTVL]] technologies to [[Reusable launch system|reuse]] the first stage. As of 2019, the company is also developing the fully reusable [[SpaceX Starship|Starship]] launch system, which will replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.\n\nSpaceX's first launch vehicle family, the [[Falcon 1]], was the first [[Private spaceflight|privately developed]] liquid fuel launch vehicle to be launched into orbit, and utilized SpaceX's Merlin and [[Kestrel (rocket engine)|Kestrel]] engines for its first and second stages, respectively. It was launched five times from [[Omelek Island]] between 2006 and 2009 \u2013 the [[Falcon 1e]] and [[Falcon 5]] variants were planned but never developed. The [[Falcon 9 v1.0]] series of launch vehicles, utilizing upgraded Merlin engines on both its stages, was developed as part of the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[National Security Space Launch|Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] program and [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] program. It was first launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] in 2010 and later replaced by the [[Falcon 9 v1.1]] series in 2013, which was also launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base|Vandenberg]]. The [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] variants followed in 2015 and 2018, and are both launched from [[Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy]], in addition to Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[Elon Musk]], CEO of SpaceX, has stated that the Falcon 1, 9, and Heavy are named after the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwMIAKabRng |title= Joseph Gordon-Levitt at SpaceX |publisher= Youtube |page= timeindex 2:25 }}</ref>\n\n== Current launch vehicles ==\n=== Falcon 9 \"Full Thrust\" ===\n{{Main|Falcon 9 Full Thrust}}\n[[File:Crew Demo-1 Mission (39684491043).jpg|thumb|The Dragon capsule sits atop the Falcon 9 rocket before the  Demo-1 launch.]]\nThe \"Full Thrust\" version of Falcon 9 is an upgraded version of the Falcon 9 v1.1. It was used the first time on 22 December 2015 for the ORBCOMM-2 launch at Cape Canaveral SLC-40 launch pad.\n\nThe first stage was upgraded with a larger [[liquid oxygen]] tank, loaded with [[subcooled]] propellants to allow a greater mass of fuel in the same tank volume.

Its stated business objective was the development of launch services for a fraction of the cost of the then-available commercial launch providers \u2013 to the greatest extent practicable, they would create reusable pieces of its launch system, thereby greatly lowering the cost of space access.  Toward that end, SpaceX sponsored the development of its own launch vehicle and engines, using a vertically integrated business model in which SpaceX would design, fabricate, prepare and operate a launch system.\n\nAlan Boyle\u2019s recent review of commercial efforts to supply the International Space Station naturally included coverage of the successful flight of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon\u2019s delivery demonstration.  The article focused on the way commercial space is financed, specifically how NASA is sponsoring the development of some of these capabilities.  This financial arrangement is the basis for a point repeatedly voiced by critics of the heralded vision of \u201cNew Space\u201d replacing \u201cgovernment\u201d space \u2013 a company like SpaceX is not actually commercial in the traditional free market sense, but simply another government-funded contractor using a different procurement model.\n\nFalcon 1 was the first rocket developed by SpaceX.  It is a two-stage launch vehicle capable of putting a metric ton (1000 kg) into low Earth orbit.  Falcon 1 uses a single Merlin, a SpaceX-developed, LOX-kerosene rocket engine producing ~570,000 newtons of thrust (for comparison, a single Shuttle main engine burns LOX-hydrogen fuel and produces about 2,300,000 newtons of thrust).  The Falcon 1 was designed to put relatively small satellites into low earth orbit.  With such payload capacity, it is also capable of sending 100-200 kg microsats beyond LEO, into cislunar space.\n\nMuch of the private start-up capital for SpaceX was used to develop the Falcon 1.  They also received some government funding from other than NASA.  The Department of Defense (DoD) had need for reliable, quick, and cheap space access for small payloads.  To that end, SpaceX received funding from several DoD entities, including several million dollars from the U.S. Air Force under a program to develop launch capability for DARPA (a defense research agency).  Space X was given access to and the use of DoD launch facilities at the Reagan Test Site (formerly Kwajalein Missile Range) in the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe early days of Falcon 1 development were not pretty.  The first launch failed after 25 seconds of flight.  The second flight successfully launched and staged, but did not reach orbit.  After the third attempt at flight failed during staging, a review board looked in detail at SpaceX\u2019s launch processing stream and made recommendations for some significant changes.  The next launch was successful in putting a dummy payload into orbit.  In July 2009, six years after Falcon 1 development had begun, SpaceX achieved its first (and so far, only) commercial space success with the launch and orbit of the Malaysian RazakSAT imaging satellite on a Falcon 1 launch.\n\nTypically when a space company finally achieves a long-sought success, it moves rapidly to exploit the new vehicle\u2019s operational status and begins to aggressively market and sell its new launch service.  However, no Falcon 1 launch has occurred since the success of RazakSAT.  A visit to the SpaceX web site describes the Falcon 1 vehicle, but at the bottom of the page it states that a Falcon 1 launch is no longer available for purchase.  Instead, small, one-ton class payloads will be accommodated in the future through \u201cpiggyback\u201d rides on the new, Falcon 9 medium-class launch vehicle.\n\nFor a company to spend six years and start up money developing a needed launch system, only to abandon it just as success and profit is at hand, is difficult to sort through.  One could be forgiven for imagining that the development of the Falcon 1 as a commercial launch system was never intended but rather a pretext to flight qualify the pieces (specifically the Merlin 1 engine) used in the nine-engine cluster that powers the Falcon 9 launcher.  Interestingly, others have noted that the now-cancelled NASA Constellation Ares I launch vehicle (\u201cThe Stick\u201d), purportedly designed to launch the new Orion spacecraft to LEO, likewise appeared to be more of a development effort than a flight project, in that its various pieces (e.g., cryogenic upper stage, five-segment SRB) were all needed to build the large Ares V heavy lift rocket.\n\nMeanwhile, customers in need of low-cost options for launching small payloads are out of luck.  Falcon 9 has yet to launch an ounce of commercial payload and Falcon 1 is not for sale.  Of course, one can launch small satellites using Orbital\u2019s Taurus launch vehicle, but its ~$50-70 M cost and recent record of unreliability (e.g., the Glory satellite launch failure) engender neither comfort nor confidence.  More significantly, after investing in the R&D effort of a new, unproven company that was offering a low cost, small launch vehicle, SpaceX\u2019s original DoD customers, banking on the creation of a quick, inexpensive capability to launch small satellites, saw their support of Falcon 1 go by the board.  It appears that SpaceX dropped their initial operational vehicle for the promotion and promise of far more ambitious and distant goals.\n\nThat template seems to work for them \u2013 NASA has \u201cinvested\u201d more than $500 million in the Falcon 9 over the last five years.  Now, SpaceX holds court to advance their founder\u2019s Mars fantasies and plans for a Falcon \u201cheavy\u201d launch vehicle \u2013 designed and marketed as sending very large payloads into space, at unbelievably low prices.
