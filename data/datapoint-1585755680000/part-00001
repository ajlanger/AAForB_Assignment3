The project remained nameless and dormant for a number of years. With the help and inspiration of his good friend Parker, they casually brought the project back to life in the winter of 1998. With his input, they developed collective song ideas into the ''[[Rise of the Great Machine]]'' album. Bannon structured the lyrical content around his feelings on the rise of technology and the death of the individual, making the project thematic in its content. They entered [[Kurt Ballou#GodCity Studio|GodCity Studios]] with [[Kurt Ballou]] in the winter of 1999 to take on the piles of old four track tapes they had. Ballou contributed a great deal to the album material both as an engineer and musician and both Ballou and the band brought something to the table. After the recording was complete, there was little/no time to carry on with the project. The original ''Rise of the Great Machine'' CD was released by the Undecided label in 2000 (now out of print). After the album was released future projects were planned but never materialized. However Bannon continued to write music that was sonically different from Converge, which was later released as solo martial many years later.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobbannon.com/pages/about-us|title=ABOUT|website=Jacobbannon.com|access-date=2016-12-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Dear Lover22\">{{cite web|url=http://www.creative-eclipse.com/file/interviews13.htm|title=Interview - Dear Lover|last=Jaschke|first=Magnus|date=May 2003|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref>\n\nThe original ''Rise of the Great Machine'' CD was released by Undecided Records in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Supermachiner-Rise-Of-The-Great-Machine/release/1025362|title=Supermachiner - Rise Of The Great Machine|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}</ref> In 2004, the album was sold at Converge's ''[[You Fail Me]]'' 2004 tour, this version of the album was limited to 50 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Supermachiner-Rise-Of-The-Great-Machine/release/5937085|title=Supermachiner - Rise Of The Great Machine|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}</ref> The album was reissued in 2008, released by the E-Vinyl label in France, it was released as a one time pressing as a deluxe double vinyl, limited to 1000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Supermachiner-Rise-Of-The-Great-Machine/release/1447560|title=Supermachiner - Rise Of The Great Machine|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}</ref> Eight years after the release of ''Rise of the Great Machine'', [[Deathwish Inc.]] announced the release of ''[[Rise of the Great Machine|Rust]]'', a 30 track double CD that featured remastered versions of the ''Rise of the Great Machine'' tracks along with [[b-sides]] of forgotten songs and additional audio experiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.deathwishinc.com/product/DW88.html|title=Deathwish Estore: Supermachiner \"Rust\" 2XCD|website=store.deathwishinc.com|access-date=2016-08-12}}</ref> ''Rust'' was released on March 16, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wearyourwounds.bandcamp.com/album/rust|title=Rust, by Supermachiner|website=Wear Your Wounds|access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n* [[Jacob Bannon]] \u2013 [[vocals]], [[guitar]], [[Electronic musical instrument|electronics]]\n* Ryan Parker \u2013 vocals, [[Bass guitar|bass]], electronics\n\n==Discography==\n;Albums\n* ''[[Rise of the Great Machine]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Rise of the Great Machine#Rust|Rust]]'' (2009)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n[[Category:Musical groups from Boston]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name = Supermachiner\n| background = group_or_band\n| image = <!-- Put only the image name (e.g. Example.png) without the Image: prefix. -->\n| image_size = <!-- Only for images narrower than 220 pixels.
