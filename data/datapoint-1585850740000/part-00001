He read Botany at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] and in 1947 moved to the [[University College of Wales]], first as a research student in Aberystwyth and then as a lecturer in the Department of\nAgricultural Botany at Bangor. There he worked on the adaptation of plants to heavy metal pollution, demonstrating the ability of natural selection to bring about rapid evolutionary changes in natural grasses, even in very localised situations.\n\nIn 1958 he accepted the Chair of Botany at the [[University of Liverpool]] where he pioneered novel ideas of restoration ecology to help recover polluted sites without the need to cover them in imported topsoil. His work on the revegetation of china clay tips in Cornwall formed the basis of the techniques behind the [[Eden Project]].\n\nIn 1982 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].
