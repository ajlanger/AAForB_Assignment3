Following his first commercial video game release, ''[[ZZT]]'' (1991), the company became '''Epic MegaGames, Inc.''' in early 1992 and brought on [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who is the company's [[vice president]] to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games develops the [[Unreal Engine]], a commercially available [[game engine]] which also powers their internally developed video games, such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' and the ''[[Unreal (video game series)|Unreal]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Infinity Blade]]'' series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the \"most successful videogame engine\" by [[Guinness World Records]].<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |title=Most successful videogame engine |website=[[Guinness World Records]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151655/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEpic Games owns video game developers [[Chair Entertainment]] and [[Psyonix]], as well as cloud-based software developer [[Cloudgine]], and operates eponymous sub-studios in [[Seattle]], [[England]], [[Berlin]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Seoul]]. While Sweeney remains the majority shareholder, [[Tencent]] acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a [[games as a service]] model. Following the release of the popular ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish [[esport]] events around ''Fortnite'', and launch the [[Epic Games Store]].
