A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their [[extracellular matrix]] from the same origin that together carry out a specific function.

While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals.\n\nThe epithelium in all animals is derived from the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]], with a small contribution from the [[mesoderm]], forming the [[endothelium]], a specialized type of epithelium that composes the [[blood vessels|vasculature]]. By contrast, a true [[epithelial tissue]] is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called [[tight junctions]], to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the [[skin]], the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, [[secretion]], and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a [[basal lamina]].\n\n=== Epithelial tissue ===\n{{main|Epithelium}}\n\nThe epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces, such as the surface of  [[skin]], the [[airway]]s, surfaces of soft organs,the [[reproductive tract]], and the inner lining of the [[digestive tract]]. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, [[tight junctions]]; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in [[secretion]], [[excretion]] and [[Digestion|absorption]]. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss.\n\nFunctions of epithelial tissue:\n*The principle function of epithelial tissues are covering and lining of free surface\n* The cells of the body's surface form the outer layer of skin.\n* Inside the body, epithelial cells form the lining of the mouth and alimentary canal and protect these organs.\n* Epithelial tissues help in absorption of water and nutrients.\n* Epithelial tissues help in the elimination of waste.\n* Epithelial tissues secrete enzymes and/or hormones in the form of [[gland]]s.\n* Some epithelial tissue perform secretory functions. They secrete a variety of substances including sweat, saliva, mucus, enzymes.\n\nThere are many kinds of epithelium, and nomenclature is somewhat variable. Most classification schemes combine a description of the cell-shape in the upper layer of the epithelium with a word denoting the number of layers: either simple (one layer of cells) or stratified (multiple layers of cells). However, other cellular features such as cilia may also be described in the classification system. Some common kinds of epithelium are listed below:\n\n* Simple squamous epithelium\n* Stratified squamous epithelium\n* Simple cuboidal epithelium\n* Transitional epithelium\n* Pseudostratified columnar epithelium (also known as ciliated columnar epithelium)\n* Columnar epithelium\n* Glandular epithelium\n\n=== Connective tissue ===\n{{Main|Connective tissue}}\n\nConnective tissues are fibrous tissues made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an [[extracellular matrix]]. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose, and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.\n\n=== Muscular tissue ===\n{{Main|Muscle tissue}}\n\n[[Muscle cell]]s form the active contractile tissue of the [[Human body|body]] known as [[muscle tissue]] or muscular tissue. Muscle tissue functions to produce [[force]] and cause [[Motion (physics)|motion]], either [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] or movement within internal organs. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or [[smooth muscle]], found in the inner linings of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]; [[skeletal muscle]], typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and [[cardiac muscle]], found in the [[heart]], where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism.\n\n=== Nervous tissue ===\n{{Main|Nervous tissue}}\n\nCells comprising the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] are classified as nervous (or neural) tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. In the peripheral nervous system, neural tissues form the [[cranial nerves]] and [[spinal nerve]]s, inclusive of the [[motor neuron]]s.\n\n== Plants ==\n[[File:Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg|thumb|right|Cross-section of a [[flax]] plant stem with several layers of different tissue types:<br>\n1.  [[Pith]]<br>\n2.  [[Protoxylem]]<br>\n3.  [[Xylem]] I<br>\n4.  [[Phloem]] I<br>\n5.  [[Sclerenchyma]] ([[bast fibre]])<br>\n6.  [[cortex (botany)|Cortex]]<br>\n7.  [[epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]]]]\n\nIn [[plant anatomy]], tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue systems: the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]], the [[ground tissue]], and the [[vascular tissue]].\n\n* '''[[epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]]''' - Cells forming the outer surface of the [[leaf|leaves]] and of the young plant body.\n* '''[[Vascular tissue]]''' - The primary components of vascular tissue are the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]].  These transport fluids and nutrients internally.\n* '''[[Ground tissue]]''' - Ground tissue is less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] than other tissues.  Ground tissue manufactures nutrients by [[photosynthesis]] and stores reserve nutrients.\n\nPlant tissues can also be divided differently into two types:\n\n# Meristematic tissues\n# Permanent tissues.\n\n=== Meristematic tissues ===\n[[Meristem|Meristematic tissue]] consists of  actively dividing cells, and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant.  The primary growth of a plant occurs only in certain, specific regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in these regions that meristematic tissues are present.  Cells in these tissues are roughly spherical or polyhedral, to rectangular in shape, and have thin cell walls. New cells produced by meristem are initially those of meristem itself, but as the new cells grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of the region of occurrence of meristematic tissues, being classified as:\n* '''Apical meristem ''' - It is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and root. They form growing parts at the apices of roots and stems and are responsible for the increase in length, also called primary growth. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ.\n* ''' Lateral meristem''' - This meristem consists of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of [[vascular cambium]]. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth.\n* '''Intercalary meristem''' - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. It is usually present at the base of the node, internode and on leaf base. They are responsible for growth in length of the plant and increasing the size of the internode. They result in branch formation and growth.\n\nThe cells of meristematic tissues are similar in structure and have thin and elastic primary cell wall made up of [[cellulose]]. They are compactly arranged without inter-cellular spaces between them. Each cell contains a dense [[cytoplasm]] and a prominent [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. The dense [[protoplasm]] of meristematic cells contains very few vacuoles. Normally the meristematic cells are oval, [[polygonal]] or rectangular in shape.\n\nMeristematic tissue cells have a large nucleus with small or no vacuoles as they have no need to store anything, opposed to their function of multiplying and increasing the girth and length of the plant, and no intercellular spaces.\n\n=== Permanent tissues ===\nPermanent tissues may be defined as a group of living or dead cells formed by meristematic tissue and have lost their ability to divide and have permanently placed at fixed positions in the plant body. Meristematic tissues that take up a specific role lose the ability to divide. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size and a function is called [[cellular differentiation]]. Cells of meristematic tissue differentiate to form different types of permanent tissues. There are 3 types of permanent tissues:\n# simple permanent tissues\n# complex permanent tissues\n# special or secretory tissues (glandular).\n\n==== Simple tissues ====\nA group of cells which are similar in origin; similar in structure and similar in function are called simple permanent tissue. They are of three types:\n# [[Parenchyma]]\n# [[Collenchyma]]\n# [[Sclerenchyma]]\n#[[Epidermis]]\n\n===== Parenchyma =====\n[[Parenchyma]] (''para'' - 'beside'; ''infusion'' - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In plants, it consists of relatively unspecialized living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. These are generally isodiametric, in shape. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food.  In some situations, parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, in which case it is called a chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Such a parenchyma type is called [[aerenchyma]]. Some of the parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fiber also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma, succulent parenchyma also noted.In [[xerophytes]], parenchyma tissues store water.\n\n===== Collenchyma =====\n[[File:Plant cell type collenchyma.png|thumb|Cross section of collenchyma cells]]\n\n[[Collenchyma]] is Greek word where \"Colla\" means gum and \"enchyma\" means infusion. It is a living tissue of primary body like [[Parenchyma]]. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of [[cellulose]], water and [[pectin]] substances ([[pectocellulose]]) at the corners where a number of cells join together. This tissue gives tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in [[hypodermis]] of stems and leaves. It is absent in [[monocots]] and in roots. Sometimes it contains chlorophyll which can help them photosynthesize.\n\nCollenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resists tearing effect of the wind.\n\n===== Sclerenchyma =====\n[[Ground tissue#Sclerenchyma|Sclerenchyma]] is Greek word where \"Sclero-\" means hard and \"enchyma\" means infusion. This tissue consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is negligible. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of [[lignin]]. They do not have inter-molecular space between them. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become strong, rigid and impermeable to water which is also known as a stone cell or sclereids. These tissues are mainly of two types: sclerenchyma fiber and sclereids. Sclerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long, narrow and unicellular.\n\n===== Epidermis =====\nThe entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of the epidermis. Hence it is also called  surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells form a continuous sheet without intercellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant. The outer epidermis is coated with a waxy thick layer called cuticle which prevents loss of water. The epidermis also consists of [[stomata]](singular:stoma) which helps in [[transpiration]].\n\n==== Complex permanent tissue ====\nThe complex tissue consists of more than one type of cells which work together as a unit. Complex tissues help in the transportation of organic material, water, and minerals up and down the plants. That is why it is also known as conducting and vascular tissue. The common types of complex permanent tissue are:\n* Xylem or wood\n* Phloem or bast.\n\nXylem and phloem together form vascular bundles.\n\n===== Xylem =====\nXylem consists of:\n* Xylem tracheids\n* Xylem vessel \n* Xylem fibres or Xylem sclerenchyma\n* Xylem parenchyma\n\n[[File:Xylem rays (Tilia Americana).jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of 2-year-old Tilia Americana, highlighting xylem ray shape and orientation.]][[Xylem]] serves as a chief conducting tissue of [[vascular plants]]. \n\nIt is responsible for the conduction of water and mineral ions/salt. \nXylem tissue is organised in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels tracheids, while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids end overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.\n\nThough most conduction in xylem tissue is vertical, lateral conduction along the diameter of a stem is facilitated via rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7409/Wood.html|title=Wood|website=science.jrank.org}}</ref> Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium. In trees and other woody plants, rays radiate out from the center of stems and roots and appear like spokes on a wheel in cross section. Rays, unlike vessel members and tracheids, are alive at functional maturity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/botany_130/anatomy/secondary_growth/|title=Secondary Growth|website=botit.botany.wisc.edu}}</ref>\n\n===== Phloem =====\nPhloem consists of:\n* [[Sieve tube]]\n* [[Companion cell]]\n* Phloem fibre\n* Phloem parenchyma.\n\nPhloem is an equally important plant tissue as it also is part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.\n\n== Mineralized tissues ==\n{{main|Mineralized tissues}}\n\nMineralized tissues are biological tissues that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Such tissues may be found in both plants and animals, as well as algae. Typically these tissues form a protective shield against predation or provide structural support.\n\n==History of the concept==\n[[File:Pierre-Maximilien Delafontaine - Portrait of Marie Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Bichat.jpg|thumb|[[Xavier Bichat]] (1771\u20131802)]]\nThe term was introduced in anatomy by [[Xavier Bichat]] in 1801.<ref>\n{{cite journal \n|last1= Bock\n|first1= Ortwin\n|date= 2015-01-02\n|title= A history of the development of histology up to the end of the nineteenth century \n|url= https://www.labome.org/research/A-history-of-the-development-of-histology-up-to-the-end-of-the-nineteenth-century.html\n|journal= Research\n|volume= 2015;2:1283\n|issue= \n|pages= \n|doi= 10.13070/rs.en.2.1283\n|doi-broken-date= 2020-01-22\n}}\n</ref> He was \"the first to propose that tissue is a central element in [[human anatomy]], and he considered [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves\".<ref name=\"Lindahall\">{{cite web|title=Xavier Bichat|website=LindaHall.org|url=https://www.lindahall.org/xavier-bichat/}}</ref>\nAlthough he worked without a [[microscope]], Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed,<ref name=\"Roeckelein1998\">{{harvnb|Roeckelein|1998|p=78}}</ref> a number later reduced by other authors.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{annotated link|Cell (biology)|Cells}}\n* {{annotated link|Cellular differentiation}}\n* {{annotated link|Dorothea Pertz}}\n* {{annotated link|Generative tissue}}\n* {{annotated link|Laser capture microdissection}}\n* {{annotated link|Plant stem cell}}\n* {{annotated link|Tissue microarray}}\n* {{annotated link|Tissue stress}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Raven, Peter H., Evert, Ray F., & Eichhorn, Susan E.

Some of the parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fiber also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma, succulent parenchyma also noted.In [[xerophytes]], parenchyma tissues store water.\n\n===== Collenchyma =====\n[[File:Plant cell type collenchyma.png|thumb|Cross section of collenchyma cells]]\n\n[[Collenchyma]] is Greek word where \"Colla\" means gum and \"enchyma\" means infusion. It is a living tissue of primary body like [[Parenchyma]]. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of [[cellulose]], water and [[pectin]] substances ([[pectocellulose]]) at the corners where a number of cells join together. This tissue gives tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in [[hypodermis]] of stems and leaves. It is absent in [[monocots]] and in roots. Sometimes it contains chlorophyll which can help them photosynthesize.\n\nCollenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resists tearing effect of the wind.\n\n===== Sclerenchyma =====\n[[Ground tissue#Sclerenchyma|Sclerenchyma]] is Greek word where \"Sclero-\" means hard and \"enchyma\" means infusion. This tissue consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is negligible. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of [[lignin]]. They do not have inter-molecular space between them. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become strong, rigid and impermeable to water which is also known as a stone cell or sclereids. These tissues are mainly of two types: sclerenchyma fiber and sclereids. Sclerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long, narrow and unicellular.\n\n===== Epidermis =====\nThe entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of the epidermis. Hence it is also called  surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells form a continuous sheet without intercellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant. The outer epidermis is coated with a waxy thick layer called cuticle which prevents loss of water. The epidermis also consists of [[stomata]](singular:stoma) which helps in [[transpiration]].\n\n==== Complex permanent tissue ====\nThe complex tissue consists of more than one type of cells which work together as a unit. Complex tissues help in the transportation of organic material, water, and minerals up and down the plants. That is why it is also known as conducting and vascular tissue. The common types of complex permanent tissue are:\n* Xylem or wood\n* Phloem or bast.\n\nXylem and phloem together form vascular bundles.\n\n===== Xylem =====\nXylem consists of:\n* Xylem tracheids\n* Xylem vessel \n* Xylem fibres or Xylem sclerenchyma\n* Xylem parenchyma\n\n[[File:Xylem rays (Tilia Americana).jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of 2-year-old Tilia Americana, highlighting xylem ray shape and orientation.]][[Xylem]] serves as a chief conducting tissue of [[vascular plants]]. \n\nIt is responsible for the conduction of water and mineral ions/salt. \nXylem tissue is organised in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels tracheids, while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids end overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.\n\nThough most conduction in xylem tissue is vertical, lateral conduction along the diameter of a stem is facilitated via rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7409/Wood.html|title=Wood|website=science.jrank.org}}</ref> Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium. In trees and other woody plants, rays radiate out from the center of stems and roots and appear like spokes on a wheel in cross section. Rays, unlike vessel members and tracheids, are alive at functional maturity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/botany_130/anatomy/secondary_growth/|title=Secondary Growth|website=botit.botany.wisc.edu}}</ref>\n\n===== Phloem =====\nPhloem consists of:\n* [[Sieve tube]]\n* [[Companion cell]]\n* Phloem fibre\n* Phloem parenchyma.\n\nPhloem is an equally important plant tissue as it also is part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.\n\n== Mineralized tissues ==\n{{main|Mineralized tissues}}\n\nMineralized tissues are biological tissues that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Such tissues may be found in both plants and animals, as well as algae. Typically these tissues form a protective shield against predation or provide structural support.\n\n==History of the concept==\n[[File:Pierre-Maximilien Delafontaine - Portrait of Marie Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Bichat.jpg|thumb|[[Xavier Bichat]] (1771\u20131802)]]\nThe term was introduced in anatomy by [[Xavier Bichat]] in 1801.<ref>\n{{cite journal \n|last1= Bock\n|first1= Ortwin\n|date= 2015-01-02\n|title= A history of the development of histology up to the end of the nineteenth century \n|url= https://www.labome.org/research/A-history-of-the-development-of-histology-up-to-the-end-of-the-nineteenth-century.html\n|journal= Research\n|volume= 2015;2:1283\n|issue= \n|pages= \n|doi= 10.13070/rs.en.2.1283\n|doi-broken-date= 2020-01-22\n}}\n</ref> He was \"the first to propose that tissue is a central element in [[human anatomy]], and he considered [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves\".<ref name=\"Lindahall\">{{cite web|title=Xavier Bichat|website=LindaHall.org|url=https://www.lindahall.org/xavier-bichat/}}</ref>\nAlthough he worked without a [[microscope]], Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed,<ref name=\"Roeckelein1998\">{{harvnb|Roeckelein|1998|p=78}}</ref> a number later reduced by other authors.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{annotated link|Cell (biology)|Cells}}\n* {{annotated link|Cellular differentiation}}\n* {{annotated link|Dorothea Pertz}}\n* {{annotated link|Generative tissue}}\n* {{annotated link|Laser capture microdissection}}\n* {{annotated link|Plant stem cell}}\n* {{annotated link|Tissue microarray}}\n* {{annotated link|Tissue stress}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Raven, Peter H., Evert, Ray F., & Eichhorn, Susan E.
