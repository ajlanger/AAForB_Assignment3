The episode aired on June 12, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]] discovers from Irene, one of his former [[elder law]] clients who represents the class in the Sandpiper Crossing [[lawsuit]], that the company has offered a [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]] which if accepted by D&M and HHM will result in a payment to Jimmy of $1.16 million. Irene has refused to accept the settlement because the D&M and HHM lawyers have advised her they believe they can get Sandpiper Crossing to offer more. Jimmy tries to persuade [[Howard Hamlin|Howard]] to accept the settlement, but Howard refuses.\n\nHoward and [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] meet with their [[malpractice insurance]] agents, who inform them that the insurance carrier will need to raise HHM's premium substantially or arrange to have Chuck supervised by another [[Lawyer|attorney]] at all times. Chuck refuses and instead decides to fight the insurance company in [[court]]. Howard disagrees with Chuck's plan, and says Chuck will be forced to retire since his judgment can no longer be trusted. Chuck sues HHM for $8 million, the value of his share of the partnership.\n\n[[Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]] becomes a contracted \"security consultant\" to Madrigal, a paper transaction designed to [[No-show job|launder his stolen money]] by having him give his cash to Lydia, and then receive monthly checks from Madrigal as supposed fees for his expert advice. [[Kim Wexler|Kim]] takes on Gatwood Oil as a second client in order to have an income sufficient to cover office [[expenses]] in case Jimmy can't pay his half while his [[law license]] is suspended. [[Ignacio Varga|Nacho]] admits to his father that he is working for [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]], and begs him to follow Hector's orders. Nacho's father refuses and orders Nacho to leave his house.\n\nJimmy pulls a series of psychological and social manipulation tricks to turn Irene's friends against her, so that she believes refusing the Sandpiper settlement is against the interests of her fellow clients. She decides to accept it, meaning Jimmy will receive his much needed share. He returns to his office to give Kim the good news, but she is too busy preparing for an important meeting with Gatwood Oil and leaves in a rush. Due to [[fatigue]] from [[overwork]], Kim falls asleep at the wheel and drives her car off the side of the road, [[Single-vehicle crash|crashing into a boulder]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Ratings===\nUpon airing, the episode received 1.47 million American viewers, and an 18\u201349 rating of 0.5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-cable-ratings-june-12-2017/|title=Monday cable ratings: \u2018Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta\u2019 leads, \u2018WWE Raw\u2019 dips|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Welch|first=Alex|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe episode received critical acclaim.
