{"title_page": "Memory conformity", "text_new": "The present study examined whether the degree to which participants engage in '''memory conformity''', which occurs when a person alters their memory report of an event to be consistent with another person, can be predicted by their levels of interrogative suggestibility (IS), which is the degree to which people are susceptible to altering their memory reports during questioning. Memory conformity was introduced by having participant and confederate pairs study words and then complete a social recognition test where they took turns to make judgements to the same items. When the participants responded after the confederate, they tended to conform to confederate's judgements regardless of whether the confederate had made a correct or incorrect response. IS was measured using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale 2. This scale allows separate measures of Yield, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to altering their memory reports of events as a result of leading questions, and Shift, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to changing responses to questions when placed under pressure to do so. Only Yield was a significant predictor of memory conformity.\nSocial contamination of false memory can be exemplified in prominent in situations involving social interactions, such as [[eyewitness testimony]].<ref name=\"Valentine\">{{cite journal|last=Valentine|first=Tim|author2=Maras, Katie|year=2011|title=The effect of cross-examination on the accuracy of adult eyewitness testimony|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=554\u2013561|doi=10.1002/acp.1768}}</ref><ref name=Gabbert /><ref name=Luus /> Research on memory conformity has revealed that such [[suggestibility]] and errors with source monitoring has far reaching consequences, with important legal and social implications.

These sources tend to be one's own experience with others and the world, or their own imagination and dreams. Specific and vivid details within each of these helps determine which of the possibilities is the most probable source. For one\u2019s outer experience, these details usually involve the setting and events that occurred around that time. These are then contrasted with other events that have occurred in the past to judge what the source could have been. Personal, concrete experiences are often more vivid and have more detail than imagined experiences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampinen|first=James Michael|title=Memory 101|last2=Beike|first2=Denise R.|date=November 2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-0924-8|location=New York, NY|doi=10.1891/9780826109255}}</ref> Noticing the difference between details and vivid details can help to determine whether a piece of information came from experience or the imagination.\n\nSource monitoring has a relationship with the frontal lobe of the brain, which is the region of the brain that uses judgment to make decisions. The hippocampal region of the brain, involved with memory, is highly used when retrieving information from external events.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hallucinations in psychoses and affective disorders : a clinical and biological approach|others=Brambilla, Paolo,, Mauri, Massimo Carlo,, Altamura, Alfredo Carlo|isbn=978-3-319-75124-5|location=Cham|oclc=1052566803}}</ref> After having recalled a memory or piece of information with the help of the hippocampus, the brain uses its judgment abilities within the prefrontal cortex to determine whether it was received by a specific source or another.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brainerd, Charles J.|title=The science of false memory|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Reyna, Valerie F., 1955-|isbn=978-0-19-803504-6|location=New York|oclc=61341505}}</ref>\n\n'''Source monitoring errors''' is another mechanism underlying memory conformity. A source-monitoring error can lead to an incorrect internal attribution of a memory (the belief that a memory was made from first-hand experience), when in reality that information had an external source (someone else relayed the information).<ref name=\"Revlin\">{{cite book|title=Human Cognition : Theory and Practice.|last=Revlin|first=Russell|publisher=Worth Pub|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7167-5667-5|location=New York, NY|pages=185\u2013186}}</ref> When a piece of information or a memory of an event has similar qualities to that of another, it is possible that the information is confused and stored incorrectly. There are not enough differences to permit a strong enough distinction between the two. This can lead to false attributions when working in relation to sources. For example, when two men were speaking in a previous situation, it may be more difficult to recall which of them presented a specific piece of information when compared to one man and one woman speaking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the psychology of aging|others=Schaie, K.

To show this, a study was done with an Israeli plane crashing in Amsterdam. After being asked where each person had received the news of the event, many falsely reported their source of the information. Most claimed to have seen it on the television, although the event had not been filmed. It is likely that through descriptions of the event and stories, the brain created the event visually, causing the person to think it was seen on television.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kapardis|first=Andreas|title=Psychology and Law: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=1139484893|location=|pages=79}}</ref>\n\n==Important variables==\n\n===Age===\n\nResearchers believe that old age and subsequent memory declines may cause individuals to rely more heavily on external aids, such as conversations with others to improve recall.<ref name=\"Gabbert and Memon fix\" /><ref>Dixon, R.A.

Some photos contained images of an accomplice, while others did not. Immediately after seeing these photographs, participants were asked about the presence of an accomplice in the photographs, as well as their level of confidence in their reports. Initial reports were highly accurate, but after being placed in pairs where each person had seen a slightly different photograph, this pattern changed. Seventy-five percent of the pairs exhibited memory conformity, with one half of the dyad conforming to the other. In almost every case, the less confident person in the pair accepted the more confident person's memory as the correct one.<ref name=Wright />\n\nInternal confidence at the time of memory encoding also affects general social confidence levels. An individual's reliance on another person's memory is constantly changing as the initial encoder takes into account the conditions under which he/she first perceived the event, as well as the conditions (or believed conditions) under which another individual perceived that event.<ref name=\"Allan and Midjord\" /> One study showed that levels of memory conformity between individuals varied based on confidence in the comparative quality of initial viewing conditions.

The presence of dissenters works to decrease the overall group certainty and group unity, which decreases social conformity among group members, thus increasing individual internal reliance.<ref name=Walther/> Research suggests that the clarity of a participant's recollection of a memory plays a role in within-group recollection: as clarity and internal confidence increase, the pressure to conform to the group decreases. The same research goes on to show that false reports from confederates within a group influence participants more heavily when they are not confident in the accuracy of their memories than when they are internally confident in the accuracy of their memories.<ref name=Walther />\n\n===Social anxiety===\n\nResearchers report [[social anxiety]] as having two significant components: fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. It has been suggested that people with a fear of negative evaluation are more likely to be influenced by their peers, while those with a tendency for social avoidance are less likely to be influenced by their peers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = D.B. | last2 = London | first2 = K | last3 = Waechter | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Social anxiety moderates memory conformity in adolescents | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 1034\u20131045 | doi=10.1002/acp.1604}}</ref> The individuals concerned with negative evaluation are more likely to comply, as disagreeing with their peers is seen as having a higher cost than the cost of being wrong.

Post-event information comes in three basic types, the first of which is due to the impact that a biased or [[leading question]] can have on altering an eyewitness's memory of the event.<ref name=\"Loftus 1975\">{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth F|title=Leading questions and the eyewitness report|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1975|volume=7|issue=4|pages=560\u2013572|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90023-7}}</ref> The second type occurs when the eyewitness is retold the events that they witnessed.<ref name=\"Wright and Stroud\">{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Daniel B.|author2=Stroud, Joanne N.|title=Memory quality and misinformation for peripheral and central objects|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=273\u2013286|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8333.1998.tb00366.x}}</ref> False information included within the retelling is often incorporated into the eyewitness's memories, thus altering their perception of the events that occurred. The third type of post-event information originates from conversations with others.  Recent research has shown that there is a critical period for eyewitnesses that occurs before they get to report their side of the story.<ref name=\"Schwartz and Wright\">{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Shari L.|author2=Wright, Daniel B.|title=Memory Conformity for New and Old Items with Immediate and Delayed Testing|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|volume=26|issue=4|pages=508\u2013515|doi=10.1002/acp.2820}}</ref>  During this time, they are most susceptible to outside influences contaminating their version of the events.\n\nThe effects of witness discussion on memory are even more enhanced when the witnesses know each other well. People are more likely to believe information, regardless of whether it is true or false, when it comes from someone they know\u2014say, a friend or significant other.<ref name=\"Gabbert Court Review2\"/>  Such a person could be viewed with more credibility than a stranger for a variety of reasons, including a greater trust and familiarity in the relationship.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite journal|last=French|first=Lauren|author2=Garry, Maryanne|author3=Mori, Kazuo|year=2008|title=You say tomato?

Interaction with other people changes the pool of information that one has about an event and can sway one's thoughts on how the event actually unfolded.<ref name=Wright />  This suggestibility seems to be the most common way in which post-event information distortion occurs in a legal setting because often, witnesses cannot be prevented from talking to one another. That said, there are multiple factors that affect the potential for suggestibility in a witness. More accurate memories are also less susceptible to memory conformity than less accurate ones.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\" />  This finding is important for legal situations because it may be logically deduced that a witness with a more accurate memory of the event in question will be less likely to change his or her story after discussing it with other witnesses, and someone with a less accurate recollection could be more prone to conform.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\" />\n\n===Everyday implications===\nFalse [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]] can also occur over time.

Memory conformity was introduced by having participant and confederate pairs study words and then complete a social recognition test where they took turns to make judgements to the same items. When the participants responded after the confederate, they tended to conform to confederate's judgements regardless of whether the confederate had made a correct or incorrect response. IS was measured using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale 2. This scale allows separate measures of Yield, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to altering their memory reports of events as a result of leading questions, and Shift, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to changing responses to questions when placed under pressure to do so. Only Yield was a significant predictor of memory conformity.\nSocial contamination of false memory can be exemplified in prominent in situations involving social interactions, such as [[eyewitness testimony]].<ref name=\"Valentine\">{{cite journal|last=Valentine|first=Tim|author2=Maras, Katie|year=2011|title=The effect of cross-examination on the accuracy of adult eyewitness testimony|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=554\u2013561|doi=10.1002/acp.1768}}</ref><ref name=Gabbert /><ref name=Luus /> Research on memory conformity has revealed that such [[suggestibility]] and errors with source monitoring has far reaching consequences, with important legal and social implications.

The witnesses discussed the scene with each other while in the room, contrary to what they were told to do. The specific descriptions the witnesses gave about the perpetrator upon leaving the room were influenced by each other, causing the police to collect false information about the perpetrator while initially searching for him or her. The perpetrator, [[Mijailo Mijailovic]], was caught on camera and did not match the descriptions that the eyewitnesses gave.

These sources tend to be one's own experience with others and the world, or their own imagination and dreams. Specific and vivid details within each of these helps determine which of the possibilities is the most probable source. For one\u2019s outer experience, these details usually involve the setting and events that occurred around that time. These are then contrasted with other events that have occurred in the past to judge what the source could have been. Personal, concrete experiences are often more vivid and have more detail than imagined experiences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampinen|first=James Michael|title=Memory 101|last2=Beike|first2=Denise R.|date=November 2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-0924-8|location=New York, NY|doi=10.1891/9780826109255}}</ref> Noticing the difference between details and vivid details can help to determine whether a piece of information came from experience or the imagination.\n\nSource monitoring has a relationship with the frontal lobe of the brain, which is the region of the brain that uses judgment to make decisions. The hippocampal region of the brain, involved with memory, is highly used when retrieving information from external events.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hallucinations in psychoses and affective disorders : a clinical and biological approach|others=Brambilla, Paolo,, Mauri, Massimo Carlo,, Altamura, Alfredo Carlo|isbn=978-3-319-75124-5|location=Cham|oclc=1052566803}}</ref> After having recalled a memory or piece of information with the help of the hippocampus, the brain uses its judgment abilities within the prefrontal cortex to determine whether it was received by a specific source or another.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brainerd, Charles J.|title=The science of false memory|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Reyna, Valerie F., 1955-|isbn=978-0-19-803504-6|location=New York|oclc=61341505}}</ref>\n\n'''Source monitoring errors''' is another mechanism underlying memory conformity.

There are not enough differences to permit a strong enough distinction between the two. This can lead to false attributions when working in relation to sources.

Some photos contained images of an accomplice, while others did not. Immediately after seeing these photographs, participants were asked about the presence of an accomplice in the photographs, as well as their level of confidence in their reports. Initial reports were highly accurate, but after being placed in pairs where each person had seen a slightly different photograph, this pattern changed. Seventy-five percent of the pairs exhibited memory conformity, with one half of the dyad conforming to the other. In almost every case, the less confident person in the pair accepted the more confident person's memory as the correct one.<ref name=Wright />\n\nInternal confidence at the time of memory encoding also affects general social confidence levels. An individual's reliance on another person's memory is constantly changing as the initial encoder takes into account the conditions under which he/she first perceived the event, as well as the conditions (or believed conditions) under which another individual perceived that event.<ref name=\"Allan and Midjord\" /> One study showed that levels of memory conformity between individuals varied based on confidence in the comparative quality of initial viewing conditions. Study participants who thought that they had had less time to view a scene than did another individual were much more likely to conform to that individual's report of an event, while participants who believed their initial viewing window to be longer were less likely to conform.<ref name=\"Allan and Midjord\">{{cite journal|last=Allan|first=Kevin|author2=Midjord, J.

The presence of dissenters works to decrease the overall group certainty and group unity, which decreases social conformity among group members, thus increasing individual internal reliance.<ref name=Walther/> Research suggests that the clarity of a participant's recollection of a memory plays a role in within-group recollection: as clarity and internal confidence increase, the pressure to conform to the group decreases. The same research goes on to show that false reports from confederates within a group influence participants more heavily when they are not confident in the accuracy of their memories than when they are internally confident in the accuracy of their memories.<ref name=Walther />\n\n===Social anxiety===\n\nResearchers report [[social anxiety]] as having two significant components: fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. It has been suggested that people with a fear of negative evaluation are more likely to be influenced by their peers, while those with a tendency for social avoidance are less likely to be influenced by their peers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = D.B. | last2 = London | first2 = K | last3 = Waechter | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Social anxiety moderates memory conformity in adolescents | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 1034\u20131045 | doi=10.1002/acp.1604}}</ref> The individuals concerned with negative evaluation are more likely to comply, as disagreeing with their peers is seen as having a higher cost than the cost of being wrong. Individuals with high levels of social avoidance, on the other hand, place less value on the information provided by others, and are less likely to pay attention to it, resulting in a lower level of conformity.<ref name=\"Wright and Kamala\" />\n\n=== Relationships ===\nResearch has also shown that the strength of a relationship between individuals can affect their levels of conformity. Studies exploring levels of conformity between acquaintances and friends, and between strangers and romantic partners show that pairs of individuals with stronger relationships are more susceptible to memory conformity.<ref name=\"Gabbert Court Review2\"/>\n\n=== Source Credibility ===\n'''Source credibility''' involves the judgment of a source's believability based on various characteristics, such as the level of expertise and the trustworthiness of what has been presented.

R., Rattner, A., & Sagarina, E. (1996). ''Convicted but innocent: Wrongful conviction and public policy.''  London: Sage.</ref>  Eyewitnesses can encounter post-event information after witnessing a crime.  Post-event information comes in three basic types, the first of which is due to the impact that a biased or [[leading question]] can have on altering an eyewitness's memory of the event.<ref name=\"Loftus 1975\">{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth F|title=Leading questions and the eyewitness report|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1975|volume=7|issue=4|pages=560\u2013572|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90023-7}}</ref> The second type occurs when the eyewitness is retold the events that they witnessed.<ref name=\"Wright and Stroud\">{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Daniel B.|author2=Stroud, Joanne N.|title=Memory quality and misinformation for peripheral and central objects|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=273\u2013286|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8333.1998.tb00366.x}}</ref> False information included within the retelling is often incorporated into the eyewitness's memories, thus altering their perception of the events that occurred. The third type of post-event information originates from conversations with others.  Recent research has shown that there is a critical period for eyewitnesses that occurs before they get to report their side of the story.<ref name=\"Schwartz and Wright\">{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Shari L.|author2=Wright, Daniel B.|title=Memory Conformity for New and Old Items with Immediate and Delayed Testing|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|volume=26|issue=4|pages=508\u2013515|doi=10.1002/acp.2820}}</ref>  During this time, they are most susceptible to outside influences contaminating their version of the events.\n\nThe effects of witness discussion on memory are even more enhanced when the witnesses know each other well. People are more likely to believe information, regardless of whether it is true or false, when it comes from someone they know\u2014say, a friend or significant other.<ref name=\"Gabbert Court Review2\"/>  Such a person could be viewed with more credibility than a stranger for a variety of reasons, including a greater trust and familiarity in the relationship.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite journal|last=French|first=Lauren|author2=Garry, Maryanne|author3=Mori, Kazuo|year=2008|title=You say tomato?

Studies have shown that when participants were asked to discuss their memories of a violent crime video in terms of their emotions, they had higher levels of subjectivity and major errors in free recall.<ref name=Marsh>{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=Elizabeth J.|author2=Tversky, Barbara |author3=Hutson, Michael |title=How eyewitnesses talk about events: implications for memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=531\u2013544|doi=10.1002/acp.1095}}</ref>\n\nOne of [[The Seven Sins of Memory|the seven sins of memory]] is suggestibility. Interaction with other people changes the pool of information that one has about an event and can sway one's thoughts on how the event actually unfolded.<ref name=Wright />  This suggestibility seems to be the most common way in which post-event information distortion occurs in a legal setting because often, witnesses cannot be prevented from talking to one another. That said, there are multiple factors that affect the potential for suggestibility in a witness. More accurate memories are also less susceptible to memory conformity than less accurate ones.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\" />  This finding is important for legal situations because it may be logically deduced that a witness with a more accurate memory of the event in question will be less likely to change his or her story after discussing it with other witnesses, and someone with a less accurate recollection could be more prone to conform.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\" />\n\n===Everyday implications===\nFalse [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]] can also occur over time.  In a recent study, 43% of subjects remembered a childhood event that they never actually experienced.<ref name=\"Wade, K. 2005\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wade | first1 = K. | last2 = Garry | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Strategies for verifying false autobiographical memories | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychology | volume = 118 | issue = 4| pages = 587\u2013602 | pmid = 16402747 }}</ref>  These naturally occurring autobiographical memories can span a large temporal range, from recent events to childhood memories.  These memories also contain weak perceptual detail, which makes them similar to real childhood memories and thus more believable to the person.<ref name=\"Wade, K. 2005\"/>\n\nFirst-born children are also more likely than their later-born siblings to dominate a discussion and encounter conformity errors.<ref name=Becker>{{cite journal|last=Becker|first=Selwyn W.|author2=Lerner, Melvin J. |author3=Carroll, Jean |title=Conformity as a function of birth order and type of group pressure: A verification|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1966|volume=3|issue=2|pages=242\u2013244|doi=10.1037/h0022894|pmid=5903534}}</ref> In one study, later-born children were more influenced if they had reason to believe that the information given to them was more valid then the information they themselves possessed.  First-born children were relatively unaffected by informational value and were more influenced by their motivation to either go along with or to resist the expectations of the majority.<ref name=\"Becker\"/>\n\nDiscussion of memory conformity is also particularly relevant in today's age of mass advertisement. Research suggests that our predisposition to trust the judgment of a group can be affected by political campaigns and advertising, and even work to alter personal beliefs.<ref name=\"Edelson and sharot\">{{cite journal|last=Edelson|first=M.|author2=Sharot, T. |author3=Dolan, R.
