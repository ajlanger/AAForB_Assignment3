It is named in honor of [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]], widely considered to be the greatest player in college football. A radioactive [[metal]], lawrencium is the eleventh [[transuranic element]] and is also the final member of the [[actinide]] series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in [[particle accelerator]]s by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Thirteen [[isotopes of lawrencium]] are currently known; the most stable is <sup>266</sup>Lr with a [[half-life]] of 11&nbsp;hours, but the shorter-lived <sup>260</sup>Lr (half-life 2.7&nbsp;minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.\n\nChemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]] to [[lutetium]] in the [[periodic table]], and is a [[valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] element. It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th-period [[transition metal]]s: however, its [[electron configuration]] is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an [[atomic orbital|s<sup>2</sup>p]] configuration instead of the s<sup>2</sup>d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of [[lead]].\n\nIn the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[transfermium wars|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and while the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) initially established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element's name.\n\n==History==\n[[File:96904536.thumb3.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ghiorso]] updating the periodic table in April 1961, inscribing the symbol \"Lw\" in the position for element 103, as codiscoverers Latimer, Sikkeland, and Larsh (left to right) look on approvingly.]]\nIn 1958, scientists at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] claimed the discovery of element 102, now called [[nobelium]]. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same [[curium]] target used with [[nitrogen]]-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with [[decay energy]] around {{val|9|1|u=[[electronvolt|MeV]]}} and half-life around {{frac|1|4}}&nbsp;s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for <sup>257</sup>Lr ([[alpha decay]] [[decay energy|energy]] 8.87&nbsp;MeV, half-life 0.6&nbsp;s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of the strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103.<ref name = \"emsley2011\">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks|date=2011}}</ref><ref name=\"93TWG\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961.

Scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]) raised several criticisms: all but one were answered adequately. The exception was that <sup>252</sup>Cf was the most common isotope in the target, and in the reactions with <sup>10</sup>B, <sup>258</sup>Lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons, and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five. This would lead to a narrow yield curve, not the broad one reported by the Berkeley team.

In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[nobelium]], to the left of the 6d transition metal [[rutherfordium]], and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties.

Seaborg]], who devised the actinide concept that elements [[actinium|89]] to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements [[lanthanum|57]] to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member and that the Lr<sup>3+</sup> ion should be about as stable as Lu<sup>3+</sup> in [[aqueous solution]]. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.<ref name=Silva16447>Silva, pp. 1644\u20137</ref>\n\n1969 studies on the element showed that lawrencium reacted with [[chlorine]] to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl<sub>3</sub>. Its [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] was found to be similar to that of the chlorides of [[curium]], [[fermium]], and [[nobelium]] and much less than that of [[rutherfordium]] chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500&nbsp;atoms of the isotope <sup>256</sup>Lr, comparing it with divalent ([[nobelium|No]], [[barium|Ba]], [[radium|Ra]]), trivalent ([[fermium|Fm]], [[californium|Cf]], [[curium|Cm]], [[americium|Am]], [[actinium|Ac]]), and tetravalent ([[thorium|Th]], [[plutonium|Pu]]) elements. It was found that lawrencium [[extraction (chemistry)|coextracted]] with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the <sup>256</sup>Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it [[elution|eluted]] ahead of [[mendelevium|Md<sup>3+</sup>]] in the elution sequence.<ref name=Silva16447/> Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr<sup>3+</sup> ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium(III) [[fluoride]] (LrF<sub>3</sub>) and [[hydroxide]] (Lr(OH)<sub>3</sub>) should both be insoluble in water.<ref name=Silva16447/> Due to the [[lanthanide contraction|actinide contraction]], the [[ionic radius]] of Lr<sup>3+</sup> should be smaller than that of Md<sup>3+</sup>, and it should elute ahead of Md<sup>3+</sup> when [[ammonium \u03b1-hydroxyisobutyrate]] (ammonium \u03b1-HIB) is used as an eluant.<ref name=Silva16447/> Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope <sup>260</sup>Lr confirmed lawrencium's trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as [[erbium]], and found that lawrencium's ionic radius was {{val|88.6|0.3|u=[[picometer|pm]]}}, larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from [[periodic trend]]s.<ref name=Silva16447/> Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to {{val|88.1|0.1|u=pm}} and calculated an [[enthalpy of hydration]] value of {{val|\u22123685|13|u=kJ/mol}}.<ref name=Silva16447/> It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.<ref name=Silva16447/>\n\nIt has been speculated that the 7s electrons are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr<sup>+</sup> ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr<sup>3+</sup> to Lr<sup>2+</sup> or Lr<sup>+</sup> in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the [[standard electrode potential]] of the ''E''\u00b0(Lr<sup>3+</sup>\u2192Lr<sup>+</sup>) couple was calculated to be less than \u22121.56&nbsp;[[volt|V]], indicating that the existence of Lr<sup>+</sup> ions in aqueous solution was unlikely.

It is named in honor of [Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]], widely considered to be the greatest player in college football. A radioactive [[metal]], lawrencium is the eleventh [[transuranic element]] and is also the final member of the [[actinide]] series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in [[particle accelerator]]s by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Thirteen [[isotopes of lawrencium]] are currently known; the most stable is <sup>266</sup>Lr with a [[half-life]] of 11&nbsp;hours, but the shorter-lived <sup>260</sup>Lr (half-life 2.7&nbsp;minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.\n\nChemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]] to [[lutetium]] in the [[periodic table]], and is a [[valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] element. It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th-period [[transition metal]]s: however, its [[electron configuration]] is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an [[atomic orbital|s<sup>2</sup>p]] configuration instead of the s<sup>2</sup>d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of [[lead]].\n\nIn the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[transfermium wars|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and while the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) initially established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element's name.\n\n==History==\n[[File:96904536.thumb3.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ghiorso]] updating the periodic table in April 1961, inscribing the symbol \"Lw\" in the position for element 103, as codiscoverers Latimer, Sikkeland, and Larsh (left to right) look on approvingly.]]\nIn 1958, scientists at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] claimed the discovery of element 102, now called [[nobelium]]. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same [[curium]] target used with [[nitrogen]]-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with [[decay energy]] around {{val|9|1|u=[[electronvolt|MeV]]}} and half-life around {{frac|1|4}}&nbsp;s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for <sup>257</sup>Lr ([[alpha decay]] [[decay energy|energy]] 8.87&nbsp;MeV, half-life 0.6&nbsp;s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of the strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103.<ref name = \"emsley2011\">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks|date=2011}}</ref><ref name=\"93TWG\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

Seaborg]], who devised the actinide concept that elements [[actinium|89]] to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements [[lanthanum|57]] to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member and that the Lr<sup>3+</sup> ion should be about as stable as Lu<sup>3+</sup> in [[aqueous solution]]. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.<ref name=Silva16447>Silva, pp. 1644\u20137</ref>\n\n1969 studies on the element showed that lawrencium reacted with [[chlorine]] to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl<sub>3</sub>. Its [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] was found to be similar to that of the chlorides of [[curium]], [[fermium]], and [[nobelium]] and much less than that of [[rutherfordium]] chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500&nbsp;atoms of the isotope <sup>256</sup>Lr, comparing it with divalent ([[nobelium|No]], [[barium|Ba]], [[radium|Ra]]), trivalent ([[fermium|Fm]], [[californium|Cf]], [[curium|Cm]], [[americium|Am]], [[actinium|Ac]]), and tetravalent ([[thorium|Th]], [[plutonium|Pu]]) elements. It was found that lawrencium [[extraction (chemistry)|coextracted]] with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the <sup>256</sup>Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it [[elution|eluted]] ahead of [[mendelevium|Md<sup>3+</sup>]] in the elution sequence.<ref name=Silva16447/> Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr<sup>3+</sup> ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium(III) [[fluoride]] (LrF<sub>3</sub>) and [[hydroxide]] (Lr(OH)<sub>3</sub>) should both be insoluble in water.<ref name=Silva16447/> Due to the [[lanthanide contraction|actinide contraction]], the [[ionic radius]] of Lr<sup>3+</sup> should be smaller than that of Md<sup>3+</sup>, and it should elute ahead of Md<sup>3+</sup> when [[ammonium \u03b1-hydroxyisobutyrate]] (ammonium \u03b1-HIB) is used as an eluant.<ref name=Silva16447/> Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope <sup>260</sup>Lr confirmed lawrencium's trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as [[erbium]], and found that lawrencium's ionic radius was {{val|88.6|0.3|u=[[picometer|pm]]}}, larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from [[periodic trend]]s.<ref name=Silva16447/> Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to {{val|88.1|0.1|u=pm}} and calculated an [[enthalpy of hydration]] value of {{val|\u22123685|13|u=kJ/mol}}.<ref name=Silva16447/> It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.<ref name=Silva16447/>\n\nIt has been speculated that the 7s electrons are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr<sup>+</sup> ion.

Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different [[pH]] ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus <sup>256</sup>Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24&nbsp;MeV alpha particles.<ref name=Silva16423/> More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with \u03b1-HIB to take place in enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope <sup>260</sup>Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05&nbsp;M&nbsp;[[hydrochloric acid]].<ref name=Silva16423/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Subject bar\n|portal=Chemistry\n|book1=Lawrencium\n|book2=Actinides\n|book3=Period 7 elements\n|book4=Group 3 elements\n|book5=Chemical elements (sorted&nbsp;alphabetically)\n|book6=Chemical elements (sorted by number)\n|commons=y\n|wikt=y\n|wikt-search=lawrencium\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0211-0_13|title=The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements|date=2011|isbn=978-94-007-0210-3|publisher=Springer |place=Netherlands|author=Silva, Robert J.|editor= Morss, Lester R.|editor2= Edelstein, Norman M.|editor3= Fuger, Jean |chapter=Chapter 13.
