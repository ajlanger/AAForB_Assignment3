Since then there are 104 seats in the National Assembly (96 elected, 8 appointed), and 42 seats in the National Council (3 from each region, with the number of regions increased to 14).<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Women and political participation in Namibia and Nigeria: a comparative analysis of women in elective positions | first1=Maryam Omolara| last1=Quadri | first2=Erika K | last2=Thomas | journal=Journal for Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences | publisher=[[University of Namibia]] | volume=7 | issue=2 | date=2018 | issn=2026-7215 | pages=6\u20139 | url=http://repository.unam.edu.na/bitstream/handle/11070/2426/quadri_women_2018.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Judicial branch===\n{{main|Judicial system of Namibia}}\n\nThe highest [[judiciary|judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Namibia|Supreme Court]], whose judges are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission. The judicial structure in Namibia parallels that of South Africa. In 1919, [[Roman-Dutch law]] was declared the common law of the territory and remains so to the present.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{Elect|List of political parties in Namibia|Elections in Namibia}}\n\nElections were held in 1992, to elect members of 13 newly established Regional Councils, as well as new municipal officials. Two members from each Regional Council serve simultaneously as members of the National Council, the country's second house of Parliament. Nineteen of its members are from the ruling [[SWAPO]] party, and seven are from the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia|Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] (DTA). In December 1994, elections were held for the President and the [[National Assembly of Namibia|National Assembly]].\n\nNamibia has about 40 political groups, ranging from modern political parties to traditional groups based on tribal authority. Some represent single tribes or ethnic groups while others encompass several. Most participate in political alliances, some of which are multiracial, with frequently shifting membership.\n\n[[SWAPO]] is the ruling party, and all but one of the new government's first cabinet posts went to SWAPO members. A [[marxist]]-oriented movement, SWAPO has become more right wing and now espouses the need for a mixed economy. SWAPO has been a legal political party since its formation and was cautiously active in Namibia, although before implementation of the UN Plan, it was forbidden to hold meetings of more than 20 people, and its leadership was subject to frequent detention. In December 1976, the [[UN General Assembly]] recognised SWAPO as \"the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people,\" a characterisation other internal parties did not accept.\n\nIn the 1999 presidential and parliamentary elections, SWAPO continued its history of political dominance, taking 55 of the 72 Assembly seats, and returning President [[Sam Nujoma]] to the office for his third term. The principal opposition parties are the [[Congress of Democrats]] (CoD) and the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] (DTA), with each possessing seven seats in the [[National Assembly of Namibia|National Assembly]].\n\nIn 2019 Hage Geingob won the presidential election and received a second term as president. His percentage of votes gained, however, dropped significantly from 87% in 2014 to 56% in 2019. While rural areas predominantly supported Geingob, many urban centres voted for the independent candidate, Panduleni Itula, who received 29% of the overall votes. No other candidate achieved a two-digit result. SWAPO, yet again, won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, but closely missed the threshold for a two-thirds majority, which it held since 1994. Consequently, opposition parties also gained seats, most prominently the PDM, which obtained 16 seats in the National Assembly.<ref name=reduced>{{cite news | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/86045/read/Reduced-victory--Swapo-Geingob-drop-votes | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | title = Reduced victory ...

The judicial structure in Namibia parallels that of South Africa. In 1919, [[Roman-Dutch law]] was declared the common law of the territory and remains so to the present.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{Elect|List of political parties in Namibia|Elections in Namibia}}\n\nElections were held in 1992, to elect members of 13 newly established Regional Councils, as well as new municipal officials. Two members from each Regional Council serve simultaneously as members of the National Council, the country's second house of Parliament. Nineteen of its members are from the ruling [[SWAPO]] party, and seven are from the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia|Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] (DTA). In December 1994, elections were held for the President and the [[National Assembly of Namibia|National Assembly]].\n\nNamibia has about 40 political groups, ranging from modern political parties to traditional groups based on tribal authority. Some represent single tribes or ethnic groups while others encompass several. Most participate in political alliances, some of which are multiracial, with frequently shifting membership.\n\n[[SWAPO]] is the ruling party, and all but one of the new government's first cabinet posts went to SWAPO members. A [[marxist]]-oriented movement, SWAPO has become more right wing and now espouses the need for a mixed economy. SWAPO has been a legal political party since its formation and was cautiously active in Namibia, although before implementation of the UN Plan, it was forbidden to hold meetings of more than 20 people, and its leadership was subject to frequent detention. In December 1976, the [[UN General Assembly]] recognised SWAPO as \"the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people,\" a characterisation other internal parties did not accept.\n\nIn the 1999 presidential and parliamentary elections, SWAPO continued its history of political dominance, taking 55 of the 72 Assembly seats, and returning President [[Sam Nujoma]] to the office for his third term. The principal opposition parties are the [[Congress of Democrats]] (CoD) and the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] (DTA), with each possessing seven seats in the [[National Assembly of Namibia|National Assembly]].\n\nIn 2019 Hage Geingob won the presidential election and received a second term as president. His percentage of votes gained, however, dropped significantly from 87% in 2014 to 56% in 2019. While rural areas predominantly supported Geingob, many urban centres voted for the independent candidate, Panduleni Itula, who received 29% of the overall votes. No other candidate achieved a two-digit result. SWAPO, yet again, won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, but closely missed the threshold for a two-thirds majority, which it held since 1994. Consequently, opposition parties also gained seats, most prominently the PDM, which obtained 16 seats in the National Assembly.<ref name=reduced>{{cite news | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/86045/read/Reduced-victory--Swapo-Geingob-drop-votes | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | title = Reduced victory ...

These institutions are based on ethnicity and headed by the [[traditional leader]] of that ethnic group or clan. These positions are not paid by the state. Instead the traditional group's members are expected to sustain their leadership. Government did, however, give one car each to the recognised authorities, and awards allowances for fuel and administrative work.
