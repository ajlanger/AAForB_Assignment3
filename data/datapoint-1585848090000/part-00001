The first lineup of the band also featured Lazar Male\u0161evi\u0107 (bass guitar) and Sini\u0161a Lu\u010di\u0107 (drums). In the beginning, the band had several lineup changes, before the first consistent lineup was formed. It featured Mumin, Medan, Vladimir Jovanov (also known as Menadner Protector, a former Necrophobic member, bass guitar), Mario Kalin (guitar), and Robert Radi\u0107 (a former [[Kontraritam]], [[La Strada (band)|La Strada]] and [[Obojeni Program]] member, drums).\n\nInitially, the band was [[punk blues]]-oriented. As the band's songs featured [[English language]] lyrics, and as their first releases were released through [[independent record label]]s, the band initially did not manage to break through mainstream media. They released their debut [[audio cassette]] entitled ''There no Centuries'' in 1988 through Mr Montenegro Records. In 1993, they released their second album ''Everclassic'' through Music Yuser,<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Everclassic/release/1185055 ''Everclassic'' at Discogs]</ref> and, in 1995, ''Oh, Evolution'' through the same record label.
