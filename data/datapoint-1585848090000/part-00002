Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to [[Nishapur]] to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under [[Muhammad Hasib]].<ref name=\"HistMuslimPhil\">Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. \"Nasir al-Din Tusi\".

He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"<ref name=\"NEp44\">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"<ref name=\"NEp44\" />\n\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45f.</ref>}}\n\nThus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\n\nTusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M.

Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith.

This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student ''Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari'' <ref name=\"Shams\"/> was the teacher of [[Byzantine]] scholar ''[[Gregory Choniades]],'' <ref name=\"Chioniadis\">{{MathGenealogy|id=201288}}</ref> who had in turn trained [[astronomer]] ''[[Manuel Bryennios]]'' <ref name=\"Bryennios\">{{MathGenealogy|id=184632}}</ref> about 1300 in [[Constantinople]].\n\nFor his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a [[Tusi-couple]], which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace [[Ptolemy]]'s problematic [[equant]]<ref>Craig G.

Although it doesn't mean that he was a supporter of mobility of the earth, as he and his 16th-century commentator [[al-Birjandi|al-B\u012brjand\u012b]], maintained that the earth's immobility could be demonstrated, only by physical principles found in natural philosophy.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ragep | first = F.

He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"<ref name=\"NEp44\">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"<ref name=\"NEp44\" />\n\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45f.</ref>}}\n\nThus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\n\nTusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M.
