It was also another learning institution. Every Lawm has a ''Lawm-upa'' (a senior member), a ''To\u2019llai-pao'' (an overseer or superintendent) and a ''Lawm-tangvo'' (assistant superintendent). Besides being a source of traditional learning, the institution of the Lawm also facilitated the transmission of both technical as well as practical knowledge to its members, especially with regard to particular methods of [[farming]], [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and sporting activities such as ''Kung\u2013Kal'' (high jump, especially over a choice ''mithun''), ''Ka\u2019ng Ka\u2019p'', ''Ka\u2019ngchoi Ka\u2019p'' (top game), ''Suhtumkhawh'' (javelin throw using the heavy wooden implement for pounding-de-husking-paddy) and ''So\u2019ngse'' (shot put).<ref name=\"Paokhohao Haokp 2013\"/>\n\nThe Lawm was also a centre where young Kuki people learned discipline and social etiquette. After harvest season, the ''Lawm meet'' is celebrated with a ''Lawm-se\u2019l'' and, as a commemoration, a pillar is erected. The event is accompanied by dance and drinking rice-beer, which sometimes continues for days and nights.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Laws and government==\n\n===Governance===\nWith regard to governance, Semang (cabinet) is the annual assembly of a Kuki village community held at the Chief's residence represents the Inpi (Assembly).
