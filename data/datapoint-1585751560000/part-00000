The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[donald trump\n''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text''''''Bold text'''''''''''''''''''''''' Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices.

2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This ambition was evident in many of the season's costumes. Tree was experimental; Toybina and her team challenged themselves to question \"what fabric can do\" by creating something new and different. Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's triple tail coat was [[samurai]]-like and had its mask [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to than stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design, and rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design and created a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while the Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and included a top hat made of foam. In the case of the Egg, the costume was requested by a contestant. The end result, which was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]],\" incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina says.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, Toybina had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask so as to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume in order to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears.

series, part of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise, featuring celebrities in head-to-toe costumes and face masks which conceal their identities from other contestants, panelists, and an audience. The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices. The panelists are given time to speculate the identity of the singer after the performance, including the opportunity to ask questions or gain additional clues offered by the host.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\"/>\n\n===Panelists and host===\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 420\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = Robin Thicke 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2   = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3   = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4   = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4 = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5   = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, it was confirmed by Fox that the judging panel would consist of singer-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]].

2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This ambition was evident in many of the season's costumes. Tree was experimental; Toybina and her team challenged themselves to question \"what fabric can do\" by creating something new and different. Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's triple tail coat was [[samurai]]-like and had its mask [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to than stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design, and rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design and created a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while the Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and included a top hat made of foam. In the case of the Egg, the costume was requested by a contestant. The end result, which was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]],\" incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina says.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, Toybina had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask so as to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume in order to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.
