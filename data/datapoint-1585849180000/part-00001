The Psalm chosen in such a context is often called the '''responsorial psalm'''.  Although often associated with the [[Roman Catholic]] church, it is used more widely, including in [[Anglican]], [[Episcopalian]] and [[Lutheran]] traditions.\n\nThe \"responsorial\" aspect is used in two related but different ways: the liturgical position of the psalm as a 'response' to the first ([[Old Testament]]) reading, and one possible manner of reciting it.  The [[RSCM]] summarises these two aspects: \"It is responsorial because it is sung in response to the first reading, not because it has a refrain or response for the people to sing. The whole psalm is therefore the response.\"<ref name=\"rscm\">{{cite book | title=Music for Common Worship III |page=77 |publisher=RSCM |isbn=0854021027 |year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==Liturgical position==\nThe Catholic Dictionary defines the responsorial psalm as:\n{{quote\n|text=Antiphonal psalm that is said or read before the Gospel at Mass.

After the second reading and before the Gospel the Alleluia is either sung or read, followed by its appropriate verse. If the Alleluia or the verse before the Gospel is not sung, it may be omitted.
