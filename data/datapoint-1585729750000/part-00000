According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nSanta Cruz is situated on the banks of the [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] which flows into the eastern part of [[Laguna de Bay]]. The town is bounded by the Bay on the north, by Lumban and Pagsanjan towns in the east, Pagsanjan and Magdalena towns in the south, and Pila in the west. It is {{convert|88|km}} from Manila via Calamba and Los Ba\u00f1os. It is accessible by land from Metro Manila passing through [[Rizal Province]] via [[Manila East Road]] or via [[South Luzon Expressway]]\n\nSanta Cruz is considered as the service and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. The town is composed of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. Although relatively far from the immediate urbanizing influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz continues to progress. It is now classified as first class municipality. The present administration is headed by the Mayor Egay San Luis. Santa Cruz is also the seat of the provincial government since 1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. Boosting the economy of the municipality are the incipient and fast-growing agribusiness industries such as livestock raising, horticulture and aquaculture. The town is composed of twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are being classified as urban.\n\nThe development of Santa Cruz as the administrative, commercial, and service center of Laguna makes it accessible for all private/public vehicles going to nearby places particularly [[Pagsanjan, Laguna|Pagsanjan]], [[Lake Caliraya]], [[Liliw, Laguna|Liliw]], [[Paete, Laguna|Paete]] and [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the last decade of the 16th century, Santa Cruz was once a well populated barrio of the present municipality of [[Lumban]], as well as other contemporary towns like [[Pagsanjan]], [[Cavinti]], [[Paete]] and [[Pangil]]. On June 4, 1602, Santa Cruz separated from Lumban and became a pueblo with its church and local government.\n\nSince its foundation in 1602, the town had been ravaged by calamitous forces such as fires, typhoons, floods and human vandalism during the Philippine Revolution of 1896\u20131899, the war of the Philippine Independence (1899\u20131902), [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Battle of Santa Cruz]], the assault of the Tulisanes (bandits) during the Spanish times. The Filipino troops of the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas also came from the town and was involved in the Second Battle of Santa Cruz on January 26, 1945. \n\nCharacterized by fertile flat lands situated along the coastal plains of Laguna de Bay, the economic base of the town had been traditionally anchored on two primary industries, namely agriculture and fishing which still remain up to the present. In view of the strategic location of Santa Cruz relative to the other coastal settlements about the lake, trading activities have likewise rooted on the town during those early settlement days. The town proper which has always been the focal point of activities used to be accessible to the other lake-shore areas due to the navigable [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] aside from the [[Laguna de Bay]] itself. Since those early days, water is the principal mode of transportation.\n\nToday, Santa Cruz serves as the capital of Laguna and is considered as the business and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pila & Sta Cruz Laguna.JPG|thumb|Aerial view with Santa Cruz in the centre and [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the foreground]]\nSituated at the central portion of Laguna province along the south-eastern coast of Laguna de Bay, Santa Cruz lies {{convert|87|km}} southeast of Metro Manila via Calamba and is geographically located at approximately 14 degrees 17' latitude and 121 degrees 25' longitude.

The town is bounded by the Bay on the north, by Lumban and Pagsanjan towns in the east, Pagsanjan and Magdalena towns in the south, and Pila in the west. It is {{convert|88|km}} from Manila via Calamba and Los Ba\u00f1os. It is accessible by land from From Metro Manila Passing Through [[Rizal Province]] Via [[Manila East Road]] or Via [[South Luzon Expressway]]\n\nSanta Cruz is considered as the service and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. The town is composed of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. Although relatively far from the immediate urbanizing influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz continues to progress. It is now classified as first class municipality. The present administration is headed by the Mayor Egay San Luis. Santa Cruz is also the seat of the provincial government since 1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. Boosting the economy of the municipality are the incipient and fast-growing agribusiness industries such as livestock raising, horticulture and aquaculture. The town is composed of twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are being classified as urban.\n\nThe development of Santa Cruz as the administrative, commercial, and service center of Laguna makes it accessible for all private/public vehicles going to nearby places particularly [[Pagsanjan, Laguna|Pagsanjan]], [[Lake Caliraya]], [[Liliw, Laguna|Liliw]], [[Paete, Laguna|Paete]] and [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the last decade of the 16th century, Santa Cruz was once a well populated barrio of the present municipality of [[Lumban]], as well as other contemporary towns like [[Pagsanjan]], [[Cavinti]], [[Paete]] and [[Pangil]]. On June 4, 1602, Santa Cruz separated from Lumban and became a pueblo with its church and local government.\n\nSince its foundation in 1602, the town had been ravaged by calamitous forces such as fires, typhoons, floods and human vandalism during the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1899, the war of the Philippine Independence (1899\u20131902), [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Battle of Santa Cruz]], the assault of the Tulisanes (bandits) during the Spanish times. The Filipino troops of the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas also came from the town and was involved in the Second Battle of Santa Cruz on January 26, 1945. \n\nCharacterized by fertile flat lands situated along the coastal plains of Laguna de Bay, the economic base of the town had been traditionally anchored on two primary industries, namely agriculture and fishing which still remain up to the present. In view of the strategic location of Santa Cruz relative to the other coastal settlements about the lake, trading activities have likewise rooted on the town during those early settlement days. The town proper which has always been the focal point of activities used to be accessible to the other lake-shore areas due to the navigable [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] aside from the [[Laguna de Bay]] itself. Since those early days, water is the principal mode of transportation.\n\nToday, Santa Cruz serves as the capital of Laguna and is considered as the business and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pila & Sta Cruz Laguna.JPG|thumb|Aerial view with Santa Cruz in the centre and [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the foreground]]\nSituated at the central portion of Laguna province along the south-eastern coast of Laguna de Bay, Santa Cruz lies {{convert|87|km}} southeast of Metro Manila via Calamba and is geographically located at approximately 14 degrees 17' latitude and 121 degrees 25' longitude.
