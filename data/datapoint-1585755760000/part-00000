The thesis defended is that more fruit and vegetables might have a protective role. Fruit (except raisins and dried fruit) are very poor in ochratoxin, and processed meat can be rich in ochratoxin.\n\n==Dermal exposure==\nOchratoxin A can permeate through the human skin.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 22749975 | title = Human skin penetration of selected model mycotoxins | year = 2012 | last1 = Boonen| first1 = Jente| last2 = Malysheva| first2 = Svetlana V.| last3 = Taevernier| first3 = Lien| last4 = Diana Di Mavungu| first4 = Jos\u00e9| last5 = De Saeger | first5 = Sarah| last6 = De Spiegeleer | first6 = Bart| journal = Toxicology| volume = 301 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 21\u201332 | doi=10.1016/j.tox.2012.06.012}}</ref> Although no significant health risk is expected after dermal contact in agricultural or residential environments, skin exposure to ochratoxin A should nevertheless be limited.\n\n==Genetic resistance==\nIn 1975 Woolf et al<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1975.tb00635.x Woolf L, Mcbean M, Woolf F, et al.
