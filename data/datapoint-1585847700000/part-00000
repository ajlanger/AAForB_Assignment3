From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard. Since the early 1990s, Safdie, a citizen of Canada, Israel, and the United States, has focused on his architectural practice, Safdie Architects, which is based in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], and has branches in Toronto, Jerusalem, and Singapore.\n\nSafdie has designed six of Canada's principal public institutions\u2014including the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in Ottawa, and [[Vancouver Public Library|Vancouver Library Square]]\u2014as well as many other notable projects around the world, including the [[Salt Lake City Public Library|Salt Lake City Main Public Library]]; the [[Virasat-e-Khalsa|Khalsa Heritage Centre]] in Punjab, India; the [[Marina Bay Sands]] integrated resort in Singapore; the [[United States Institute of Peace Headquarters]] in Washington, DC; the [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]] in Kansas City, Missouri; and the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\n==Architectural style==\n[[File:Marina_Bay_Sands_in_the_evening_-_20101120.jpg|thumb|Marina Bay Sands, Singapore]]\n[[File:Raffles_City_Chongqing_2019-9.jpg|thumb|Raffles City, Chongqing, China]]\nMoshe Safdie's works are known for their dramatic curves, arrays of geometric patterns, use of windows, and key placement of open and green spaces. His writings and designs stress the need to create meaningful, vital, and inclusive spaces that enhance community, with special attention to the essence of a particular locale, geography, and culture.\n\nHe is a self-described modernist.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* Gold Medal, American Institute of Architects\n* Companion of the Order of Canada\n* Gold Medal, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada\n* Richard Neutra Award for Professional Excellence\n* Mt.
