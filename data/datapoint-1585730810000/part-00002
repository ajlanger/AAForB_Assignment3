The Lloyds moved to Scotland for three years because of John's work, and it was there that Matthew picked up [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[soccer]] playing for his [[Currie]] club.\n\nLloyd attended St Martin De Porres Parish Primary School in [[Avondale Heights]] before moving to [[St. Bernard's College, Melbourne]].<ref>[http://sbc.melb.catholic.edu.au/groups/oc/wof.html St Bernard's Old Collegians Wall of Fame]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe supported the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] when he was young because in the first game he attended, Fitzroy player [[Bernie Quinlan]] kicked nine goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=37730 |title=Unforgettable time for Lloyd |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===AFL===\nLloyd was drafted into the AFL as a 16-year-old in the [[1994 AFL Draft|1995 Pre-season Draft]] as a \"compensatory selection\" that was awarded to Essendon by the AFL in return for losing [[Todd Ridley]] to the newly formed [[Fremantle Football Club]]. The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.\n\nThe key features of Lloyd's game were his powerful [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]s on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from [[set shot]]s on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the [[50-metre arc]] and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.\n\nLloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking. In 2006, the AFL introduced a \"shot clock\" to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd's ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the \"Lloyd Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/lloyd-rule-to-speed-up-goalkicking/2005/11/25/1132703381229.html |title=Lloyd Rule to speed up goalkicking |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.\n\nLloyd's goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.\n\n[[File:Matthew lloyd.jpg|220px|thumb|Lloyd in the 2007 AFL season]]\n\nLloyd was selected in the [[All-Australian team]] on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the [[Coleman Medal]] for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |title=Coleman Medal - Previous Winners |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924113126/http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).\n\nLloyd was a member of Essendon's 2000 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009.

The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.\n\nThe key features of Lloyd's game were his powerful [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]s on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from [[set shot]]s on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the [[50-metre arc]] and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.\n\nLloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking. In 2006, the AFL introduced a \"shot clock\" to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd's ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the \"Lloyd Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/lloyd-rule-to-speed-up-goalkicking/2005/11/25/1132703381229.html |title=Lloyd Rule to speed up goalkicking |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.\n\nLloyd's goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.\n\n[[File:Matthew lloyd.jpg|220px|thumb|Lloyd in the 2007 AFL season]]\n\nLloyd was selected in the [[All-Australian team]] on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the [[Coleman Medal]] for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |title=Coleman Medal - Previous Winners |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924113126/http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).\n\nLloyd was a member of Essendon's 2000 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009.
