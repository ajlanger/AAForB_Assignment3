The history of Kasur is more than 1,000 years. Kasur region was agricultural region with forests during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The [[Vedic period]] is characterized by [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] culture that migrated from [[Central Asia]] and settled in [[Punjab region]]. The [[Kambojas]], [[Daradas]], [[Kekaya|Kaikayas]], [[Pauravas]], [[Yaudheya]]s, [[Malavas]] and [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]s migrated, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] in 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Kasur region was ruled by [[Maurya Empire]], [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] and [[Shahi]] kingdoms.\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]], In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of the Punjab region.\n\nThe [[Mughal Empire]] ruled Kasur for 200 years. After and during the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh]]s took over the Kasur District. The agriculture lands were given to leaders and supporters of the Sikh army. Most of the Punjab region was annexed by the [[East India Company]] in 1849, and was one of the last areas of the [[South Asia]] to fall under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]]. During the [[British Raj]], the irrigation canals were built that irrigated large areas barren lands of the Kasur District.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]].  After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and Sikhs migrated to [[India]] while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Kasur District.\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 1998 census, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is the most widely spoken [[first language]]<ref>\"Mother tongue\": defined as the language of communication between parents and children.</ref> ({{sigfig|88.2|2}}%), whereas [[Urdu]] was the first language of 6.2% of the population. The district is unusual in that Urdu accounts for a greater proportion of speakers in rural (7.3%) than in urban areas (2.6%).<ref name=\"1998census\"/>{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe [[Bambawali-Ravi-Bedian Canal]] was built in Kasur district increasing the agricultural development of the area. There has been commercial and industrial development but the area remain mainly agricultural. [[Pakistan Army]] built [[Cantonment]] area for an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] in the district.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe district is administratively subdivided into 4 [[tehsils]]<ref>[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/admin_unit/admin_list_tehsil.html List of Tehsils] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230183032/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/admin_unit/admin_list_tehsil.html |date=2010-12-30 }}</ref> and 125 [[Union Councils of Pakistan|Union Councils]]:<ref>[http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=14&dn=Kasur Tehsils & Unions in the District of Kasur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807195906/http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=14&dn=Kasur |date=2011-08-07 }}</ref>\nthe total area of ksur is 3995 km2\n\n==Physical features==\nThe district is bounded by the [[Ravi River]] in the north-west and river [[Sutlej]] in the south-east. Whereas the old course of [[Beas River]] bifurcates the district into two equal parts locally known as Hither and Uthar or Mithan Majh. Both of the areas have a height differential of approximately 5.5 meters. The natural surface elevation of the district is 198 meters above the sea level, having a general slope from north-east to south- west. Whereas the east and west ends of the district comprise the flood plains of the rivers [[Satluj]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], characterized by breaching of looping river Channels braided around meander bars. Kasur district is attached with [[Lahore]] from east, attached with [[Nankana Sahib]] from north, attached with [[Faisalabad]] from west and attached with [[Okara District|Okara]] and India from south.\n\n===Topography===\nTopographically speaking, Kasur District lies between the river [[Satluj]] which flows along its boundaries with India and river [[Ravi River|Ravi]] which flows its boundary with [[Nankana Sahib District]]. The districts may be divided into two parts, a low lying or riverine area along the two bordering rivers and upland, away from the rivers. The riverine area is generally inundates during [[monsoon]] season. The water level in this area is higher than in the upland. The soil is sandy. The upland is flat plains sloping from north-west to south-west. The general height of the area is from 150 to 200 meters above the sea level.\n\n===Flora===\n[[Flora]] of the district has been greatly modified by human agency of the old open forests of small trees and shrubs; there remains only a few Rakhs or portions of forest which are kept as gazing ground for cattle etc. Amongst trees the most important are Kikar (Acacia arabica), Shisham or Tahli (Dalbergia sissoo), Beri (Zizyphus jajaba), Toot (Morus marlaccae), Sharin (Albizzia lebbek), Dharek (Malia azerdaracb), Phulahi (Acacia modesta), and Nim (Melia indica), Piple (Ficus indica) are planted for shade. The growth in Rakhs is composed mainly of three kinds of trees Jand (Prosopis spicigera), Karril (Capparis aphylla), and van or Jal (Salvadora obeoides). Occasionally pelu (acacia Loucophhloea) and Farash (Tamarix articulate) are also found. Pilchi (Tamarix gallio) is found on moist sandy soil along the rivers and is used for wicker-work, basket making etc.\n\n===Fauna===\nWolf and jackal are the only wild animals of any importance. The former being met with occasionally in the low land wastes of [[Chunian]] Tehsil but jackal are found every where. [[Changa Manga]] reserve a thick forest is the only area in which a few Nelgai, pig, peafowl and here are found.\n\n==Places of interest==\nKasur is adjacent to the border.
