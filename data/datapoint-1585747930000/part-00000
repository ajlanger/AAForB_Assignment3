They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam. Miss Cackle encourages her to do what she is good at, but she only manages to get 1%, due to filling her paper with drawings instead of answers, as her best subject is art. Miss Cackle's twin sister, Agatha, turns up, and Miss Cackle gives her permission to speak to Miss Hardbroom for an internet article. The students make their potions and Mildred successfully manages to levitate, after taking some of Ethel's pondweed from her dragon potion (due to Ethel having taken all of it), making Ethel wrongly turn into a worm.\n\n''First appearances'': [[Bella Ramsey]] as [[Mildred Hubble]], Meibh Campbell as Maud Spellbody, Jenny Richardson as [[Ethel Hallow]], Miriam Petche as Esmerelda Hallow, Tallulah Milligan as [[Drusilla Paddock]], Dagny Rollins as Felicity Foxglove, [[Clare Higgins]] as Miss Ada Cackle/Agatha Cackle, [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hecate Hardbroom, [[Wendy Craig]] as Miss Bat, [[Shauna Shim]] as Miss Drill, [[Kacey Ainsworth]] as Miss Gullet, [[Zita Sattar]] as Miss Tapioca and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Julie Hubble\n\n''Note'': Episode 1 and 2 aired in a 1 hour episode.\n|LineColor       = 69AFFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n|Title           = Tabby\n|DirectedBy      = Brian Grant\n|WrittenBy       = Emma Reeves\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|18|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cbbc/status/819213818|title=CBBC (@cbbc) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.334\n|ShortSummary    = On their first day, Mildred's phone is confiscated by Miss Hardbroom.

Mrs Hallow is magicked to the school and Ethel is hurt that Mrs Hallow did it out of revenge for Esmerelda and she is sacked from the council while Miss Cackle is reinstated.\n\n''Guest Starring'': Miss Pentangle\n\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 24\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n|Title           = Love at First Sight\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Claire Miller\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|19|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.277\n|ShortSummary    = On Halloween, Mildred scares Maud and Enid and with Clarice and Bea, Sybil tells them about a ghoul in one of the turrets. The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval. Esmerelda is forced to gain powers from the stone when Sybil has climbed out of the roof and on the verge of falling, which delights Ethel, but the stone dies.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25 <hr />26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 12 <hr />13\n|Title           = All Hallow's Eve\n|AltTitle        = The Big Freeze\n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.414\n|ShortSummary    = (All Hallow's Eve) Esmerelda attempts to give the powers back to the stone, but fails. Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers. The school is saved and later celebrates Halloween.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Series 3 (2019)===\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF36FF |overall=6 |series=6 |title=30 |director=14 |writer=20 |airdate=14 |viewers=10 |country=UK | viewersR=<ref name=\"BARB2\">[https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/ Weekly top programmes on four screens (from Sept 2018)] Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB)</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 27\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = The Wishing Star\n|DirectedBy      = Dirk Campbell\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|7|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2019/01/07|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.279\n|ShortSummary    = Mildred enters the Great Wizard\u2019s broomstick-flying contest to win a Wishing Star so she can wish her Mum magical, but trouble arises when she competes with her new stray dog rather than Tabby.

Miss Cackle assigns Mildred and Ethel the head-girl-competition task of discovering the prankster. Meanwhile Fenella is too controlling in her dining etiquette project (plus sabotage by the prankster) results in the coven leaving her. Mildred sees an unattached shadow of Azura's silhouette, leading to the revelation Azura had cast a spell to rid herself of scary dark shadows: her own became detached causing the events.

With Mildred and Ethel getting ready for the final head girl challenge (to create a new spell) Mildred starts to suffer from magical burnout. Knowing this Maud, Izzy and Mrs Cackle decide to send her to rest at Izzy's farm to watch the comet. Upon arriving Mildred's attempts at magic go wrong to the point of her magic completely failing. After a bit of digging it is found that Mildred needs her family's grounding stone to restore her magic, and since she has no idea where it is, Izzy's dad hatch's a plan to use the comet to create a new one.\nBack at the school Ethel tries to disqualify Mildred from the head girl competition by snitching on a half-heard conversation between Mildred and Professor Daisy when returning his sandtimer. Maud and Azura try to delay Ethel, this only works for a short while before Ethel brings Miss Hardbroom into it. This leads to a confrontation with Mr Daisy who ultimately protects Mildred by claiming he was the one to loop time. And come the end of term will be fired.\nBack at the farm Mildred and Izzy's attempts to create a new grounding stone ultimately fail, when all is assumed lost Mildred's true grounding stone is found as Izzy's dad (Spike Jones played by Alun Raglan) was given it by Mrs Hubble many years ago in Morroco.

Ethel Hallow makes a good first impression on the teachers. Mildred helps Maud, whose glasses were broken in the crash, get to school, but they both crash-land in the pond. They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam.

The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval.

Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers.
