It exists exclusively in [[Christianity]] and related religions, as others generally do not contain a Eucharistic ceremony.\n\nIn the [[Gospel]] accounts of Jesus' earthly ministry, a crowd of listeners challenges him regarding the rain of manna before he delivers the famous [[Bread of Life Discourse]] ({{bibleverse||John|6:22\u201359|RSV}}), and he describes himself as the \"True Bread from [[Heaven]]\".<ref>''The Gospel According to John: A Literary and Theological Commentary'' by Thomas L. Brodie 1997 {{ISBN|0-19-511811-1}} p. 266</ref> The aforementioned Bread of Life Discourse occurs in the [[Gospel of John]], {{Bibleverse-nb||John|6:30\u201359|KJV}}. Therein, Jesus promises to give His Flesh and Blood, which will give eternal life to all who receive It.  In John 6:53 (RSV), Jesus says, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\"  And continues, (v. 54\u201355) \"he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed.\"  Every year, the nation of Israel celebrated the Passover Meal, remembering and celebrating their liberation from captivity in Egypt.  It was at the Passover that Jesus Christ celebrated the Last Supper with his Apostles.\n\n[[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] in his [[First Letter to the Corinthians]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201326|KJV}}) and the [[Synoptic Gospels]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|26:26\u201328|KJV}}), [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:22\u201324|KJV}}), and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19\u201320|KJV}}) state that Jesus, in the course of the [[Last Supper]] on the night before his [[death and resurrection of Jesus|death and resurrection]], [[Last Supper#Institution of the Eucharist|said]]: \"This is my body\", and \"This is my blood\". For instance, Matthew recounts: \"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\" The [[Gospel of John]], on the other hand, makes no mention of this. One explanation offered is that he wrote his Gospel to supplement what the other [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s had already written.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=Richard|title=New Testament|date=2009|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=9780334040606|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4oWyn4nGxGIC&pg=PA364&dq=John+Gospel+supplementing+Synoptics+%22last+supper%22#v=onepage&q=John%20Gospel%20supplementing%20Synoptics%20%22last%20supper%22&f=false|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Merrill F.|title=The New Unger's Bible Handbook|date=2005|publisher=Moody|isbn=9781575676340|page=444|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zpl1060FCcQC&pg=PA444&dq=John+Gospel+supplementing+Synoptics+%22last+supper%22#v=onepage&q=John%20Gospel%20supplementing%20Synoptics%20%22last%20supper%22&f=false|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\nBecause Jesus Christ is a person, theologies regarding the Eucharist involve consideration of the way in which the communicant's personal relationship with God is fed through this mystical meal. However, debates over Eucharistic theology in the West have centered not on the personal aspects of Christ's presence but on the metaphysical. The opposing views are summarized below.\n\n===Real presence===\n{{main article|Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist}}\n\n====Transubstantiation====\n{{Main article|Transubstantiation|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\nThe [[Substance theory|substance]] (fundamental reality) of the bread and wine is changed in a way beyond human comprehension into that of the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ, but the [[accident (philosophy)|accidents]] (physical traits, including chemical properties) of the bread and wine remain.  This view is taught by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], including its Eastern Rites.\n\n====Definitive change====\nEastern Orthodox Christians generally prefer not to be tied down by the specifics of the defined doctrine of transubstantiation, though they all agree with the definition's conclusion about the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. They prefer simply to use the term \"change\" (Greek: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), as in the [[epiclesis]] of the [[Divine Liturgy]], to describe the change of the bread and wine into the actual [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]].<ref>{{Cite book|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = Timothy Ware|title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|pages = [https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290 290ff]|isbn = 0-14-020592-6|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290}}</ref> (See \"[[Eucharistic theology#Objective reality.2C silence about technicalities|Objective reality, silence about technicalities]]\", below.) The terminology of transubstantiation was adopted within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] by the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] (1672), although it is not recognized as having the authority of an [[Ecumenical Council]] and has been criticized for a perceived tendency toward [[Liturgical Latinisation|Latinization]].\n\n====Consubstantiation====\n{{Main article|Consubstantiation}}\n\"The bread retains its substance and ... Christ\u2019s glorified body comes down into the bread through the consecration and is found there together with the natural substance of the bread, without quantity but whole and complete in every part of the sacramental bread.\" It was the position of the [[Lollardist]]s.<ref>Bengt H\u00e4gglund, ''History of Theology'', Gene J.

This is the position of the Lutheran Church that echoes the next view with its \"pious silence about technicalities\" in that it objects to philosophical terms like \"consubstantiation.\"\n\n====Objective reality, silence about technicalities====\n\"Objective reality, but pious silence about technicalities\" (or \"divine [or holy] mystery\") is the view of all the ancient Churches of the East, as well as of many Anglicans (including those of [[Anglo-Catholic]] churchmanship) and [[Methodists]].<ref name=\"Poulson1999\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gbod.org/worship/thisholymystery/parttwo.html |title=This Holy Mystery: Part Two |publisher=The United Methodist Church GBOD |accessdate=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020212029/http://www.gbod.org/worship/thisholymystery/parttwo.html |archivedate=20 October 2004 |df=dmy }}</ref> While they agree that in the sacrament the bread and the wine are really and truly changed into the body and the blood of Christ, and while they have at times employed the terminology of \"substance\" to explain what is changed,<ref>\"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the ''substance'' of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the ''accidents'' of the bread\" ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Confession of Dositheus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012149/http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html |date=27 September 2011 }}, Synod of Jerusalem); \"the word ''transubstantiation'' is not to be taken to define the manner in which the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of the Lord; for this none can understand but God; but only thus much is signified, that the bread truly, really, and ''substantially'' becomes the very true Body of the Lord, and the wine the very Blood of the Lord\" ([http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm ''The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church'']); the [http://www.bible.ca/cr-Orthodox.htm#catechism Catechism of the Eastern Orthodox Church] also uses the term ''transubstantiation''.</ref> they usually avoid this language, considering it redolent of [[scholasticism]], as presenting speculative metaphysics as doctrine, and as scrutinizing excessively the manner in which the mystical transformation takes place.\n\n====Pneumatic presence====\n{{Main|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}\n\"Real Spiritual presence\", also called \"pneumatic presence\", holds that not only the Spirit of Christ, but also the true body and blood of Jesus Christ (hence \"real\"), are received by the sovereign, mysterious, and miraculous power of the Holy Spirit (hence \"spiritual\"), but only by those partakers who have faith. This view approaches the \"pious silence\" view in its unwillingness to specify how the Holy Spirit makes Christ present, but positively excludes not just symbolism but also trans- and con-substantiation. It is also known as the \"mystical presence\" view, and is held by some [[Low Church]] Reformed Anglicans, as well as other [[Presbyterian]] Christians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pursuingveritas.com/2017/10/19/a-brief-history-of-communion-five-reformation-views/|title=A Brief History of Communion: Five Reformation Views|last=Prahlow|first=Jacob J.|date=19 October 2017|publisher=Pursuing Veritas|language=English|accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref> This understanding is often called \"receptionism\". Some argue that this view can be seen as being suggested\u2014though not clearly\u2014by the \"[[epiclesis|invocation]]\" of the Anglican Rite as found in the American [[Book of Common Prayer]], 1928 and earlier and in Rite I of the American BCP of 1979 as well as in other Anglican formularies:\n: ''And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to hear us, and of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless and sanctify, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts and creatures of bread and wine; that we, receiving them according to thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood.''\n\n===Memorialism===\nThe bread and wine are symbolic of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, and in partaking of the elements the believer commemorates the sacrificial death of Christ. Christ is not present in the sacrament, except in the minds and hearts of the communicants. This view is also known as \"memorialism\" and \"Zwinglianism\" after [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and is held by most [[Anabaptists]],<ref name=\"Willis2017\">{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Wendell|title=Eucharist and Ecclesiology|date=6 January 2017|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781498282932|page=52|quote=The Anabaptists picked up from Zwingli an emphasis on the memorial aspects of the Eucharist. The ''Schleitheim Confession of Faith'' in 1527 stated: \"All those who wish to break bread in remembrance of the broken body of Christ, and all who wish to drink of one drink as a remembrance of the shed blood of Christ, shall be united beforehand by baptism in one body of Christ.}}</ref> [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], as well as [[Latter-day Saint]] denominations.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe partaking of the bread and wine was not intended to be a perpetual ordinance, or was not to be taken as a religious rite or ceremony (also known as ''adeipnonism,'' meaning \"no supper\" or \"no meal\"). This is the view of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and the [[Salvation Army]], as well as the [[hyperdispensationalism|hyperdispensationalist]] positions of [[E. W. Bullinger]], Cornelius R. Stam, and others.\n\n==Efficacy of the rite==\n{{Main article|Ex opere operato}}\nEastern and Western eucharistic traditions generally agree with St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] in teaching that the efficacy of the sacraments as a means of divine grace does not depend on the worthiness of the priest or minister administering them. Augustine developed this concept in his controversy with the [[Donatists]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|title=A History of Christian Thought, volume 2|publisher=Nashville:Abingdon Press|year=1987|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In traditional Christianity, the efficacy and validity of the sacrament does, however, depend on properly ordained [[bishop]]s and [[priest (Christianity)|priests]] with a lineage from the Apostles, a doctrine called \"[[apostolic succession]]\".\n\n==Theologies of different churches==\n\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\n{{Main article|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Missa tridentina 002.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Elevation of the Eucharist at a [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] Catholic Mass]]\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], the Communion bread is fervently revered in view of the Church's doctrine that, when bread and wine are consecrated during the Eucharistic celebration, they cease to be bread and wine and become the body and blood of Christ. The empirical appearances continue to exist unchanged, but the reality is changed by the power of the Holy Spirit, Who has been called down upon the bread and wine.  The separate consecrations of the bread (known as the [[sacramental bread|host]]) and of the wine symbolizes the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at Calvary. However, since He has risen, the Church teaches that His Body and Blood are no longer actually separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or other minister) says \"The Body of Christ\" when administering the host and \"The Blood of Christ\" when presenting the chalice, the [[communicant]] who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire, body and blood, soul and divinity.<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm Council of Trent, Session XIII, canon 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211215226/http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm |date=11 February 2008 }};[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1390]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04175a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', Communion under Both Kinds]</ref> This belief is succinctly summarised in St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' hymn, ''[[Adoro Te Devote]]''.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01154b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, article \"Adoro Te Devote\"]</ref>\n\nThe mysterious<ref>The Roman Catholic Church holds that no explanation is possible about ''how'' the change from bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ is brought about, and limits itself to teaching ''what'' is changed: \"The signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333], emphasis added).</ref> change of the reality of the bread and wine began to be called \"transubstantiation\" in the 11th century. The earliest known text in which the term appears is a sermon of 1079 by [[Gilbert of Savardin]], [[Archbishop of Tours]], (''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' CLXXI 776). The first appearance of the term in a papal document was in the letter of [[Pope Innocent III]] ''Cum Marthae circa'' to [[John of Canterbury]] on 29 November 1202,<ref>[http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma5.html Denzinger] 416</ref> then briefly in the decree ''Firmiter credimus'' of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215)<ref>[http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma5.html Denzinger] 430</ref> and afterward in the book \"Iamdudum\" sent to the Armenians in the year 1341.<ref>[http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma6.html Denzinger] 544</ref> An explanation utilizing Aristotle's [[hylomorphic]] theory of reality did not appear until the thirteenth century, with [[Alexander of Hales]] (died 1245).\n\nThe actual moment of change is believed to be the priest's [[liturgy|liturgical]] recitation of the [[Words of Institution]]: \"This is my Body\u2026\" and \"This is the Chalice of my Blood\u2026\".\n\n[[File:Mass at Lourdes.jpg|thumb|320px|left|At a celebration of the Eucharist at [[Lourdes]], the chalice is shown to the people immediately after the consecration of the wine.]]\n\nThe Eucharist is a [[sacrifice]] in that it literally re-presents (in the sense  of \"makes present again\") the same and only sacrifice offered once for all on the cross.<ref>[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#360 ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''], 1366</ref> The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice.

In other words, the priest celebrant represents Christ Himself, who is the Head of the Church, and acts before God the Father in the name of the Catholic Church, always using \"we\" not \"I\" during the Eucharistic prayer .

Orthodox [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] affirm the real presence in the [[Sacred Mysteries]] ([[consecrated]] bread and wine) which they believe to be the actual Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. The Eucharist is normally received in the context of the Divine Liturgy. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Church has never described exactly ''how'' this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Roman Catholic Church has with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. This doctrine was formulated after the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] took place, and the Eastern Orthodox churches have never formally affirmed or denied it, preferring to state simply that it is a \"Mystery\",<ref>Ware pp. 283\u2013285</ref> while at the same time using, as in the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem, language that might look similar as to one that is used by the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>For instance, \"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the substance of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the accidents of the bread\" ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Chapter VI of ''Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012149/http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html |date=27 September 2011 }}).</ref>\n\nThe [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] (Eucharistic prayer) contains an [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]] (lit. \"making present\") which not only recounts the historical facts of Jesus' death and resurrection, but actually makes them present, forming an undivided link to the one unique event on [[Calvary]]. The Anaphora ends with an [[epiclesis]] (\"calling down from on high\") during which the [[priest]] invokes the [[Holy Spirit]] to come and \"change\" the Gifts (elements of bread and wine) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. The Orthodox do not link the moment the Gifts change to the [[Words of Institution]], or indeed to any one particular moment. They merely affirm that the change is ''completed'' at the Epiclesis.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptized, chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer, and confession (different rules apply for children, elderly, sick, pregnant, etc. and are determined on a case-by-case basis by parish priests). The priest administers the Gifts with a spoon directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.<ref>Ware p. 287</ref> From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive Holy Communion.<ref>Ware p. 279</ref>\n\nThe holy gifts reserved for the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or communion of the sick are specially consecrated as needed, especially on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. They are kept in an elaborately decorated [[Church tabernacle#Eastern Orthodox Church|tabernacle]], a container on the altar often in the shape of a church or of a dove. Generally, Eastern Christians do not adore the consecrated bread outside the Liturgy itself. However, they prostrate to the ground during the transfer of the Holy Gifts during the Presanctified Liturgy (the \"Entrance\"), as a sign of utmost reverence. After the Eucharist has been given to the congregation, the priest or the deacon has to consume the Holy Gifts that are left.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Icon last supper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian icon]] of the [[Last Supper]] (1497)]]\n\nIn the Orthodox Churches, the Eucharistic celebration is known as the Divine Liturgy and is believed to impart the actual Body and Blood of Christ to the faithful. In the act of communion, the entire Church\u2014past, present, and even future\u2014is united in eternity. In Orthodox Eucharistic theology, although many separate Divine Liturgies may be celebrated, there is only one Bread and one Cup throughout all the world and throughout all time.\n\nThe most perfect expression of the Eucharistic unity of the church is found in the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy (i.e., a Liturgy at which a [[bishop]] is the chief celebrant), for as St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] stated, where the bishop is, surrounded by his clergy and faithful, there is the church in all of her fullness.\n\n=== Anglican Church ===\n{{Main article|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}\n\nThe historical position of the [[Church of England]] is found in the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'' of 1571, which state \"the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\"; and likewise that \"the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ\" (Articles of Religion, Article XXVIII: Of the Lord's Supper) and that \"Transubstantiation is repugnant to Holy Writ\". However, the Articles also state that adoration, or worship ''per se,'' of the consecrated elements was not commanded by Christ. It also stated that those who receive unworthily do not actually receive Christ but rather their own condemnation.\n\nAnglicans generally and officially believe in the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specifics of belief regarding the manner of His presence range from a belief in the [[Anglican_eucharistic_theology#Corporeal_presence|corporeal presence]], sometimes but not always affirming Eucharistic adoration (mainly [[Anglo-Catholics]]),<ref name=\"Poulson1999\">{{cite book|last=Poulson|first=Christine|title=The Quest for the Grail: Arthurian Legend in British Art, 1840\u20131920|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0719055379|page=40|quote=By the late 1840s Anglo-Catholic interest in the revival of ritual had given new life to doctrinal debate over the nature of the Eucharist.

The normal range of Anglican belief ranges from Objective Reality to Pious Silence, depending on the individual Anglican's theology.

Of particular note here is the Church's unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but, rather, a ''re-presentation'' of Christ Jesus:\n\n::Holy Communion is remembrance, commemoration, and memorial, but this remembrance is much more than simply intellectual recalling. \"Do this in remembrance of me\" ({{bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}; {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:24\u201325}}) is ''anamnesis'' (the biblical Greek word). This dynamic action becomes re-presentation of past gracious acts of God in the present, so powerfully as to make them truly present now. Christ is risen and is alive here and now, not just remembered for what was done in the past.\n\nThis affirmation of Real Presence can be seen clearly illustrated in the language of the United Methodist Eucharistic Liturgy (for example: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090417073138/http://www.revneal.org/communionlit1.html Word and Table 1]) where, in the epiclesis of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Great Thanksgiving]], the celebrating minister prays over the elements:\n\n{{cquote|Pour out your Holy Spirit on us gathered here, and on these gifts of bread and wine.

Of the Sacraments.|Westminster Confession of Faith Ch. XXVII Sec. 7]]</ref> The elements are spiritual nourishment in Christ by faith. According to John Calvin,\n\n:The sum is, that the flesh and blood of Christ feed our souls just as bread and wine maintain and support our corporeal life. For there would be no aptitude in the sign, did not our souls find their nourishment in Christ. [...] I hold...that the sacred mystery of the Supper consists of two things\u2014the corporeal signs, which, presented to the eye, represent invisible things in a manner adapted to our weak capacity, and the spiritual truth, which is at once figured and exhibited by the signs.<ref name=\"Calvin\">Calvin, [[Institutes of the Christian Religion]], book 4, chapter 17, points 10\u201311 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xviii.html]</ref>\n\nFollowing a phrase of Augustine, the Calvinist view is that \"no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith.\" \"The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God's elect believers\", Calvin said.  Faith, not a mere mental apprehension, and the work of the Holy Spirit, are necessary for the partaker to behold God incarnate, and in the same sense touch Christ with their hands; so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ's actual presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>  The 'experience' of Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper, has traditionally been spoken of in the following way: the faithful believers are 'lifted up' by the power of the Holy Spirit to feast with Christ in heaven.  The Lord's Supper in this way is truly a 'Spiritual' experience as the Holy Spirit is directly involved in the action of 'eucharist'.\n\nThe Calvinist/Reformed view also places great emphasis on the action of the community as the Body of Christ.  As the faith community participates in the action of celebrating the Lord's Supper they are 'transformed' into the Body of Christ, or 'reformed' into the Body of Christ each time they participate in this sacrament.  In this sense it has been said that the term \"transubstantiation\" can be applied to the Faith Community (the Church) itself being transformed into the real Body and Blood of Christ truly present in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAlthough Calvin rejected adoration of the Eucharistic bread and wine as \"idolatry\" later Reformed Christians have argued otherwise. Leftover elements may be disposed of without ceremony (or reused in later services); they are unchanged, and as such the meal directs attention toward Christ's bodily resurrection and return.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>\n\nChristians in the [[Presbyterian Church U.S.A.]] and some Christians in the [[United Church of Christ]] would reverently endorse this view.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTheology in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] branch of this tradition is in flux, and recent agreements between these denominations and the [[Lutheran]]s have stressed that: \"The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, p. 66).\" Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the Real Presence, the churches have written:\n::\"During the Reformation both Reformed and Lutheran Churches exhibited an evangelical intention when they understood the Lord's Supper in the light of the saving act of God in Christ. Despite this common intention, different terms and concepts were employed which. . . led to mutual misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Properly interpreted, the differing terms and concepts were often complementary rather than contradictory (Marburg Revisited, pp. 103\u2013104);\"\n:and further:\n::\"In the Lord's Supper the risen Christ imparts himself in body and blood, given up for all, through his word of promise with bread and wine....we proclaim the death of Christ through which God has reconciled the world with himself. We proclaim the presence of the risen Lord in our midst. Rejoicing that the Lord has come to us, we await his future coming in glory....Both of our communions, we maintain, need to grow in appreciation of our diverse eucharistic traditions, finding mutual enrichment in them.

In their understanding of the Reformed tradition, the participation in this sacrament should follow the sacrament of baptism. Just as humans need food and drink for nurture and sustenance, Calvin wrote that the Holy Meal of Lord's Supper is God's way of providing for the maintenance of sinful humans during the whole course of their lives after they have been received into God's family, in what Presbyterians call \"the Covenant Community\".<ref>David McKay \u2013 [https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant-community/ Covenant Community] \u2013 ''ligonier.org.''

It is a primal physical act in the Church that signifies a spiritual relationship between personal beings.  And this is what the Eucharist is in Presbyterian understanding.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nAccording to Presbyterian Eucharistic theology, there's not actual \"transubstantiation\" in the bread and wine, but that Jesus is spiritually present in the elements of the Eucharist, authentically present in the non-atom-based substance, with which they believe that he is [[Consubstantiality|con-substantial]] with God in the [[Trinity]].   They teach that Christ is genuinely there in the elements of the Lord's Supper to be received by them, and not just in their memories.    So that it is both a memorial and a presence of Christ.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nThey teach that receiving the Communion elements is taking the symbolic representation of the broken body and shed blood of Jesus into the inmost being, receiving the Jesus who died for our forgiveness and transformation. That humans depend on these elements for their very life and salvation.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nPresbyterians believe that the Word of God should be read, proclaimed and enacted in the Lord's Supper as an integral part of worship. The relationship of Word and Sacrament can be understood in the context of the Emmaus Road narrative (Luke 24:13ff). While there are various interpretations of this account, the Presbyterian Church interprets the \u201cbreaking of bread\u201d in Luke 24 as  a reference to the Lord's Supper.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nMany Presbyterian churches use unfermented grape juice for Communion, which is of relatively recent practice, starting in the late 19th century or in the past one hundred years, out of concern for drunkenness and also because some congregants view any alcohol as \"sinful\", so to accommodate their consciences grape juice is utilized in most Presbyterian churches instead.  But  recently some individual Presbyterian churches have gone back to using actual fermented wine as Christ used and commanded.  Noting that wine in itself is not sinful, but that Christ made and drank it, etc., and that only excessive drinking of wine and actual drunkenness are wrong and sinful.<ref>Jack Lash \u2013 [https://www.gpcweb.org/why-do-we-use-wine-in-communion- Why Do We Use Wine in Communion? ] Gainsevill Presbyterian Church, PCA. Retrieved December 23, 2019.</ref>  \n\nThe Directory for Worship in the Presbyterian [[Book of Order]] encourages the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of frequent celebrations of the Lord's Supper. A few Presbyterian congregations have begun celebrations of the sacrament as often as each Lord's Day (or Sunday) and on other occasions of special significance in the life of the Christian community. And also on Presbyterian \"liturgical seasons\", such as \"Holy Week\" and \"Easter\", the Lord's Supper is especially celebrated and observed in Presbyterian churches.<ref>[https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/worship/faq/faq-christianyear/ The Christian Year] - \"What are the liturgical seasons?\" ''PresbyterianMission.org.'' Retrieved January 27, 2020.</ref> But frequency alone is not the basic issue in Presbyterianism. Some believe that they need to restore the Biblical pattern of the Lord's Supper on each Sunday to provide a disciplined reminder of a divine act that will help centralize and \u201cre-focus\u201d the rhythm of people's daily lives.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\n===Baptist Churches===\n[[Reformed Baptists]], in agreement with Presbyterians and other Reformed Churches, hold to the doctrine of [[Pneumatic presence]]. The doctrine is articulated in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith]] and the [[Keach's Catechism|Catechism]]. It holds that the Lord's Supper to be a means of \"spiritual nourishment and growth\", stating:<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\"/>\n{{quote|The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the world the sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\">{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Anthony R.|last2=Thompson|first2=Philip E.|title=Baptist Sacramentalism|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781597527439|page=182}}</ref>}}\n\nIndependent Baptists hold to the [[Eucharist#Fundamental Independent Baptist (Hyles typology): Relational Presence|Relational Presence]]\n\nThe [[American Baptist Churches USA]], a mainline Baptist denomination, believes that \"The bread and cup that symbolize the broken body and shed blood offered by Christ remind us today of God's great love for us...\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417142835/http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Zwinglianism ===\n{{Main article|Memorialism}}\n\nSome Protestant groups regard the Eucharist (also called the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Table) as a symbolic meal, a [[Memorialism|memorial]] of the Last Supper and the Passion in which nothing miraculous occurs. This view is known as the Zwinglian view, after Huldrych Zwingli, a Church leader in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It is commonly associated with the United Church of Christ, Baptists, the [[Disciples of Christ]] and the [[Mennonite]]s. Elements left over from the service may be discarded without any formal ceremony, or if feasible may be retained for use in future services.\n\nThe successor of Zwingli in Zurich, [[Heinrich Bullinger]], came to an agreement theologically with John Calvin. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002220509/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Tigurinus/tigur-bvd.htm Consensus Tigurinus] lays out an explanation of the doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and specifically, that of Holy Communion, as the view embraced by John Calvin and leaders of the Church of Zurich who followed Zwingli. It demonstrates that at least the successors of Zwingli held to the real spiritual presence view most commonly attributed to Calvin and Reformed [[Protestantism]].\n\nThe [[Plymouth Brethren]] hold the Lord's Supper, or the Breaking of Bread, instituted in the upper room on Christ's betrayal night, to be the weekly remembrance feast enjoined on all true Christians. They celebrate the supper in utmost simplicity. Among \"closed\" Brethren assemblies usually any one of the brothers gives thanks for the loaf and the cup. In conservative \"open\" Brethren assemblies usually two different brothers give thanks, one for the loaf and the other for the cup. In liberal \"open\" Brethren assemblies (or churches/community chapels, etc.) sisters also participate with audible prayer.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\nThe [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] views the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper as symbolically representing and commemorating the sinless body and blood of the [[Messiah|Messiah Jesus]], the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]].  They don't consider that the elements become supernaturally altered, or that Christ's actual physical presence is literally in the bread and wine per se, but that the elements (which they generally call \"emblems\") are commemorative and symbolic, and are consecrated for the Lord's Supper observance, and are figurative of the body and blood of Christ, as the true \"[[Passover Lamb|Lamb of God]]\" who died once for all, and view the celebration as an anti-typical fulfillment of the ancient [[Jewish Passover]] celebration, which memorialized the freeing and rescuing of God's covenant people [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] from painful bondage to sinful Egypt.   The Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,<ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient [[Jewish calendar]].<ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> They refer to this observance generally as \"the Lord's Evening Meal\" or the \"Memorial of Christ's Death\", taken from Jesus' words to his Apostles \"do this as a memorial of me\". (Luke 22:19)<ref>[https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers \u2013 Luke 22] \"This do in remembrance of me.\u2014Literally, ''as My memorial,'' or, ''as your memorial of Me.''\" \u2013 Retrieved October 18, 2019.</ref>  They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.<ref>\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, p. 8, \"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians\u2014the Memorial of his death.\"</ref>\n\nOf those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, with glorified bodies, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the \"anointed\" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized \"[[other sheep]]\" of Christ's flock, or the \"[[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'other sheep' and the 'great crowd'|great crowd]]\", also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving salvation, through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is memorialized by the Lord's Evening Meal, and with the hope of obtaining everlasting life in Paradise restored on a prophesied \"[[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]]\", under Christ as Redeemer and Ruler.<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \"emblems\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms and representations, denoting what was used in the first Lord's Supper, and which figuratively represent the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and sacred realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>\"Discerning What We Are \u2013 At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>\n\n===Quakers===\n*primary theological development from the 17th century\n*Eucharistic theology: suspension/[[Memorialism]]\n*\"The bread and wine remind us of Jesus' body and blood.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316024210/http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |archive-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Quakers understand all of life as being sacramental and thus do not practice baptism or holy communion. \"We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and in communion with that Spirit.

It is viewed as a renewal of the covenant made at [[baptism]], which is to take upon oneself the name of Jesus. As such, it is considered efficacious only for baptized members in good standing. However, the unbaptized are not forbidden from communion, and it is traditional for children not yet baptized (baptism occurs only after the age of eight) to participate in communion in anticipation of baptism. Those who partake of the Sacrament promise always to remember Jesus and keep his commandments. The prayer also asks God the Father that each individual will be blessed with the Spirit of Christ.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|20|75|79}} (see also {{lds|Moroni|moro|4|3}}, {{lds|Moroni|moro|5|2}})</ref>\n\nThe Sacrament is offered weekly and all active members are taught to prepare to partake of each opportunity. It is considered to be a weekly renewal of a member's commitment to follow Jesus Christ, and a plea for forgiveness of sins.\n\nThe Latter Day Saints do not believe in any kind of literal presence. They view the bread and water as symbolic of the body and blood of Christ. Currently [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses water instead of wine. Early in their history the Sacrament wine was often purchased from enemies of the church. To remove any opportunity for poisoned or unfit wine for use in the Sacrament, it is believed a revelation from the Lord was given that stated \"it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory\u2014remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\"<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|27|2}}</ref> After this time water was permitted in place of wine, but the church continued to use wine for the sacrament until the early 20th century. As the church's prohibition on alcohol became solidified in the early 20th century, water became the liquid of choice for the Sacrament, although in situations where clean water and/or fresh bread is unavailable the closest equivalent may be used.\n\n=== Seventh-day Adventists ===\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventists]] believe that the Lord's Supper is \"a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour.\" In the communion service \"Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people.\"<ref>[[28 Fundamentals|28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Origin of the Eucharist]]\n*[[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Eucharistic discipline]]\n*[[Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Typology (theology)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borgen, Ole E.

It exists exclusively in [[Christianity]] and related religions, as others generally do not contain a Eucharistic ceremony.\n\nIn the [[Gospel]] accounts of Jesus' earthly ministry, a crowd of listeners challenges him regarding the rain of manna before he delivers the famous [[Bread of Life Discourse]] ({{bibleverse||John|6:22\u201359|RSV}}), and he describes himself as the \"True Bread from [[Heaven]]\".<ref>''The Gospel According to John: A Literary and Theological Commentary'' by Thomas L. Brodie 1997 {{ISBN|0-19-511811-1}} p. 266</ref> The aforementioned Bread of Life Discourse occurs in the [[Gospel of John]], {{Bibleverse-nb||John|6:30\u201359|KJV}}. Therein, Jesus promises to give His Flesh and Blood, which will give eternal life to all who receive It.  In John 6:53 (RSV), Jesus says, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\"  And continues, (v. 54\u201355) \"he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed.\"  Every year, the nation of Israel celebrated the Passover Meal, remembering and celebrating their liberation from captivity in Egypt.  It was at the Passover that Jesus Christ celebrated the Last Supper with his Apostles.\n\n[[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] in his [[First Letter to the Corinthians]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201326|KJV}}) and the [[Synoptic Gospels]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|26:26\u201328|KJV}}), [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:22\u201324|KJV}}), and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19\u201320|KJV}}) state that Jesus, in the course of the [[Last Supper]] on the night before his [[death and resurrection of Jesus|death and resurrection]], [[Last Supper#Institution of the Eucharist|said]]: \"This is my body\", and \"This is my blood\". For instance, Matthew recounts: \"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\" The [[Gospel of John]], on the other hand, makes no mention of this. One explanation offered is that he wrote his Gospel to supplement what the other [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s had already written.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=Richard|title=New Testament|date=2009|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=9780334040606|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4oWyn4nGxGIC&pg=PA364&dq=John+Gospel+supplementing+Synoptics+%22last+supper%22#v=onepage&q=John%20Gospel%20supplementing%20Synoptics%20%22last%20supper%22&f=false|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Merrill F.|title=The New Unger's Bible Handbook|date=2005|publisher=Moody|isbn=9781575676340|page=444|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zpl1060FCcQC&pg=PA444&dq=John+Gospel+supplementing+Synoptics+%22last+supper%22#v=onepage&q=John%20Gospel%20supplementing%20Synoptics%20%22last%20supper%22&f=false|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\nBecause Jesus Christ is a person, theologies regarding the Eucharist involve consideration of the way in which the communicant's personal relationship with God is fed through this mystical meal. However, debates over Eucharistic theology in the West have centered not on the personal aspects of Christ's presence but on the metaphysical. The opposing views are summarized below.\n\n===Real presence===\n{{main article|Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist}}\n\n====Transubstantiation====\n{{Main article|Transubstantiation|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\nThe [[Substance theory|substance]] (fundamental reality) of the bread and wine is changed in a way beyond human comprehension into that of the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ, but the [[accident (philosophy)|accidents]] (physical traits, including chemical properties) of the bread and wine remain.  This view is taught by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], including its Eastern Rites.\n\n====Definitive change====\nEastern Orthodox Christians generally prefer not to be tied down by the specifics of the defined doctrine of transubstantiation, though they all agree with the definition's conclusion about the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. They prefer simply to use the term \"change\" (Greek: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), as in the [[epiclesis]] of the [[Divine Liturgy]], to describe the change of the bread and wine into the actual [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]].<ref>{{Cite book|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = Timothy Ware|title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|pages = [https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290 290ff]|isbn = 0-14-020592-6|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290}}</ref> (See \"[[Eucharistic theology#Objective reality.2C silence about technicalities|Objective reality, silence about technicalities]]\", below.)

This view approaches the \"pious silence\" view in its unwillingness to specify how the Holy Spirit makes Christ present, but positively excludes not just symbolism but also trans- and con-substantiation.

Christ is not present in the sacrament, except in the minds and hearts of the communicants.

Bullinger]], Cornelius R. Stam, and others.\n\n==Efficacy of the rite==\n{{Main article|Ex opere operato}}\nEastern and Western eucharistic traditions generally agree with St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] in teaching that the efficacy of the sacraments as a means of divine grace does not depend on the worthiness of the priest or minister administering them. Augustine developed this concept in his controversy with the [[Donatists]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|title=A History of Christian Thought, volume 2|publisher=Nashville:Abingdon Press|year=1987|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In traditional Christianity, the efficacy and validity of the sacrament does, however, depend on properly ordained [[bishop]]s and [[priest (Christianity)|priests]] with a lineage from the Apostles, a doctrine called \"[[apostolic succession]]\".\n\n==Theologies of different churches==\n\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\n{{Main article|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Missa tridentina 002.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Elevation of the Eucharist at a [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] Catholic Mass]]\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], the Communion bread is fervently revered in view of the Church's doctrine that, when bread and wine are consecrated during the Eucharistic celebration, they cease to be bread and wine and become the body and blood of Christ. The empirical appearances continue to exist unchanged, but the reality is changed by the power of the Holy Spirit, Who has been called down upon the bread and wine.  The separate consecrations of the bread (known as the [[sacramental bread|host]]) and of the wine symbolizes the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at Calvary. However, since He has risen, the Church teaches that His Body and Blood are no longer actually separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or other minister) says \"The Body of Christ\" when administering the host and \"The Blood of Christ\" when presenting the chalice, the [[communicant]] who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire, body and blood, soul and divinity.<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm Council of Trent, Session XIII, canon 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211215226/http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm |date=11 February 2008 }};[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1390]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04175a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', Communion under Both Kinds]</ref> This belief is succinctly summarised in St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' hymn, ''[[Adoro Te Devote]]''.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01154b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, article \"Adoro Te Devote\"]</ref>\n\nThe mysterious<ref>The Roman Catholic Church holds that no explanation is possible about ''how'' the change from bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ is brought about, and limits itself to teaching ''what'' is changed: \"The signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333], emphasis added).</ref> change of the reality of the bread and wine began to be called \"transubstantiation\" in the 11th century.

Orthodox [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] affirm the real presence in the [[Sacred Mysteries]] ([[consecrated]] bread and wine) which they believe to be the actual Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. The Eucharist is normally received in the context of the Divine Liturgy. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Church has never described exactly ''how'' this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Roman Catholic Church has with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. This doctrine was formulated after the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] took place, and the Eastern Orthodox churches have never formally affirmed or denied it, preferring to state simply that it is a \"Mystery\",<ref>Ware pp. 283\u2013285</ref> while at the same time using, as in the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem, language that might look similar as to one that is used by the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>For instance, \"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the substance of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the accidents of the bread\" ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Chapter VI of ''Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012149/http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html |date=27 September 2011 }}).</ref>\n\nThe [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] (Eucharistic prayer) contains an [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]] (lit. \"making present\") which not only recounts the historical facts of Jesus' death and resurrection, but actually makes them present, forming an undivided link to the one unique event on [[Calvary]]. The Anaphora ends with an [[epiclesis]] (\"calling down from on high\") during which the [[priest]] invokes the [[Holy Spirit]] to come and \"change\" the Gifts (elements of bread and wine) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. The Orthodox do not link the moment the Gifts change to the [[Words of Institution]], or indeed to any one particular moment. They merely affirm that the change is ''completed'' at the Epiclesis.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptized, chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer, and confession (different rules apply for children, elderly, sick, pregnant, etc. and are determined on a case-by-case basis by parish priests). The priest administers the Gifts with a spoon directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.<ref>Ware p. 287</ref> From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive Holy Communion.<ref>Ware p. 279</ref>\n\nThe holy gifts reserved for the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or communion of the sick are specially consecrated as needed, especially on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. They are kept in an elaborately decorated [[Church tabernacle#Eastern Orthodox Church|tabernacle]], a container on the altar often in the shape of a church or of a dove. Generally, Eastern Christians do not adore the consecrated bread outside the Liturgy itself. However, they prostrate to the ground during the transfer of the Holy Gifts during the Presanctified Liturgy (the \"Entrance\"), as a sign of utmost reverence. After the Eucharist has been given to the congregation, the priest or the deacon has to consume the Holy Gifts that are left.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Icon last supper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian icon]] of the [[Last Supper]] (1497)]]\n\nIn the Orthodox Churches, the Eucharistic celebration is known as the Divine Liturgy and is believed to impart the actual Body and Blood of Christ to the faithful. In the act of communion, the entire Church\u2014past, present, and even future\u2014is united in eternity. In Orthodox Eucharistic theology, although many separate Divine Liturgies may be celebrated, there is only one Bread and one Cup throughout all the world and throughout all time.\n\nThe most perfect expression of the Eucharistic unity of the church is found in the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy (i.e., a Liturgy at which a [[bishop]] is the chief celebrant), for as St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] stated, where the bishop is, surrounded by his clergy and faithful, there is the church in all of her fullness.\n\n=== Anglican Church ===\n{{Main article|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}\n\nThe historical position of the [[Church of England]] is found in the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'' of 1571, which state \"the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\"; and likewise that \"the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ\" (Articles of Religion, Article XXVIII: Of the Lord's Supper) and that \"Transubstantiation is repugnant to Holy Writ\". However, the Articles also state that adoration, or worship ''per se,'' of the consecrated elements was not commanded by Christ. It also stated that those who receive unworthily do not actually receive Christ but rather their own condemnation.\n\nAnglicans generally and officially believe in the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specifics of belief regarding the manner of His presence range from a belief in the [[Anglican_eucharistic_theology#Corporeal_presence|corporeal presence]], sometimes but not always affirming Eucharistic adoration (mainly [[Anglo-Catholics]]),<ref name=\"Poulson1999\">{{cite book|last=Poulson|first=Christine|title=The Quest for the Grail: Arthurian Legend in British Art, 1840\u20131920|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0719055379|page=40|quote=By the late 1840s Anglo-Catholic interest in the revival of ritual had given new life to doctrinal debate over the nature of the Eucharist.

Christ is risen and is alive here and now, not just remembered for what was done in the past.\n\nThis affirmation of Real Presence can be seen clearly illustrated in the language of the United Methodist Eucharistic Liturgy (for example: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090417073138/http://www.revneal.org/communionlit1.html Word and Table 1]) where, in the epiclesis of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Great Thanksgiving]], the celebrating minister prays over the elements:\n\n{{cquote|Pour out your Holy Spirit on us gathered here, and on these gifts of bread and wine. Make them be for us the body and blood of Christ that we may be for the world the body of Christ, redeemed by his blood.}}\n\nMethodists, in affrming the Real Presence, assert that Jesus is really present, and that the way He is present is a \"Holy Mystery\"; the celebrating minister will pray for the Holy Spirit to make the elements \"be the body and blood of Christ\", and the congregation will \\sing, as in the third stanza of [[Charles Wesley|Charles Wesley's]] hymn ''Come Sinners to the Gospel Feast'':\n\n<blockquote>\n\n: Come and partake the gospel feast,\n: Be saved from sin, in Jesus rest;\n: O taste the goodness of our God,\n: and eat his flesh and drink his blood.<ref>[[Wikisource:Come, Sinners, to the Gospel Feast (version 2)]]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn churches of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], the presider says the following when he individually delivers the Eucharistic elements to each of the faithful:<ref name=\"AWMC2014\"/>\n\n{{quotation|The body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy soul and body unto everlasting life.

Of the Sacraments.|Westminster Confession of Faith Ch. XXVII Sec. 7]]</ref> The elements are spiritual nourishment in Christ by faith. According to John Calvin,\n\n:The sum is, that the flesh and blood of Christ feed our souls just as bread and wine maintain and support our corporeal life. For there would be no aptitude in the sign, did not our souls find their nourishment in Christ. [...] I hold...that the sacred mystery of the Supper consists of two things\u2014the corporeal signs, which, presented to the eye, represent invisible things in a manner adapted to our weak capacity, and the spiritual truth, which is at once figured and exhibited by the signs.<ref name=\"Calvin\">Calvin, [[Institutes of the Christian Religion]], book 4, chapter 17, points 10\u201311 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xviii.html]</ref>\n\nFollowing a phrase of Augustine, the Calvinist view is that \"no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith.\" \"The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God's elect believers\", Calvin said.  Faith, not a mere mental apprehension, and the work of the Holy Spirit, are necessary for the partaker to behold God incarnate, and in the same sense touch Christ with their hands; so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ's actual presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>  The 'experience' of Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper, has traditionally been spoken of in the following way: the faithful believers are 'lifted up' by the power of the Holy Spirit to feast with Christ in heaven.  The Lord's Supper in this way is truly a 'Spiritual' experience as the Holy Spirit is directly involved in the action of 'eucharist'.\n\nThe Calvinist/Reformed view also places great emphasis on the action of the community as the Body of Christ.  As the faith community participates in the action of celebrating the Lord's Supper they are 'transformed' into the Body of Christ, or 'reformed' into the Body of Christ each time they participate in this sacrament.  In this sense it has been said that the term \"transubstantiation\" can be applied to the Faith Community (the Church) itself being transformed into the real Body and Blood of Christ truly present in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAlthough Calvin rejected adoration of the Eucharistic bread and wine as \"idolatry\" later Reformed Christians have argued otherwise. Leftover elements may be disposed of without ceremony (or reused in later services); they are unchanged, and as such the meal directs attention toward Christ's bodily resurrection and return.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>\n\nChristians in the [[Presbyterian Church U.S.A.]] and some Christians in the [[United Church of Christ]] would reverently endorse this view.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTheology in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] branch of this tradition is in flux, and recent agreements between these denominations and the [[Lutheran]]s have stressed that: \"The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, p. 66).\" Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the Real Presence, the churches have written:\n::\"During the Reformation both Reformed and Lutheran Churches exhibited an evangelical intention when they understood the Lord's Supper in the light of the saving act of God in Christ. Despite this common intention, different terms and concepts were employed which. . . led to mutual misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Properly interpreted, the differing terms and concepts were often complementary rather than contradictory (Marburg Revisited, pp. 103\u2013104);\"\n:and further:\n::\"In the Lord's Supper the risen Christ imparts himself in body and blood, given up for all, through his word of promise with bread and wine....we proclaim the death of Christ through which God has reconciled the world with himself. We proclaim the presence of the risen Lord in our midst. Rejoicing that the Lord has come to us, we await his future coming in glory....Both of our communions, we maintain, need to grow in appreciation of our diverse eucharistic traditions, finding mutual enrichment in them. At the same time both need to grow toward a further deepening of our common experience and expression of the [[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]] of our Lord's Supper.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A Formula of Agreement|url=http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Office-of-the-Presiding-Bishop/Ecumenical-and-Inter-Religious-Relations/Full-Communion-Partners/Presbyterian-Church-USA/A-Formula-of-Agreement.aspx}}</ref>\n\n=== Presbyterian Church ===\nAccording to the Presbyterian mission doctrine, the Lord's Supper is considered \"a sacrament of continuous growth, nourishment and new life\". In their understanding of the Reformed tradition, the participation in this sacrament should follow the sacrament of baptism. Just as humans need food and drink for nurture and sustenance, Calvin wrote that the Holy Meal of Lord's Supper is God's way of providing for the maintenance of sinful humans during the whole course of their lives after they have been received into God's family, in what Presbyterians call \"the Covenant Community\".<ref>David McKay \u2013 [https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant-community/ Covenant Community] \u2013 ''ligonier.org.''

Retrieved December 23, 2019.</ref>\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church]] quotes the words of John Calvin \u201ca testimony of divine grace toward us, confirmed by an outward sign, with mutual attestation of our piety toward [God].\u201d According to them, a sacrament is a testimony of God's favor toward the church, confirmed by an outward sign, with a mutual testifying of man's godliness toward God. It is a primal physical act in the Church that signifies a spiritual relationship between personal beings.  And this is what the Eucharist is in Presbyterian understanding.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nAccording to Presbyterian Eucharistic theology, there's not actual \"transubstantiation\" in the bread and wine, but that Jesus is spiritually present in the elements of the Eucharist, authentically present in the non-atom-based substance, with which they believe that he is [[Consubstantiality|con-substantial]] with God in the [[Trinity]].   They teach that Christ is genuinely there in the elements of the Lord's Supper to be received by them, and not just in their memories.    So that it is both a memorial and a presence of Christ.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nThey teach that receiving the Communion elements is taking the symbolic representation of the broken body and shed blood of Jesus into the inmost being, receiving the Jesus who died for our forgiveness and transformation. That humans depend on these elements for their very life and salvation.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nPresbyterians believe that the Word of God should be read, proclaimed and enacted in the Lord's Supper as an integral part of worship. The relationship of Word and Sacrament can be understood in the context of the Emmaus Road narrative (Luke 24:13ff). While there are various interpretations of this account, the Presbyterian Church interprets the \u201cbreaking of bread\u201d in Luke 24 as  a reference to the Lord's Supper.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nMany Presbyterian churches use unfermented grape juice for Communion, which is of relatively recent practice, starting in the late 19th century or in the past one hundred years, out of concern for drunkenness and also because some congregants view any alcohol as \"sinful\", so to accommodate their consciences grape juice is utilized in most Presbyterian churches instead.  But  recently some individual Presbyterian churches have gone back to using actual fermented wine as Christ used and commanded.  Noting that wine in itself is not sinful, but that Christ made and drank it, etc., and that only excessive drinking of wine and actual drunkenness are wrong and sinful.<ref>Jack Lash \u2013 [https://www.gpcweb.org/why-do-we-use-wine-in-communion- Why Do We Use Wine in Communion? ] Gainsevill Presbyterian Church, PCA. Retrieved December 23, 2019.</ref>  \n\nThe Directory for Worship in the Presbyterian [[Book of Order]] encourages the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of frequent celebrations of the Lord's Supper. A few Presbyterian congregations have begun celebrations of the sacrament as often as each Lord's Day (or Sunday) and on other occasions of special significance in the life of the Christian community. And also on Presbyterian \"liturgical seasons\", such as \"Holy Week\" and \"Easter\", the Lord's Supper is especially celebrated and observed in Presbyterian churches.<ref>[https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/worship/faq/faq-christianyear/ The Christian Year] - \"What are the liturgical seasons?\" ''PresbyterianMission.org.'' Retrieved January 27, 2020.</ref> But frequency alone is not the basic issue in Presbyterianism. Some believe that they need to restore the Biblical pattern of the Lord's Supper on each Sunday to provide a disciplined reminder of a divine act that will help centralize and \u201cre-focus\u201d the rhythm of people's daily lives.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\n===Baptist Churches===\n[[Reformed Baptists]], in agreement with Presbyterians and other Reformed Churches, hold to the doctrine of [[Pneumatic presence]]. The doctrine is articulated in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith]] and the [[Keach's Catechism|Catechism]]. It holds that the Lord's Supper to be a means of \"spiritual nourishment and growth\", stating:<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\"/>\n{{quote|The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the world the sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\">{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Anthony R.|last2=Thompson|first2=Philip E.|title=Baptist Sacramentalism|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781597527439|page=182}}</ref>}}\n\nIndependent Baptists hold to the [[Eucharist#Fundamental Independent Baptist (Hyles typology): Relational Presence|Relational Presence]]\n\nThe [[American Baptist Churches USA]], a mainline Baptist denomination, believes that \"The bread and cup that symbolize the broken body and shed blood offered by Christ remind us today of God's great love for us...\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417142835/http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Zwinglianism ===\n{{Main article|Memorialism}}\n\nSome Protestant groups regard the Eucharist (also called the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Table) as a symbolic meal, a [[Memorialism|memorial]] of the Last Supper and the Passion in which nothing miraculous occurs. This view is known as the Zwinglian view, after Huldrych Zwingli, a Church leader in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It is commonly associated with the United Church of Christ, Baptists, the [[Disciples of Christ]] and the [[Mennonite]]s. Elements left over from the service may be discarded without any formal ceremony, or if feasible may be retained for use in future services.\n\nThe successor of Zwingli in Zurich, [[Heinrich Bullinger]], came to an agreement theologically with John Calvin. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002220509/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Tigurinus/tigur-bvd.htm Consensus Tigurinus] lays out an explanation of the doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and specifically, that of Holy Communion, as the view embraced by John Calvin and leaders of the Church of Zurich who followed Zwingli. It demonstrates that at least the successors of Zwingli held to the real spiritual presence view most commonly attributed to Calvin and Reformed [[Protestantism]].\n\nThe [[Plymouth Brethren]] hold the Lord's Supper, or the Breaking of Bread, instituted in the upper room on Christ's betrayal night, to be the weekly remembrance feast enjoined on all true Christians. They celebrate the supper in utmost simplicity. Among \"closed\" Brethren assemblies usually any one of the brothers gives thanks for the loaf and the cup. In conservative \"open\" Brethren assemblies usually two different brothers give thanks, one for the loaf and the other for the cup. In liberal \"open\" Brethren assemblies (or churches/community chapels, etc.) sisters also participate with audible prayer.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\nThe [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] views the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper as symbolically representing and commemorating the sinless body and blood of the [[Messiah|Messiah Jesus]], the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]].  They don't consider that the elements become supernaturally altered, or that Christ's actual physical presence is literally in the bread and wine per se, but that the elements (which they generally call \"emblems\") are commemorative and symbolic, and are consecrated for the Lord's Supper observance, and are figurative of the body and blood of Christ, as the true \"[[Passover Lamb|Lamb of God]]\" who died once for all, and view the celebration as an anti-typical fulfillment of the ancient [[Jewish Passover]] celebration, which memorialized the freeing and rescuing of God's covenant people [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] from painful bondage to sinful Egypt.   The Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,<ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient [[Jewish calendar]].<ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> They refer to this observance generally as \"the Lord's Evening Meal\" or the \"Memorial of Christ's Death\", taken from Jesus' words to his Apostles \"do this as a memorial of me\". (Luke 22:19)<ref>[https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers \u2013 Luke 22] \"This do in remembrance of me.\u2014Literally, ''as My memorial,'' or, ''as your memorial of Me.''\" \u2013 Retrieved October 18, 2019.</ref>  They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.<ref>\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, p. 8, \"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians\u2014the Memorial of his death.\"</ref>\n\nOf those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, with glorified bodies, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the \"anointed\" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized \"[[other sheep]]\" of Christ's flock, or the \"[[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'other sheep' and the 'great crowd'|great crowd]]\", also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving salvation, through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is memorialized by the Lord's Evening Meal, and with the hope of obtaining everlasting life in Paradise restored on a prophesied \"[[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]]\", under Christ as Redeemer and Ruler.<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \"emblems\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms and representations, denoting what was used in the first Lord's Supper, and which figuratively represent the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and sacred realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>\"Discerning What We Are \u2013 At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>\n\n===Quakers===\n*primary theological development from the 17th century\n*Eucharistic theology: suspension/[[Memorialism]]\n*\"The bread and wine remind us of Jesus' body and blood.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316024210/http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |archive-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Quakers understand all of life as being sacramental and thus do not practice baptism or holy communion. \"We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and in communion with that Spirit.

It is viewed as a renewal of the covenant made at [[baptism]], which is to take upon oneself the name of Jesus. As such, it is considered efficacious only for baptized members in good standing. However, the unbaptized are not forbidden from communion, and it is traditional for children not yet baptized (baptism occurs only after the age of eight) to participate in communion in anticipation of baptism. Those who partake of the Sacrament promise always to remember Jesus and keep his commandments. The prayer also asks God the Father that each individual will be blessed with the Spirit of Christ.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|20|75|79}} (see also {{lds|Moroni|moro|4|3}}, {{lds|Moroni|moro|5|2}})</ref>\n\nThe Sacrament is offered weekly and all active members are taught to prepare to partake of each opportunity. It is considered to be a weekly renewal of a member's commitment to follow Jesus Christ, and a plea for forgiveness of sins.\n\nThe Latter Day Saints do not believe in any kind of literal presence. They view the bread and water as symbolic of the body and blood of Christ. Currently [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses water instead of wine. Early in their history the Sacrament wine was often purchased from enemies of the church. To remove any opportunity for poisoned or unfit wine for use in the Sacrament, it is believed a revelation from the Lord was given that stated \"it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory\u2014remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\"<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|27|2}}</ref> After this time water was permitted in place of wine, but the church continued to use wine for the sacrament until the early 20th century. As the church's prohibition on alcohol became solidified in the early 20th century, water became the liquid of choice for the Sacrament, although in situations where clean water and/or fresh bread is unavailable the closest equivalent may be used.\n\n=== Seventh-day Adventists ===\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventists]] believe that the Lord's Supper is \"a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour.\" In the communion service \"Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people.\"<ref>[[28 Fundamentals|28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Origin of the Eucharist]]\n*[[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Eucharistic discipline]]\n*[[Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Typology (theology)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borgen, Ole E.
