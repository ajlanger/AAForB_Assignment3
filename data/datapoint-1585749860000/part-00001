Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation. The first Bussey Institute building was completed in 1871 and served as headquarters for an [[undergraduate]] school of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary Jane|date=|title=Benjamin Bussey, Woodland Hill, and the Creation of the Arnold Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2006-64-1-benjamin-bussey-woodland-hill-and-the-creation-of-the-arnold-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=64(1)|pages=2-9|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June of 1872 [[Charles Sprague Sargent]] was appointed as a professor of horticulture and the curator of the Arnold Arboretum; the following year he was appointed director of both the Arnold Arboretum and the Harvard Botanic Garden.

The land was deeded to the City of Boston in 1882 and incorporated into the \"Emerald Necklace\". Under the agreement with the City, Harvard University was given a thousand-year lease on the property, and the University, as trustee, is directly responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of the Arboretum; the City retains responsibility for water fountains, benches, roads, boundaries, and policing. The annual operating budget of $7,350,644 (fiscal year 2003) is largely derived from the endowment, which is also managed by the University.  All Arboretum staff are University employees. Other income is obtained through granting agencies and contributors.\n\n==Location==\nThe main Arborway gate is located on Route 203 a few hundred yards south of its junction with the Jamaicaway. Public transportation to the Arboretum is available on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] to its terminus at [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills Station]] and by bus ([[Green Line \"E\" Branch|#39]]) to the Monument in Jamaica Plain. The Arboretum is within easy walking distance from either of these points.  The Arboretum's southwest gate is very close to the turn between Weld and Walter Streets on the [[51 (MBTA bus)|#51 bus line]] between Cleveland Circle/Reservoir and Forest Hills. The Centre Street entrance, across from Whitcomb Ave and Westchester Road, is served by the [[38 (MBTA bus)|#38 bus]].\n\n==Hours==\n[[File:Arboretum Headquarters.JPG|thumb|Hunnewell Building, Arnold Arboretum]]\nThe grounds are open free of charge to the public from sunrise to sunset 365 days of the year.\nThe Visitor's Center in the Hunnewell Building, 125 Arborway, is open November through March, noon-4:00pm; April through October, 11:00am\u20136:00pm; closed Wednesdays.

The Arboretum is located in USDA hardiness zone 6b (0 to &minus;5&nbsp;\u00b0F, &minus;18 to &minus;21&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n==Collections (as of February 2011)==\nAt present, the living collections include 14,980 individual plants (including nursery holdings) belonging to 10,117 accessions representing 3,924 taxa; with particular emphasis on the [[woody plant|ligneous]] species of [[North America]] and eastern [[Asia]]. Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], [[Ernest Henry Wilson]], [[William Purdom]], [[Joseph Hers]], and [[Joseph Rock]]. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962. They comprise four service [[greenhouse]]s totaling 3,744 square feet (348 m\u00b2), the headhouse with offices, cold rooms, storage areas, and a classroom. Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October.

Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation.

The land was deeded to the City of Boston in 1882 and incorporated into the \"Emerald Necklace\". Under the agreement with the City, Harvard University was given a thousand-year lease on the property, and the University, as trustee, is directly responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of the Arboretum; the City retains responsibility for water fountains, benches, roads, boundaries, and policing. The annual operating budget of $7,350,644 (fiscal year 2003) is largely derived from the endowment, which is also managed by the University.  All Arboretum staff are University employees. Other income is obtained through granting agencies and contributors.\n\n==Location==\nThe main Arborway gate is located on Route 203 a few hundred yards south of its junction with the Jamaicaway. Public transportation to the Arboretum is available on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] to its terminus at [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills Station]] and by bus ([[Green Line \"E\" Branch|#39]]) to the Monument in Jamaica Plain. The Arboretum is within easy walking distance from either of these points.  The Arboretum's southwest gate is very close to the turn between Weld and Walter Streets on the [[51 (MBTA bus)|#51 bus line]] between Cleveland Circle/Reservoir and Forest Hills.

Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], [[Ernest Henry Wilson]], [[William Purdom]], [[Joseph Hers]], and [[Joseph Rock]]. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962. They comprise four service [[greenhouse]]s totaling 3,744 square feet (348 m\u00b2), the headhouse with offices, cold rooms, storage areas, and a classroom. Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October. During the winter months the bonsai are held in the cold storage unit at temperatures slightly above freezing.\n\n==Isabella Welles Hunnewell Internship Program==\n[[File:Arnold Arboretum - Aug 2005 (c).JPG|thumb|right|upright|General view of Arnold Arboretum]]The Living Collections Department of the Arnold Arboretum offers a paid summer internship Program <ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/programs/intern.html Collections Internships & Fellowships]</ref> that combines hands-on training in horticulture with educational courses.\n\nThe Hunnewell Internship Program was endowed in 2003 by the descendants of [[H.
