(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2019. This was the first season with new host and former winner, [[Rik van de Westelaken]]. The season took place in [[Colombia]], the eighth country, and seventh season the series had filmed in the [[Americas]], following [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and the [[United States]] respectively. The season premiered on January 5, 2019. Live Finale aired on March 9, 2019 with simulcast in cinemas throughout the Netherlands. During the Finale, Sarah Chronis was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac10,150.-. Chronis, alongside her runner-up Niels Littooij, had successfully unmasked Merel Westrik as the Mole of 2019.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Colombia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJokers, collectible tokens in the series that could correct wrong answers in test, were adapted with for this season. Throughout the season, any Jokers the candidates earned in assignments could be split open to potentially find an Exemption. However, if a Joker is split open, they become void regardless of holding an Exemption or not. Another twist occurred later in the season, where the candidates could gamble in an assignment to earn Jokers or have their next test time reduced to one second. The risk was that they could lose money for the pot, or if they're unlucky enough, two candidates would be executed from the game at the next Execution Ceremony. Some of the candidates lost in their gamble, which caused the second instance in the series' history where two candidates were executed from the game in the same Execution ceremony, the last of which occurred in Season 5.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Merel Westrik]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|[[Sarah Chronis]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Nielson|Niels Littooij]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Sinan Can|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Rick Paul van Mulligen|nl}}\n|rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|rowspan=2|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jamie Trenit\u00e9|nl}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob\u00e8rt van Beckhoven|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Evelien de Bruijn|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|8\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[NikkieTutorials|Nikkie de Jager]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|5\n|8th place\n|-\n|[[Evi Hanssen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|9th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Attached to the bridge by rope were 15 chests being dragged by the river current. Ten of these chests held an Exemption for each of the candidates. In 20 minutes, the candidates must retrieve as many chests out of the river and onto the bridge.\n\nAfter the assignment was over, Rik approached the candidates with an offer. \u20ac2,500.- for the group's pot in exchange for all the exemptions the group managed to retrieve in the assignment. Rik also informed the group that if the non-exempt candidates all receive Green Screens, then everyone would proceed to the next episode. The candidates would only find out who had earned exemptions at the first Execution ceremony, if they reject Rik's offer.\n\nThe group rejected Rik's offer at the Execution ceremony, and it was revealed that Evelien, Evi, Merel, and Nikkie were the candidates to receive exemptions.

Rik informed the group to pay attention to the next performance, during which the candidates were brought in to dance with the performers. After the performance had finished, Rik instructed the candidates that they had a minute to tap their partner that they just danced with. For every correct match, the group would earn \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac1,000.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Rondje Om De Kerk' (Around the Church) - Max. \u20ac1,800.-\nHidden throughout the town of Santa Fe were five envelopes with a combined total of \u20ac1,800.- for the candidates to find. Using bicycles, they must cycle around the town to find the envelopes. Each bicycle had a tablet attached behind the seat, which displayed the location of the envelopes, which candidates needed to be at the envelope when its collected, and at what time. The tablets would only display the information while their respective bicycles are moving. Any envelopes that are collected by the wrong candidates or at the wrong time do not add money to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 2 - Uitgerekend===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 2 - Uitgerekend\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 12 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Scattered around the courtyard are barrels with questions based upon their personal information. Eight candidates must manoeuvre a large wooden block over a board to reveal the numerical answer to each question. The remaining two candidates are stationed on a tower above the courtyard and must take photos of each answer the group presents to them.

(Waiting Room?) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nThe candidates are dividing up into two rooms of duos, and two rooms of trios at the [[University of Antioquia]] and to watch films on one screen, and live feeds of the other rooms on a second screen. The films are recordings of the candidates' confessionals where the production had made a series of offers to them. Intervals between confessionals saw offers appear on the film screen offering money for the pot, or Jokers. Each rooms' offers differed from one another, but the candidates could not contact the other rooms during the assignment outside of the livefeeds. Once a candidate has left their room, they are out of the assignment and can not accept any other offers in the assignment. If the candidates remain in their rooms until the end of the film, they lose \u20ac250.- per candidate still watching.\n\n\u20ac250.- was removed from the pot.\n\nAfter the assignments, Rik informed the candidates that some of the Jokers this season had exemptions hidden inside of them. At any point, they could use a chisel and hammer to split open their Joker to find out if they held an Exemption. If they break their Joker, the Joker becomes void regardless of its contents or lack thereof.\n\n===Episode 3 - Niet Gered===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 3 - Niet Gered\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 19 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Rik assigns each of the group a word in Spanish to help with the assignment. Evelien and Jamie, two candidates who were fluent in Spanish, were removed from the group for the assignment. Rik asks them to predict if the rest of the group will fill up six or more clothing lines, or five or less. If Evelien and Jamie guess correctly, the group earns \u20ac1,500.- for the pot.\n\nEvelien and Jamie guessed incorrectly and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Jokers Buyout'\nBefore the start of Stapelgek, Rik offered a single Joker to the candidates for \u20ac2,000.- from the pot, or it could be free. If the group manages to decide who receives the Joker within two minutes, nothing is removed from the pot.\n\nThe group selected Niels to receive the Joker, therefore nothing was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Stapelgek' (Crazy)\nAfter Niels accepts the Joker from Rik, he is instructed to separate himself from the rest of the candidates for the remainder of the assignment at [[Plaza Mayor, Medell\u00edn|Plaza Mayor]]. The rest must compete against each other in a match of [[Jenga]] to earn Jokers. Taking turns, each candidate must build their jokers by taking out pieces from their Jenga towers. The candidate that ends up causing their match's Jenga tower to fall, loses all Jokers they could have earned while the winner keeps theirs. Three corresponding pieces make a set of Jokers, ranging from one to three. The assignment ends when the last match is complete.\n\n;'Op Treden' (Performance) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nTaken to an abandoned Trainyard, the candidates are shown a giant 3D wooden puzzle standing before a series of barriers. The goal is for the 3D puzzle to be carried through the barriers and rebuild on the opposite side for one candidate to climb upon and claim the money. Rik gives the candidates the option to complete the assignment in under 45 minutes for \u20ac1,500.- or under 30 minutes for \u20ac2,500.-.\n\nThe group accomplished the assignment under 27 minutes, despite going for the 45-minute time limit. \u20ac1,500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 4 - Drukker Worden===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 4 - Drukker Worden\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 26 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]] - [[Guatap\u00e9|Guatap\u00e9, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

The other three duos are locked in caged that are towed along the lake from the start to finish. The caged duos have 35 minutes to escape their cages and return to the green start flags to earn money for the pot. If a caged duo either cannot escape before they are towed across the red finish line, or once freed return through the red finish flags, the amount their boat is worth is removed from the pot. The longer time spent in the cages before being freed, the higher amount of money the caged boats are worth. The rescue boat duo had to relay the codes on the outside of the cages to the caged duos.\n\n\u20ac500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Serenade' - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nArriving at their Hotel in San Gil, the candidates were placed across four different floors.

Each group were given envelopes with photographs of the locations to find the puzzle pieces. If the candidates manage to find all the pieces and solve the puzzles in 45 minutes, the candidates will accomplish the assignment.\n\n\u20ac1,800.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Parkeergeld' (Parking Fee)\nReturning to a driving school in San Gil, the candidates are shown seven training cars with letters on their roofs, with accompanying parking bays. With two candidates stationed in a tower above the school's courtyard, the group must make five, six, and seven-letter words in the parking bays. Five-letter words earned \u20ac50.-; six-letter words earned \u20ac100.-; and seven-letter words earned \u20ac200.- for the pot.

At the beginning of the assignment, each candidate must select two envelopes to carry with them. If they each arrive in time at Rik's location, whatever is in their envelopes is added to the pot. If they don't, the contents in the envelopes is removed from the pot. An additional restriction is that two candidates can only make left turns, another two could only make right turns, and the last two could only make left-right turns in that order. After the first 15 minutes, the candidates had to stop where they were, and wait for Rik's second location to repeat the assignment for another 15 minutes. All valid envelopes at the end of both assignments adds to the pot, and all invalid envelopes removes money from the pot.\n\n\u20ac100.- was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Reddingslijn' (Lifeline)\nAfter writing the test, Rik instructed the candidates to split into two sets of trios, informing them that each trio could prevent the other from seeing their results for the test. Hanging across a zipline above San Gil, each candidate had to cross the zipline and take note of the sequence of red and green screens along the line. At the end of their trio's respective zipline the candidates had to replicate the zipline sequence. If a trio were successful in replicating their group's sequence, the other trio would be exempt from the Execution. Again, Sinan pulled out of the assignment due to concerns for his safety due to his weight, and Niels refused based on his fear of heights, leaving both trios down a candidate to complete the assignment\n\nBoth teams succeeded in remembering their zipline sequence, and cancelled the episode's Execution ceremony.\n\n===Episode 7 - Inhalen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Inhalen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 16 February 2019<br>Locations: [[Barichara|Barichara, Colombia]] - [[Santa Marta|Santa Marta, Colombia]] - [[Dibulla, La Guajira|Dibulla, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Some of the boxes have money for the pot, while others have other temptations. Before they are allowed to walk the route, Rik gives them a choice between one, two and three Jokers or the ability to have their upcoming test's time be reduced to one second. Choosing one of the four options meant the candidate had to take with them one, two, three or four envelopes with misfortunes, respectively. These envelopes contain \u20ac0.-; -\u20ac500.-; -\u20ac1,000.-; or there will be two Executions at the upcoming test. Once their choice is made, the corresponding positive and negative letters are randomly placed along the route amidst the money for the pot.

Across a deserted stretch of beach are oil barrels with money totaling up to \u20ac2,000.- attached to the tops. Using a drone, one of the candidates can assist in directing the others to the correct barrels to collect the money. While the candidates are out in the field, they are tracked down by hunters. Any money in a candidate's possession is removed from the assignment if they are caught by the hunters outside of the safe zone.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2019. This was the first season with new host and former winner, [[Rik van de Westelaken]]. The season took place in [[Colombia]], the eighth country, and seventh season the series had filmed in the [[Americas]], following [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and the [[United States]] respectively. The season premiered on January 5, 2019. Live Finale aired on March 9, 2019 with simulcast in cinemas throughout the Netherlands. During the Finale, Sarah Chronis was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac10,150.-. Chronis, alongside her runner-up Niels Littooij, had successfully unmasked Merel Westrik as the Mole of 2019.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Colombia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJokers, collectible tokens in the series that could correct wrong answers in test, were adapted with for this season. Throughout the season, any Jokers the candidates earned in assignments could be split open to potentially find an Exemption. However, if a Joker is split open, they become void regardless of holding an Exemption or not. Another twist occurred later in the season, where the candidates could gamble in an assignment to earn Jokers or have their next test time reduced to one second. The risk was that they could lose money for the pot, or if they're unlucky enough, two candidates would be executed from the game at the next Execution Ceremony. Some of the candidates lost in their gamble, which caused the second instance in the series' history where two candidates were executed from the game in the same Execution ceremony, the last of which occurred in Season 5.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Merel Westrik]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|[[Sarah Chronis]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Nielson|Niels Littooij]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Sinan Can|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Rick Paul van Mulligen|nl}}\n|rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|rowspan=2|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jamie Trenit\u00e9|nl}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob\u00e8rt van Beckhoven|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Evelien de Bruijn|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|8\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[NikkieTutorials|Nikkie de Jager]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|5\n|8th place\n|-\n|[[Evi Hanssen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|9th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Attached to the bridge by rope were 15 chests being dragged by the river current. Ten of these chests held an Exemption for each of the candidates. In 20 minutes, the candidates must retrieve as many chests out of the river and onto the bridge.\n\nAfter the assignment was over, Rik approached the candidates with an offer. \u20ac2,500.- for the group's pot in exchange for all the exemptions the group managed to retrieve in the assignment. Rik also informed the group that if the non-exempt candidates all receive Green Screens, then everyone would proceed to the next episode. The candidates would only find out who had earned exemptions at the first Execution ceremony, if they reject Rik's offer.\n\nThe group rejected Rik's offer at the Execution ceremony, and it was revealed that Evelien, Evi, Merel, and Nikkie were the candidates to receive exemptions. The group earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'In Zicht' (In Sight) - Max. \u20ac1,000.-\nThe candidates arrived at a public square with a large group of Salsa dancers performing. Rik informed the group to pay attention to the next performance, during which the candidates were brought in to dance with the performers. After the performance had finished, Rik instructed the candidates that they had a minute to tap their partner that they just danced with. For every correct match, the group would earn \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac1,000.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Rondje Om De Kerk' (Around the Church) - Max. \u20ac1,800.-\nHidden throughout the town of Santa Fe were five envelopes with a combined total of \u20ac1,800.- for the candidates to find. Using bicycles, they must cycle around the town to find the envelopes. Each bicycle had a tablet attached behind the seat, which displayed the location of the envelopes, which candidates needed to be at the envelope when its collected, and at what time. The tablets would only display the information while their respective bicycles are moving. Any envelopes that are collected by the wrong candidates or at the wrong time do not add money to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 2 - Uitgerekend===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 2 - Uitgerekend\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 12 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Scattered around the courtyard are barrels with questions based upon their personal information. Eight candidates must manoeuvre a large wooden block over a board to reveal the numerical answer to each question. The remaining two candidates are stationed on a tower above the courtyard and must take photos of each answer the group presents to them. For every correct and readable answer presented to Rik, \u20ac150.- is added to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Uit Stralen' (Out Shine) - Max. \u20ac3,500.-\nThe annual Laser game assignment, one by one, each candidate must navigate through a laser labyrinth, traversing on balance beams to safety platforms to pick up money that is assigned to them. The candidates have ten minutes in the labyrinth, however, if they are struck by a laser, them and the money they collect are out of the assignment.\n\n\u20ac650.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Wachtkamer?' (Waiting Room?) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nThe candidates are dividing up into two rooms of duos, and two rooms of trios at the [[University of Antioquia]] and to watch films on one screen, and live feeds of the other rooms on a second screen. The films are recordings of the candidates' confessionals where the production had made a series of offers to them. Intervals between confessionals saw offers appear on the film screen offering money for the pot, or Jokers. Each rooms' offers differed from one another, but the candidates could not contact the other rooms during the assignment outside of the livefeeds. Once a candidate has left their room, they are out of the assignment and can not accept any other offers in the assignment. If the candidates remain in their rooms until the end of the film, they lose \u20ac250.- per candidate still watching.\n\n\u20ac250.- was removed from the pot.\n\nAfter the assignments, Rik informed the candidates that some of the Jokers this season had exemptions hidden inside of them. At any point, they could use a chisel and hammer to split open their Joker to find out if they held an Exemption. If they break their Joker, the Joker becomes void regardless of its contents or lack thereof.\n\n===Episode 3 - Niet Gered===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 3 - Niet Gered\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 19 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Rik assigns each of the group a word in Spanish to help with the assignment. Evelien and Jamie, two candidates who were fluent in Spanish, were removed from the group for the assignment. Rik asks them to predict if the rest of the group will fill up six or more clothing lines, or five or less. If Evelien and Jamie guess correctly, the group earns \u20ac1,500.- for the pot.\n\nEvelien and Jamie guessed incorrectly and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Jokers Buyout'\nBefore the start of Stapelgek, Rik offered a single Joker to the candidates for \u20ac2,000.- from the pot, or it could be free. If the group manages to decide who receives the Joker within two minutes, nothing is removed from the pot.\n\nThe group selected Niels to receive the Joker, therefore nothing was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Stapelgek' (Crazy)\nAfter Niels accepts the Joker from Rik, he is instructed to separate himself from the rest of the candidates for the remainder of the assignment at [[Plaza Mayor, Medell\u00edn|Plaza Mayor]]. The rest must compete against each other in a match of [[Jenga]] to earn Jokers. Taking turns, each candidate must build their jokers by taking out pieces from their Jenga towers. The candidate that ends up causing their match's Jenga tower to fall, loses all Jokers they could have earned while the winner keeps theirs. Three corresponding pieces make a set of Jokers, ranging from one to three. The assignment ends when the last match is complete.\n\n;'Op Treden' (Performance) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nTaken to an abandoned Trainyard, the candidates are shown a giant 3D wooden puzzle standing before a series of barriers. The goal is for the 3D puzzle to be carried through the barriers and rebuild on the opposite side for one candidate to climb upon and claim the money. Rik gives the candidates the option to complete the assignment in under 45 minutes for \u20ac1,500.- or under 30 minutes for \u20ac2,500.-.\n\nThe group accomplished the assignment under 27 minutes, despite going for the 45-minute time limit. \u20ac1,500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 4 - Drukker Worden===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 4 - Drukker Worden\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 26 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]] - [[Guatap\u00e9|Guatap\u00e9, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

The other three duos are locked in caged that are towed along the lake from the start to finish. The caged duos have 35 minutes to escape their cages and return to the green start flags to earn money for the pot. If a caged duo either cannot escape before they are towed across the red finish line, or once freed return through the red finish flags, the amount their boat is worth is removed from the pot. The longer time spent in the cages before being freed, the higher amount of money the caged boats are worth.

Hanging across a zipline above San Gil, each candidate had to cross the zipline and take note of the sequence of red and green screens along the line. At the end of their trio's respective zipline the candidates had to replicate the zipline sequence. If a trio were successful in replicating their group's sequence, the other trio would be exempt from the Execution.

Some of the boxes have money for the pot, while others have other temptations. Before they are allowed to walk the route, Rik gives them a choice between one, two and three Jokers or the ability to have their upcoming test's time be reduced to one second. Choosing one of the four options meant the candidate had to take with them one, two, three or four envelopes with misfortunes, respectively. These envelopes contain \u20ac0.-; -\u20ac500.-; -\u20ac1,000.-; or there will be two Executions at the upcoming test. Once their choice is made, the corresponding positive and negative letters are randomly placed along the route amidst the money for the pot.
