With eminent examples of realism, orientalism, impressionism, and post-impressionism, the collection offers a unique overview of French and American art in the 19th century. Highlights of the collection include: ''Juno'' (ca. 1665-1668) by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Education of the Virgin'' (1748-1752) by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], ''El Pelele'' (ca. 1791) by [[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Salome Dancing before Herod]]'' (1876) by [[Gustave Moreau]], ''Dr. Pozzi at Home'' (1881) by [[John Singer Sargent]], ''Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin'' (1889) by [[Paul Gauguin]], and ''Hospital at Saint-Remy'' (1889) by [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\n===Daumier and Contemporaries Collection===\n[[File:Hospital at Saint Remy.jpg|thumb|Vincent van Gogh.

Daumier, whose life and career spanned the 19th century, was a brilliant [[satire|satirist]] whose works offered incisive comment on the hypocrisies of bourgeois life in the French capital.<ref>{{cite book |title=Honor\u00e9 Daumier 1808-1879: The Armand Hammer Daumier Collection |date=1981 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Armand Hammer Foundation}}</ref> Daumier was an extremely prolific artist whose work spans multiple media, and as such the collection includes paintings, drawings, lithographs, and a series of bronze portrait busts; all keen examples of Daumier's mordant wit and acerbic attitude towards contemporary politics. Selections from the Daumier and Contemporaries collection are on rotating display alongside works from the Armand Hammer Collection.\n\nHighlights from the Daumier and Contemporaries Collection include Daumier's ''Le pass\u00e9 - Le present - L'avenir'' (1834), ''Un Avocat Plaidant,'' (ca. 1845) ''Nadar \u00e9levant la Photographie \u00e1 la hauteur de l'Art'' (1862), and ''Don Quixote et Sancho Panza'' (1866-1868).\n\n==Programs==\nA diverse range of free public programs are presented at the Hammer Museum six evenings a week throughout the year, including lectures, readings, symposia, film screenings, musical performances, and other events.

Housing over 7,500 works of art by the French satirist [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] (1808-1879) and other contemporary [[List of caricaturists|caricaturists]], it is the largest of its kind outside of Paris. Daumier, whose life and career spanned the 19th century, was a brilliant [[satire|satirist]] whose works offered incisive comment on the hypocrisies of bourgeois life in the French capital.<ref>{{cite book |title=Honor\u00e9 Daumier 1808-1879: The Armand Hammer Daumier Collection |date=1981 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Armand Hammer Foundation}}</ref> Daumier was an extremely prolific artist whose work spans multiple media, and as such the collection includes paintings, drawings, lithographs, and a series of bronze portrait busts; all keen examples of Daumier's mordant wit and acerbic attitude towards contemporary politics. Selections from the Daumier and Contemporaries collection are on rotating display alongside works from the Armand Hammer Collection.\n\nHighlights from the Daumier and Contemporaries Collection include Daumier's ''Le pass\u00e9 - Le present - L'avenir'' (1834), ''Un Avocat Plaidant,'' (ca. 1845) ''Nadar \u00e9levant la Photographie \u00e1 la hauteur de l'Art'' (1862), and ''Don Quixote et Sancho Panza'' (1866-1868).\n\n==Programs==\nA diverse range of free public programs are presented at the Hammer Museum six evenings a week throughout the year, including lectures, readings, symposia, film screenings, musical performances, and other events. The [[Billy Wilder]] Theater opened at the Hammer Museum in late 2006, after a $5 million gift from Audrey L. Wilder, the widow of Billy Wilder, enabled the museum to resume building a 300-seat theater left unfinished at Armand Hammer's death.<ref name=\"NYT-Sheets\"/> Its 2006 opening coincided with the centennial of Wilder's birth. The venue currently houses the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]]'s well-known [[cinematheque]] as well as the Hammer's 300 public programs a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/20125/6664/about/hammer-museum-los-angeles/ |title=Hammer Museum: About |website=[[Artinfo]] |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706191525/http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/20125/6664/about/hammer-museum-los-angeles/ |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nPopular series include a weekly meditation program, the Libros Schmibros book club, and the Hammer Conversations which place major cultural, political, and intellectual leaders in dialog with one another.
