The objective of DEPB is to neutralise the incidence of Customs duty on the import content of the export product. The neutralisation shall be provided by way of grant of duty credit against the export product. Under the DEPB, an exporter may apply for credit, as a specified percentage of FOB value of exports made in freely convertible currency.\n\nNotified on 1/4/1997, the DEPB Scheme consisted of (a) Post-export DEPB and (b) Pre-export DEPB. The pre-export DEPB scheme was abolished w.e.f. 1/4/2000. Under the post-export DEPB, which is issued after exports, the exporter is given a duty entitlement Pass Book Scheme at a pre-determined credit on the FOB value. The DEPB rates allows import of any items except the items which are otherwise restricted for [[imports]]. Items such as Gold Nibs, Gold Pen, Gold watches etc. though covered under the generic description of [[Writing implement|writing instruments]], components of writing instruments and watches are thus not eligible for benefit under the DEPB scheme.\n\nThe DEPB Rates are applied on the basis of FOB value or value cap whichever is lower. For example, if the FOB value is Rs.700/- per piece, and the value cap is Rs.500/- per piece, the DEPB rate shall be applied on Rs.500/-. The DEPB rate and the value cap shall be applicable as existing on the date of exports as defined in paragraph 15.15 of Handbook (Vol.1).\n\nDEPB Scheme is issued only on post-export basis and pre/export DEPB Scheme has been discontinued. The provisions of DEPB Scheme are mentioned in Para 4.3 and 4.3.1 to 4.3.5 of the [[International trade|Foreign Trade]] Policy or Exim Policy. One significant change in the new DEPB Scheme is that in terms of Para 4.3.5 of the Exim Policy even [[Excise|excise duty]] paid in cash on inputs used in the manufacture of export product shall be eligible for brand rate of [[duty drawback]] as per rules framed by Department of Revenue which was not mentioned in the earlier DEPB Scheme.\n\n==Benefits of DEPB Rates==\n\nThe benefit of DEPB schemes is available on the export products having extraneous material up to 8% by material up to 5% shall be ignored and the DEPB rate as notified for that export product is to be allowed.\n\n==Review of DEPB Rates==\n\nThe Government of India review<ref>[http://m.mydigitalfc.com/government-finance/depb-scheme-likely-be-extended-till-march-31-408] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711235208/http://m.mydigitalfc.com/government-finance/depb-scheme-likely-be-extended-till-march-31-408 |date=2012-07-11 }} DEPB scheme likely to be extended till March 31-Source-Financial Chronicle</ref> the DEPB rates after getting the appropriate an export import data on [[FOB (shipping)]] value of [[exports]] and  [[Cost, Insurance and Freight]] (CIF) value of inputs used in the export product, as per SION.
