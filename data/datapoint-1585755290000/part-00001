The find was unprecedented in its size (worldwide) and ushered in an age of [[oil boom|rapid regional development]] and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil-producing states in the U.S., along with [[Oklahoma]] and California; soon the nation overtook the [[Russian Empire]] as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's [[Oil Age]] as the beginning of this era in Texas.<ref>Olson (2001), p. 238</ref>\n\nThe major petroleum strikes that began the rapid growth in petroleum exploration and speculation occurred in [[Southeast Texas]], but soon reserves were found across Texas and wells were constructed in [[North Texas]],  [[East Texas]], and the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in [[West Texas]].  Although limited reserves of oil had been struck during the 19th century, the strike at [[Spindletop]] near Beaumont in 1901 gained national attention, spurring exploration and development that continued through the 1920s and beyond. Spindletop and the Joiner strike in East Texas, at the outset of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], were the key strikes that launched this era of change in the state.\n\nThis period had a transformative effect on Texas.

The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in oil production.<ref name=\"HOT: 1920s\"/> The [[Glenn Pool Oil Reserve|Glenn Pool]] strike near [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s.<ref>Maugeri (2007), p. 15.</ref> Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, it was still a major producer.<ref>Malone (1989), p. 35.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1910s and 1920s, oil exploration and production continued to expand and stabilize.

This new oil field helped to revive Dallas's economy during the Great Depression, but sharply decreased interest in West Texas as the new supply led to another major drop in oil prices. The uncontrolled production in the eastern field destabilized the state's oil industry, which had been trying to control production levels to stabilize prices.<ref name=\"Olien 2000, p. 188\"/> Overproduction in East Texas was so great that then-governor [[Ross S. Sterling|Ross Sterling]] attempted to shut down many of the wells. During one of the forced closures, he ordered the [[Texas National Guard]] to enforce the shutdown. These efforts at controlling production, intended to protect both the independent operators and the major producers, were largely unsuccessful at first and led to widespread oil smuggling. In the later 1930s, the federal government intervened and brought production to sustainable levels, leading to a stabilization of price fluctuation.<ref>Burrough (2009), p. 77</ref> The income provided by the stabilization allowed less populated West Texas and the Panhandle to be more fully explored and exploited.<ref name=\"HOT: Oil and Gas\"/>\n\n===Emergence of an industry===\n[[File:YatesOilfieldNASA.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph looking down on hilly, treeless terrain with a town to the upper right and the thin line of a river crossing up and down on the right|Satellite view of the Yates Oil Field in West Texas.

The find was unprecedented in its size (worldwide) and ushered in an age of [[oil boom|rapid regional development]] and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil-producing states in the U.S., along with [[Oklahoma]] and California; soon the nation overtook the [[Russian Empire]] as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's [[Oil Age]] as the beginning of this era in Texas.<ref>Olson (2001), p. 238</ref>\n\nThe major petroleum strikes that began the rapid growth in petroleum exploration and speculation occurred in [[Southeast Texas]], but soon reserves were found across Texas and wells were constructed in [[North Texas]],  [[East Texas]], and the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in [[West Texas]].  Although limited reserves of oil had been struck during the 19th century, the strike at [[Spindletop]] near Beaumont in 1901 gained national attention, spurring exploration and development that continued through the 1920s and beyond. Spindletop and the Joiner strike in East Texas, at the outset of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], were the key strikes that launched this era of change in the state.\n\nThis period had a transformative effect on Texas.

The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in oil production.<ref name=\"HOT: 1920s\"/> The [[Glenn Pool Oil Reserve|Glenn Pool]] strike near [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s.<ref>Maugeri (2007), p. 15.</ref> Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, it was still a major producer.<ref>Malone (1989), p. 35.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1910s and 1920s, oil exploration and production continued to expand and stabilize.

This new oil field helped to revive Dallas's economy during the Great Depression, but sharply decreased interest in West Texas as the new supply led to another major drop in oil prices. The uncontrolled production in the eastern field destabilized the state's oil industry, which had been trying to control production levels to stabilize prices.<ref name=\"Olien 2000, p. 188\"/> Overproduction in East Texas was so great that then-governor [[Ross S. Sterling|Ross Sterling]] attempted to shut down many of the wells. During one of the forced closures, he ordered the [[Texas National Guard]] to enforce the shutdown. These efforts at controlling production, intended to protect both the independent operators and the major producers, were largely unsuccessful at first and led to widespread oil smuggling. In the later 1930s, the federal government intervened and brought production to sustainable levels, leading to a stabilization of price fluctuation.<ref>Burrough (2009), p. 77</ref> The income provided by the stabilization allowed less populated West Texas and the Panhandle to be more fully explored and exploited.<ref name=\"HOT: Oil and Gas\"/>\n\n===Emergence of an industry===\n[[File:YatesOilfieldNASA.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph looking down on hilly, treeless terrain with a town to the upper right and the thin line of a river crossing up and down on the right|Satellite view of the Yates Oil Field in West Texas.

Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state would lead to a loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of [[antitrust]] lawsuits by the state [[Attorney General]] starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.<ref>Hinton (2002), p. 53-54</ref>\n\nThe mistrust of Standard Oil was partially the result of a suspicion toward ''[[carpetbaggers]]'', which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions.

The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. Parallel to this, the clearing of fields for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction, all of which followed major logging activities in the 19th century, destroyed most of the once dense forest lands in the state.<ref name=\"Jefferson County\"/><ref name=\"HOT: Lumber industry\">{{Handbook of Texas | name=Lumber Industry | id=drl02 | author=Maxwell, Robert S. | retrieved=November 6, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref><ref>Cozine (2004) pp. 52\u201358.</ref> Later environmental management efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow of what they were before statehood.\n\nIndustrial activities, which had little regulation, created substantial air pollution.
