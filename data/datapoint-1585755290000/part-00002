At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 976, up from 952 in 2000. It is on northwestern [[Popof Island]], one of the [[Shumagin Islands]], off the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It is the [[County seat|borough seat]] of Aleutians East Borough, and is near the entrance to the [[Bering Sea]].\n\nThe Aleutians East Borough School District is in Southwestern Alaska along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain The District was formed in 1988 from smaller districts that consolidated and formed a Borough with taxing authority. The Borough and District boundaries are the same, and stretch over approximately {{convert|15000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of roadless, mostly treeless tundra, from the middle of the Alaska Peninsula to the north and east, going southwest out to Akutan just east of [[Dutch Harbor]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fishing village of Sand Point, Popof Island, Alaska, nd (COBB 146).jpeg|thumb|Undated photograph of Sand Point by [[John Nathan Cobb]] (died 1930)]]\nSand Point was founded by a San Francisco fishing company in 1898 as a cod fishing station and trading post. [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s and Scandinavians were among the early residents. Gold mining was briefly a part of the economy during the early 1900s. Fishing remains an important industry, as Sand Point is home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the Aleutian Chain.\n\n==Description==\nAlmost half the inhabitants are of [[Aleut people|Aleut]] descent - mainly from the Qagan Tayagungin tribe, and support themselves by fishing and [[fish processing]]. There is a cold storage and fish-processing plant owned and operated by Trident Seafoods and Peter Pan has a support facility. There is an airport with a {{convert|5200|ft|m|sigfig=2}} paved runway and daily flights (weather permitting) to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], {{convert|575|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} to the northeast.\n\nThe town is above the [[treeline]], and there is a small herd of 120 [[bison]] (first introduced in the 1930s) which provides some meat for the island's inhabitants. It is notorious for the high winds caused by the meeting of cold air flows from the [[Bering Sea]] with the warm air over the [[Japan Current]]. It has a [[maritime climate]], with temperature averages ranging from {{convert|\u22129|to|76|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, an average snowfall of {{convert|52|in|cm}} and an average rainfall of {{convert|33|in|cm}}.\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox]] St. Nicholas Chapel was built in Sand Point in 1933.<ref name=\"communitydb\">[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Sand%20Point \"Alaska Community Database, Community Information Summaries - Sand Point\"].

More than 50% of the permanent residents in Sand Point are known as [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s or [[Unangan]]. Every July the town hosts a Culture Camp in which Aleut traditions such as dance, sewing Aleut dresses, playing drums, building kayaks, knot tying, and weaving are taught. Culture Camp has an Aleut language component built into the program.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|28.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|7.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|21.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (73.05%) is water.\n\n==Education==\nThere is one school, the Sand Point School, operated by the [[Aleutians East Borough School District]] (AEBSD).<ref>{{Cite web | title = District Schools | work = Aleutians East Borough School District | url = http://aebsdonline.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=146 | accessdate = December 21, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100526104657/http://aebsdonline.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=146 | archivedate = May 26, 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are approximately one hundred students in the Sand Point School.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}{{when|date=February 2017}} In addition to classroom space, the school houses a library media center, gymnasium, weight room, indoor pool and shop.

Often it is difficult to obtain a plane ticket off of the island with costs occasionally reaching $1200 for a round-trip ticket.\n\nCargo service to Sand Point is available on PenAir and [[Alaska Central Express]] (ACE) Air Cargo.  PenAir has cargo flights to Sand Point six mornings a week.  ACE Air Cargo flies to Sand Point several days a week.  \n[http://www.coastaltransportation.com/ ''Coastal Transportation''] is a Seattle-based marine carrier that provides weekly year-around service to communities throughout the Aleutians, including Sand Point.\n\nDuring the summer and into the fall, the Alaska Marine Highway operates the [[MV Tustumena|Tustumena]]. The Tustumena stops in Sand Point four times per month. From Sand Point the ferry goes to King Cove, Cold Bay, False Pass and Dutch Harbor. The ship has staterooms and dining room service. The ferry takes cars and trucks. As of 2017 ferry delays have been common.\n\nIn Sand Point, rental cars are available from the Harbor Cafe and the Marine View Bed & Breakfast.\n\n==Wind Power==\nIn 2012, two .5MW wind turbines were installed with blade diameters of 19.5 meters and a height of 59.5 meters.\n\n==Activities==\nMany people enjoy hunting for [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] and [[American bison|buffalo]].  [[Commercial fishing|Commercial]] and [[Recreational fishing|pole fishing]] are enjoyable pastimes for the residents of Sand Point. [[Boating]]  and riding [[all-terrain vehicle]]s (ATVs) are popular pastimes as well. There is an annual Silver Salmon Derby in which contestants try to catch the largest fish to earn a cash prize. Adults can play [[Bingo (U.S.)|Bingo]] and [[Pull-tab|pull tabs]] on Sunday. The [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] offers after-school activities.\nMany adults spend their time at the local tavern and lounge both owned and operated by the Shumagin Corporation. Due to the small community and the lack of entertainment, many newcomers find themselves leaving. This includes many of the teachers.\n\n==Fishing industry==\nLike most Aleutian communities, commercial fishing drives the local economy. The Aleutians' largest fishing fleet is based in Sand Point.<ref name=\"communitydb\" /> [[Trident Seafoods]] has a major [[Pacific cod]], [[pollock]], [[salmon]] and [[halibut]] [[Fish processing|processing plant]], and provides fuel and other services. Peter Pan Seafoods owns a storage and transfer facility. In 1991, New West Fisheries had a [[Factory ship|floating processor]] near the city dock for [[Pacific cod]] processing. Residents in Sand Point have to acquire commercial fishing permits to participate in the fisheries.\n\nThe city completed a major rehabilitation of the Robert E. Galovin Small Boat Harbor in the summer of 2014. The harbor can hold more than 150 boats in permanent slips, as well as transient vessels. There is also a new boat harbor on the waterfront next to the small boat harbor and City dock. This harbor was built by the Borough and Army Corps of Engineers, but does not have any floats.\n\n==Business and shopping==\nThe AC Store ([[Alaska Commercial Company]]) provides groceries, apparel, motorized vehicles such as ATVs, and toiletries.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 976, up from 952 in 2000. It is on northwestern [[Popof Island]], one of the [[Shumagin Islands]], off the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It is the [[County seat|borough seat]] of Aleutians East Borough, and is near the entrance to the [[Bering Sea]].\n\nThe Aleutians East Borough School District is in Southwestern Alaska along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain The District was formed in 1988 from smaller districts that consolidated and formed a Borough with taxing authority. The Borough and District boundaries are the same, and stretch over approximately {{convert|15000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of roadless, mostly treeless tundra, from the middle of the Alaska Peninsula to the north and east, going southwest out to Akutan just east of [[Dutch Harbor]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fishing village of Sand Point, Popof Island, Alaska, nd (COBB 146).jpeg|thumb|Undated photograph of Sand Point by [[John Nathan Cobb]] (died 1930)]]\nSand Point was founded by a San Francisco fishing company in 1898 as a cod fishing station and trading post. [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s and Scandinavians were among the early residents. Gold mining was briefly a part of the economy during the early 1900s. Fishing remains an important industry, as Sand Point is home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the Aleutian Chain.\n\n==Description==\nAlmost half the inhabitants are of [[Aleut people|Aleut]] descent - mainly from the Qagan Tayagungin tribe, and support themselves by fishing and [[fish processing]]. There is a cold storage and fish-processing plant owned and operated by Trident Seafoods and Peter Pan has a support facility. There is an airport with a {{convert|5200|ft|m|sigfig=2}} paved runway and daily flights (weather permitting) to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], {{convert|575|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} to the northeast.\n\nThe town is above the [[treeline]], and there is a small herd of 120 [[bison]] (first introduced in the 1930s) which provides some meat for the island's inhabitants. It is notorious for the high winds caused by the meeting of cold air flows from the [[Bering Sea]] with the warm air over the [[Japan Current]]. It has a [[maritime climate]], with temperature averages ranging from {{convert|\u22129|to|76|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, an average snowfall of {{convert|52|in|cm}} and an average rainfall of {{convert|33|in|cm}}.\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox]] St. Nicholas Chapel was built in Sand Point in 1933.<ref name=\"communitydb\">[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Sand%20Point \"Alaska Community Database, Community Information Summaries - Sand Point\"].

Often it is difficult to obtain a plane ticket off of the island with costs occasionally reaching $1200 for a round-trip ticket.\n\nCargo service to Sand Point is available on PenAir and [[Alaska Central Express]] (ACE) Air Cargo.  PenAir has cargo flights to Sand Point six mornings a week.  ACE Air Cargo flies to Sand Point several days a week.  \n[http://www.coastaltransportation.com/ ''Coastal Transportation''] is a Seattle-based marine carrier that provides weekly year-around service to communities throughout the Aleutians, including Sand Point.\n\nDuring the summer and into the fall, the Alaska Marine Highway operates the [[MV Tustumena|Tustumena]]. The Tustumena stops in Sand Point four times per month. From Sand Point the ferry goes to King Cove, Cold Bay, False Pass and Dutch Harbor. The ship has staterooms and dining room service. The ferry takes cars and trucks. As of 2017 ferry delays have been common.\n\nIn Sand Point, rental cars are available from the Harbor Cafe and the Marine View Bed & Breakfast.\n\n==Wind Power==\nIn 2012, two .5MW wind turbines were installed with blade diameters of 19.5 meters and a height of 59.5 meters.\n\n==Activities==\nMany people enjoy hunting for [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] and [[American bison|buffalo]].  [[Commercial fishing|Commercial]] and [[Recreational fishing|pole fishing]] are enjoyable pastimes for the residents of Sand Point. [[Boating]]  and riding [[all-terrain vehicle]]s (ATVs) are popular pastimes as well. There is an annual Silver Salmon Derby in which contestants try to catch the largest fish to earn a cash prize. Adults can play [[Bingo (U.S.)|Bingo]] and [[Pull-tab|pull tabs]] on Sunday. The [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] offers after-school activities.\nMany adults spend their time at the local tavern and lounge both owned and operated by the Shumagin Corporation. Due to the small community and the lack of entertainment, many newcomers find themselves leaving. This includes many of the teachers.\n\n==Fishing industry==\nLike most Aleutian communities, commercial fishing drives the local economy. The Aleutians' largest fishing fleet is based in Sand Point.<ref name=\"communitydb\" /> [[Trident Seafoods]] has a major [[Pacific cod]], [[pollock]], [[salmon]] and [[halibut]] [[Fish processing|processing plant]], and provides fuel and other services. Peter Pan Seafoods owns a storage and transfer facility. In 1991, New West Fisheries had a [[Factory ship|floating processor]] near the city dock for [[Pacific cod]] processing. Residents in Sand Point have to acquire commercial fishing permits to participate in the fisheries.\n\nThe city completed a major rehabilitation of the Robert E. Galovin Small Boat Harbor in the summer of 2014. The harbor can hold more than 150 boats in permanent slips, as well as transient vessels. There is also a new boat harbor on the waterfront next to the small boat harbor and City dock. This harbor was built by the Borough and Army Corps of Engineers, but does not have any floats.\n\n==Business and shopping==\nThe AC Store ([[Alaska Commercial Company]]) provides groceries, apparel, motorized vehicles such as ATVs, and toiletries. Small local stores provide goods like hardware, toys, groceries, and electronics. There is a small selection of restaurants in the town. Alcohol can be purchased at two locations. A [[bed and breakfast]] is near the Trident bunkhouses.
