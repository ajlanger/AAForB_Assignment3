S. Eliot]], who became a recurring intellectual foil. Bloom had a contentious approach: his first book, ''Shelley's Myth-making'', charged many contemporary critics with sheer carelessness in their reading of the poet.\n\n===Influence theory===\n\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|A lion-faced [[deity]] associated with [[Gnosticism]]. Bloom frequently referred to Gnosticism when speaking about general and personal religious matters.]]\n\nAfter a personal crisis during the late 1960s, Bloom became deeply interested in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the ancient mystic traditions of [[Gnosticism]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hermeticism]]. In a 2003 interview with Bloom, [[Michael Pakenham]], the book editor for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', posited that Bloom has long referred to himself as a \"Jewish Gnostic\". Bloom explained: \"I am using Gnostic in a very broad way. I am nothing if not Jewish... I really am a product of Yiddish culture. But I can't understand a [[Yahweh]], or a [[God]], who could be all-powerful and all knowing and would allow the [[Nazi death camps]] and [[schizophrenia]].\"<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = In Full Bloom: Guerrilla In Our Midst\n  |last = Pakenham\n  |first = Michael\n  |website = [[The Baltimore Sun]]\n  |date = March 23, 2003\n  |accessdate = September 15, 2016\n  |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-03-23/entertainment/0303240442_1_bloom-dining-room-table\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Influenced by his reading, he began a series of books that focused on the way in which poets struggled to create their own individual poetic visions without being overcome by the influence of the previous poets who inspired them to write.\n\nThe first of these books, ''Yeats'', a magisterial examination of [[William Butler Yeats|the poet]], challenged the conventional critical view of his poetic career. In the introduction to this volume, Bloom set out the basic principles of his new approach to criticism: \"Poetic influence, as I conceive it, is a variety of melancholy or the anxiety-principle.\" New poets become inspired to write because they have read and admired the poetry of previous poets; but this admiration turns into resentment when the new poets discover that these poets whom they idolized have already said everything they wish to say. The poets become disappointed because they \"cannot be [[Adam]] early in the morning. There have been too many Adams, and they have named everything.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn order to evade this psychological obstacle, according to Bloom, new poets must be convinced that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving open the possibility that they may have something to add to the tradition after all. The new poets' love for their heroes turns into antagonism towards them: \"Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible.\"<ref>''Map of Misreading'', p. 10.</ref> The book that followed ''Yeats'', ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]'', which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of [[Walter Jackson Bate]]'s ''The Burden of the Past and The English Poet'' and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by 17th and 18th-century poets about their ability to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which poets broke free from their precursors to achieve their own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between \"strong poets\" who perform \"strong misreadings\" of their precursors, and \"weak poets\" who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of \"revisionary ratios\", through which each strong poet passes in the course of their career.\n\n====Addenda and developments of his theory====\n''A Map of Misreading'' picked up where ''The Anxiety of Influence'' left off, making several adjustments to Bloom's system of revisionary ratios. ''Kabbalah and Criticism'' attempted to invoke the esoteric interpretive system of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], as explicated by scholar [[Gershom Scholem]], as an alternate system of mapping the path of poetic influence. ''Figures of Capable Imagination'' collected odd pieces Bloom had written in the process of composing his \"influence\" books.\n\nBloom continued to write about influence theory throughout the 1970s and '80s, and penned little thereafter that did not invoke his ideas about influence.\n\n===Novel experiment===\nBloom's fascination with the fantasy novel ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]] led him to take a brief break from criticism in order to compose a sequel to Lindsay's novel. This novel, ''[[The Flight to Lucifer]]'', was Bloom's only work of fiction.<ref name=\"The Violet Apple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.violetapple.org.uk/notes/bloom_flighttolucifer.php|title=The Flight to Lucifer review|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Religious criticism===\nBloom then entered a phase of what he called \"religious criticism\", beginning with ''Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present'' (1989).\n\nIn ''The Book of J'' (1990), he and [[David Rosenberg (poet)|David Rosenberg]] (who translated the Biblical texts) portrayed one of the posited ancient documents that formed the basis of the first five books of the Bible (see [[documentary hypothesis]]) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a [[dogmatic]]ally religious work (see [[Jahwist]]). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings [[David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]]\u2014a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations did not go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical [[Bathsheba]].<ref>Bloom, Harold, ''The Western Canon. The Books and Schools of the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1994, p. 5.</ref> In ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in ''The Book of J'' in discussing the significance of [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of [[Christianity and Judaism]].\n\nIn ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), Bloom surveyed the major varieties of [[Protestant]] and post-Protestant religious faiths that originated in the United States and argued that, in terms of their psychological hold on their adherents, most shared more in common with [[gnosticism]] than with historical Christianity. The exception was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whom Bloom regards as non-Gnostic. He elsewhere predicted that the [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] strains of [[American Christianity]] would overtake mainstream Protestant divisions in popularity in the next few decades. In ''Omens of Millennium'' (1996), Bloom identifies these American religious elements as on the periphery of an old \u2013 and not inherently Christian \u2013 gnostic, religious tradition which invokes a complex of ideas and experiences concerning [[angelology]], interpretation of dreams as [[prophecy]], [[near-death experience]]s, and [[millennialism]].<ref>Bloom (1996), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn his essay in ''The Gospel of Thomas'', Bloom states that none of Thomas' [[Aramaic]] sayings have survived in the original language.<ref>Bloom, Harold. \"A Reading\", in ''The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus''. English translation and critical edition of the Coptic text by Marvin W. Meyer. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992, pp. 115 and 119.</ref> [[Marvin Meyer]] generally agreed and further confirmed that the earlier versions of that text were likely written in either Aramaic or Greek.<ref>Mayer, Marvin. \"Introduction\".

Bloom asserted that the goals of reading must be solitary [[aesthetic]] pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal of improving one's society held by \"forces of resentment\". He cast the latter as an absurd aim, writing: \"The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading [[Shakespeare]] is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools.\" His position was that politics had no place in literary criticism, that a [[feminist]] or [[Marxist]] reading of ''[[Hamlet]]'' would tell us something about feminism and Marxism but probably nothing about ''Hamlet'' itself.\n\nIn addition to considering how much influence a writer had had on later writers, Bloom proposed the concept of \"canonical strangeness\" (cf. [[uncanny]]) as a benchmark of a literary work's merit. ''The Western Canon'' also included a list\u2014which aroused more widespread interest than anything else in the volume\u2014of all the Western works from antiquity to the present that Bloom considered either permanent members of the canon of literary classics, or (among more recent works) candidates for that status. Bloom said that he made the list off the top of his head at his editor's request, and that he did not stand by it.<ref name=vice />\n\n===Work on Shakespeare===\n[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]] (1564\u20131616)]]\n\nBloom had a deep appreciation for [[William Shakespeare]]<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;2\u20133.</ref> and considered him to be the supreme center of the Western canon.<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;24\u20135.</ref> The first edition of ''The Anxiety of Influence'' almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom then considered barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, added a long preface that mostly expounded Shakespeare's debt to [[Ovid]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], and his [[agon#Literature|agon]] with contemporary [[Christopher Marlowe]], who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.\n\nIn his later survey, ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (1998), Bloom provided an analysis of each of Shakespeare's 38 plays, \"twenty-four of which are masterpieces.\" Written as a companion to the general reader and theater-goer, Bloom declared that [[bardolatry]] \"ought to be even more a secular religion than it already is.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''. New York: Riverhead, 1998, p. xix.</ref> He also contended in the work (as in the title) that Shakespeare \"invented\" humanity, in that he prescribed the now-common practice of \"overhearing\" ourselves, which drives our changes. The two paragons of his theory were [[Sir John Falstaff]] of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], whom Bloom saw as representing self-satisfaction and self-loathing, respectively. Throughout ''Shakespeare'', characters from disparate plays were imagined alongside and interacting with each other. This has been decried by numerous contemporary academics and critics as harking back to the out of fashion character criticism of [[A. C. Bradley]] (and others), who gathered explicit praise in the book. As in ''The Western Canon'', Bloom criticized what he called the \"School of Resentment\" for its failure to live up to the challenge of Shakespeare's universality and for [[Balkanization|balkanizing]] the study of literature through multicultural and [[New Historicism|historicist]] departments. Asserting Shakespeare's singular popularity throughout the world, Bloom proclaimed him the only truly multicultural author. Repudiating the \"social energies\" to which historicists ascribed Shakespeare's authorship, Bloom pronounced his modern academic foes \u2013 and indeed, all of society \u2013 to be but \"a parody of Shakespearian energies.\"\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nBloom consolidated his work on the western canon with the publication of ''How to Read and Why'' (2000) and ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' (2003). ''Hamlet: Poem Unlimited'' (also 2003) is an amendment to ''Shakespeare: Invention of the Human'' written after he decided the chapter on ''Hamlet'' in that earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself. Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in ''Where Shall Wisdom Be Found'' (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2005). Throughout the decade he also compiled, edited and introduced several major anthologies of poetry.\n\nBloom took part in the documentary, the ''[[Apparition of the Eternal Church]]'' (2006), made by [[Paul Festa]]. This documentary centered on many individuals' reactions to hearing, for the first time, Olivier Messiaen's organ piece ''[[Apparition de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9ternelle]]''.\n\nBloom began a book under the working title of ''Living Labyrinth'', centering on Shakespeare and [[Walt Whitman]], which was published as ''The Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life'' (2011).\n\nIn July 2011, after the publication of ''The Anatomy of Influence'' and after finishing work on ''The Shadow of a Great Rock'', Bloom was working on three further projects:\n* ''Achievement in the Evening Land from Emerson to [[Faulkner]]'', a history of American literature following the canonical model, which ultimately developed into his book ''The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime'' (2015).\n* ''The Hum of Thoughts Evaded in the Mind: A Literary Memoir'', which ultimately developed into his book ''Possessed by Memory: The Inward Light of Criticism'' (2019).\n* a play with the working title ''Walt Whitman: A Musical Pageant''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioopensource.org/harold-bloom-on-the-playing-field-of-poetry/|title=Harold Bloom: On the Playing Field of Poetry - Open Source with Christopher Lydon|author=|date=July 5, 2011|website=www.radioopensource.org|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref> By November 2011, Bloom had changed the title of the play to ''To You Whoever You Are: A Pageant Celebrating Walt Whitman''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/will-this-election-be-the-mormon-breakthrough.html \"Will This Election Be the Mormon Breakthrough?\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|In ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'', Bloom claimed that [[Samuel Johnson]] was \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him.\"]]\n\nIn 1986, Bloom credited [[Northrop Frye]] as his nearest precursor. He told [[Imre Salusinszky]] in 1986: \"In terms of my own theorizations&nbsp;... the precursor proper has to be Northrop Frye. I purchased and read ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'' a week or two after it had come out and reached the bookstore in Ithaca, New York. It ravished my heart away. I have tried to find an alternative father in Mr. [[Kenneth Burke]], who is a charming fellow and a very powerful critic, but I don't come from Burke, I come out of Frye.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html#roots|title=Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Interviews|author=|date=|website=prelectur.stanford.edu|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in ''Anatomy of Influence'' (2011), he wrote \"I no longer have the patience to read anything by Frye\" and nominated Angus Fletcher of the City University of New York among his living contemporaries as his \"critical guide and conscience\" and elsewhere that year recommended Fletcher's ''Colors of the Mind'' and ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' by [[M. H. Abrams]]. In this late phase of his career, Bloom also emphasized the tradition of earlier critics such as [[William Hazlitt]], Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Walter Pater]], [[A. C. Bradley]], and [[Samuel Johnson]], describing Johnson in ''The Western Canon'' as \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him\". In his 2012 Foreword to the book ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012), Bloom indicated the influence which M. H. Abrams had upon him in his years at Cornell University.<ref>M. H. Abrams. ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012).</ref>\n\nBloom's theory of poetic influence regards the development of [[Western literature]] as a process of borrowing and misreading. Writers find their creative inspiration in previous writers and begin by imitating those writers in order to develop a poetic voice of their own; however, they must make their own work different from that of their precursors. As a result, Bloom argues, authors of real power must inevitably \"misread\" their precursors' works in order to make room for fresh imaginings.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2225/the-art-of-criticism-no-1-harold-bloom| title=Harold Bloom, The Art of Criticism No. 1| journal=Paris Review| volume=Spring 1991| issue=118| date=Spring 1991| author=Antonio Weiss}}</ref><ref>Paul Fry, [http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-14 \"Engl 300: Introduction To Theory Of Literature\"].

He told [[Robert Moynihan]] in 1983, \"What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through [[apophatic theology|negative theology]]&nbsp;...

S. Eliot]], who became a recurring intellectual foil. Bloom had a contentious approach: his first book, ''Shelley's Myth-making'', charged many contemporary critics with sheer carelessness in their reading of the poet.\n\n===Influence theory===\n\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|A lion-faced [[deity]] associated with [[Gnosticism]]. Bloom frequently referred to Gnosticism when speaking about general and personal religious matters.]]\n\nAfter a personal crisis during the late 1960s, Bloom became deeply interested in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the ancient mystic traditions of [[Gnosticism]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hermeticism]]. In a 2003 interview with Bloom, [[Michael Pakenham]], the book editor for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', posited that Bloom has long referred to himself as a \"Jewish Gnostic\". Bloom explained: \"I am using Gnostic in a very broad way. I am nothing if not Jewish... I really am a product of Yiddish culture. But I can't understand a [[Yahweh]], or a [[God]], who could be all-powerful and all knowing and would allow the [[Nazi death camps]] and [[schizophrenia]].\"<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = In Full Bloom: Guerrilla In Our Midst\n  |last = Pakenham\n  |first = Michael\n  |website = [[The Baltimore Sun]]\n  |date = March 23, 2003\n  |accessdate = September 15, 2016\n  |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-03-23/entertainment/0303240442_1_bloom-dining-room-table\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Influenced by his reading, he began a series of books that focused on the way in which poets struggled to create their own individual poetic visions without being overcome by the influence of the previous poets who inspired them to write.\n\nThe first of these books, ''Yeats'', a magisterial examination of [[William Butler Yeats|the poet]], challenged the conventional critical view of his poetic career. In the introduction to this volume, Bloom set out the basic principles of his new approach to criticism: \"Poetic influence, as I conceive it, is a variety of melancholy or the anxiety-principle.\" New poets become inspired to write because they have read and admired the poetry of previous poets; but this admiration turns into resentment when the new poets discover that these poets whom they idolized have already said everything they wish to say. The poets become disappointed because they \"cannot be [[Adam]] early in the morning. There have been too many Adams, and they have named everything.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn order to evade this psychological obstacle, according to Bloom, new poets must be convinced that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving open the possibility that they may have something to add to the tradition after all. The new poets' love for their heroes turns into antagonism towards them: \"Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible.\"<ref>''Map of Misreading'', p. 10.</ref> The book that followed ''Yeats'', ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]'', which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of [[Walter Jackson Bate]]'s ''The Burden of the Past and The English Poet'' and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by 17th and 18th-century poets about their ability to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which poets broke free from their precursors to achieve their own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between \"strong poets\" who perform \"strong misreadings\" of their precursors, and \"weak poets\" who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of \"revisionary ratios\", through which each strong poet passes in the course of their career.\n\n====Addenda and developments of his theory====\n''A Map of Misreading'' picked up where ''The Anxiety of Influence'' left off, making several adjustments to Bloom's system of revisionary ratios. ''Kabbalah and Criticism'' attempted to invoke the esoteric interpretive system of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], as explicated by scholar [[Gershom Scholem]], as an alternate system of mapping the path of poetic influence. ''Figures of Capable Imagination'' collected odd pieces Bloom had written in the process of composing his \"influence\" books.\n\nBloom continued to write about influence theory throughout the 1970s and '80s, and penned little thereafter that did not invoke his ideas about influence.\n\n===Novel experiment===\nBloom's fascination with the fantasy novel ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]] led him to take a brief break from criticism in order to compose a sequel to Lindsay's novel. This novel, ''[[The Flight to Lucifer]]'', was Bloom's only work of fiction.<ref name=\"The Violet Apple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.violetapple.org.uk/notes/bloom_flighttolucifer.php|title=The Flight to Lucifer review|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Religious criticism===\nBloom then entered a phase of what he called \"religious criticism\", beginning with ''Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present'' (1989).\n\nIn ''The Book of J'' (1990), he and [[David Rosenberg (poet)|David Rosenberg]] (who translated the Biblical texts) portrayed one of the posited ancient documents that formed the basis of the first five books of the Bible (see [[documentary hypothesis]]) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a [[dogmatic]]ally religious work (see [[Jahwist]]). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings [[David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]]\u2014a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations did not go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical [[Bathsheba]].<ref>Bloom, Harold, ''The Western Canon. The Books and Schools of the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1994, p. 5.</ref> In ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in ''The Book of J'' in discussing the significance of [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of [[Christianity and Judaism]].\n\nIn ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), Bloom surveyed the major varieties of [[Protestant]] and post-Protestant religious faiths that originated in the United States and argued that, in terms of their psychological hold on their adherents, most shared more in common with [[gnosticism]] than with historical Christianity. The exception was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whom Bloom regards as non-Gnostic. He elsewhere predicted that the [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] strains of [[American Christianity]] would overtake mainstream Protestant divisions in popularity in the next few decades. In ''Omens of Millennium'' (1996), Bloom identifies these American religious elements as on the periphery of an old \u2013 and not inherently Christian \u2013 gnostic, religious tradition which invokes a complex of ideas and experiences concerning [[angelology]], interpretation of dreams as [[prophecy]], [[near-death experience]]s, and [[millennialism]].<ref>Bloom (1996), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn his essay in ''The Gospel of Thomas'', Bloom states that none of Thomas' [[Aramaic]] sayings have survived in the original language.<ref>Bloom, Harold. \"A Reading\", in ''The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus''. English translation and critical edition of the Coptic text by Marvin W. Meyer. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992, pp. 115 and 119.</ref> [[Marvin Meyer]] generally agreed and further confirmed that the earlier versions of that text were likely written in either Aramaic or Greek.<ref>Mayer, Marvin. \"Introduction\". The Gospel of Thomas. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992, p. 9.</ref> Meyer ends his introduction with an endorsement of much of Bloom's essay.<ref>Meyer (1992), p. 19.</ref> Bloom notes the other-worldliness of the Jesus in the Thomas sayings by making reference to \"the paradox also of the American Jesus.\"<ref>Meyer (1992), p. 119.</ref>\n\n===''The Western Canon''===\n''[[The Western Canon]]'' (1994), a survey of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focuses on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations<ref>Bloom (1994), p. 2.</ref> and of the [[Western canon]].<ref>Bloom (1994), p. 11.</ref> Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, Bloom's major concern in the volume was reclaiming literature from those he referred to as the \"[[School of Resentment]]\", the mostly academic critics who espoused a social purpose in reading. Bloom asserted that the goals of reading must be solitary [[aesthetic]] pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal of improving one's society held by \"forces of resentment\". He cast the latter as an absurd aim, writing: \"The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading [[Shakespeare]] is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools.\" His position was that politics had no place in literary criticism, that a [[feminist]] or [[Marxist]] reading of ''[[Hamlet]]'' would tell us something about feminism and Marxism but probably nothing about ''Hamlet'' itself.\n\nIn addition to considering how much influence a writer had had on later writers, Bloom proposed the concept of \"canonical strangeness\" (cf. [[uncanny]]) as a benchmark of a literary work's merit. ''The Western Canon'' also included a list\u2014which aroused more widespread interest than anything else in the volume\u2014of all the Western works from antiquity to the present that Bloom considered either permanent members of the canon of literary classics, or (among more recent works) candidates for that status. Bloom said that he made the list off the top of his head at his editor's request, and that he did not stand by it.<ref name=vice />\n\n===Work on Shakespeare===\n[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]] (1564\u20131616)]]\n\nBloom had a deep appreciation for [[William Shakespeare]]<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;2\u20133.</ref> and considered him to be the supreme center of the Western canon.<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;24\u20135.</ref> The first edition of ''The Anxiety of Influence'' almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom then considered barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, added a long preface that mostly expounded Shakespeare's debt to [[Ovid]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], and his [[agon#Literature|agon]] with contemporary [[Christopher Marlowe]], who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.\n\nIn his later survey, ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (1998), Bloom provided an analysis of each of Shakespeare's 38 plays, \"twenty-four of which are masterpieces.\" Written as a companion to the general reader and theater-goer, Bloom declared that [[bardolatry]] \"ought to be even more a secular religion than it already is.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''. New York: Riverhead, 1998, p. xix.</ref> He also contended in the work (as in the title) that Shakespeare \"invented\" humanity, in that he prescribed the now-common practice of \"overhearing\" ourselves, which drives our changes. The two paragons of his theory were [[Sir John Falstaff]] of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], whom Bloom saw as representing self-satisfaction and self-loathing, respectively. Throughout ''Shakespeare'', characters from disparate plays were imagined alongside and interacting with each other. This has been decried by numerous contemporary academics and critics as harking back to the out of fashion character criticism of [[A. C. Bradley]] (and others), who gathered explicit praise in the book. As in ''The Western Canon'', Bloom criticized what he called the \"School of Resentment\" for its failure to live up to the challenge of Shakespeare's universality and for [[Balkanization|balkanizing]] the study of literature through multicultural and [[New Historicism|historicist]] departments. Asserting Shakespeare's singular popularity throughout the world, Bloom proclaimed him the only truly multicultural author. Repudiating the \"social energies\" to which historicists ascribed Shakespeare's authorship, Bloom pronounced his modern academic foes \u2013 and indeed, all of society \u2013 to be but \"a parody of Shakespearian energies.\"\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nBloom consolidated his work on the western canon with the publication of ''How to Read and Why'' (2000) and ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' (2003). ''Hamlet: Poem Unlimited'' (also 2003) is an amendment to ''Shakespeare: Invention of the Human'' written after he decided the chapter on ''Hamlet'' in that earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself. Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in ''Where Shall Wisdom Be Found'' (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2005). Throughout the decade he also compiled, edited and introduced several major anthologies of poetry.\n\nBloom took part in the documentary, the ''[[Apparition of the Eternal Church]]'' (2006), made by [[Paul Festa]]. This documentary centered on many individuals' reactions to hearing, for the first time, Olivier Messiaen's organ piece ''[[Apparition de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9ternelle]]''.\n\nBloom began a book under the working title of ''Living Labyrinth'', centering on Shakespeare and [[Walt Whitman]], which was published as ''The Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life'' (2011).\n\nIn July 2011, after the publication of ''The Anatomy of Influence'' and after finishing work on ''The Shadow of a Great Rock'', Bloom was working on three further projects:\n* ''Achievement in the Evening Land from Emerson to [[Faulkner]]'', a history of American literature following the canonical model, which ultimately developed into his book ''The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime'' (2015).\n* ''The Hum of Thoughts Evaded in the Mind: A Literary Memoir'', which ultimately developed into his book ''Possessed by Memory: The Inward Light of Criticism'' (2019).\n* a play with the working title ''Walt Whitman: A Musical Pageant''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioopensource.org/harold-bloom-on-the-playing-field-of-poetry/|title=Harold Bloom: On the Playing Field of Poetry - Open Source with Christopher Lydon|author=|date=July 5, 2011|website=www.radioopensource.org|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref> By November 2011, Bloom had changed the title of the play to ''To You Whoever You Are: A Pageant Celebrating Walt Whitman''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/will-this-election-be-the-mormon-breakthrough.html \"Will This Election Be the Mormon Breakthrough?\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|In ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'', Bloom claimed that [[Samuel Johnson]] was \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him.\"]]\n\nIn 1986, Bloom credited [[Northrop Frye]] as his nearest precursor. He told [[Imre Salusinszky]] in 1986: \"In terms of my own theorizations&nbsp;... the precursor proper has to be Northrop Frye. I purchased and read ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'' a week or two after it had come out and reached the bookstore in Ithaca, New York. It ravished my heart away. I have tried to find an alternative father in Mr. [[Kenneth Burke]], who is a charming fellow and a very powerful critic, but I don't come from Burke, I come out of Frye.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html#roots|title=Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Interviews|author=|date=|website=prelectur.stanford.edu|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in ''Anatomy of Influence'' (2011), he wrote \"I no longer have the patience to read anything by Frye\" and nominated Angus Fletcher of the City University of New York among his living contemporaries as his \"critical guide and conscience\" and elsewhere that year recommended Fletcher's ''Colors of the Mind'' and ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' by [[M. H. Abrams]]. In this late phase of his career, Bloom also emphasized the tradition of earlier critics such as [[William Hazlitt]], Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Walter Pater]], [[A. C. Bradley]], and [[Samuel Johnson]], describing Johnson in ''The Western Canon'' as \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him\". In his 2012 Foreword to the book ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012), Bloom indicated the influence which M. H. Abrams had upon him in his years at Cornell University.<ref>M. H. Abrams. ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012).</ref>\n\nBloom's theory of poetic influence regards the development of [[Western literature]] as a process of borrowing and misreading. Writers find their creative inspiration in previous writers and begin by imitating those writers in order to develop a poetic voice of their own; however, they must make their own work different from that of their precursors. As a result, Bloom argues, authors of real power must inevitably \"misread\" their precursors' works in order to make room for fresh imaginings.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2225/the-art-of-criticism-no-1-harold-bloom| title=Harold Bloom, The Art of Criticism No. 1| journal=Paris Review| volume=Spring 1991| issue=118| date=Spring 1991| author=Antonio Weiss}}</ref><ref>Paul Fry, [http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-14 \"Engl 300: Introduction To Theory Of Literature\"].

He told [[Robert Moynihan]] in 1983, \"What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through [[apophatic theology|negative theology]]&nbsp;...

After Murdoch died, Bloom expressed admiration for novelists such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], [[Will Self]], [[John Banville]], and [[A. S. Byatt]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Genius : a mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds|year=2002|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-69129-1|page=648|quote=There are a few affinities, except perhaps with the admirable Antonia Byatt, in the generation after: novelists I also now admire, like Will Self, Peter Ackroyd, and John Banville.}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' (2003), he named the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer and Nobel Prize winner [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]] as \"the most gifted novelist alive in the world today\", and as \"one of the last titans of an expiring literary genre\".\n\nOf American novelists, he declared in 2003 that \"there are four living American novelists I know of who are still at work and who deserve our praise\".<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ \"Dumbing Down American Readers\"], ''Boston Globe'', September 24, 2003. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617015302/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ |date=June 17, 2006 }}</ref> He claimed that \"they write the Style of our Age, each has composed canonical works,\" and he identified them as [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Don DeLillo]].
