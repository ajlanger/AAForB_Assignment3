He was a disciple of the [[Dvaita]] philosopher-saint [[Vyasatirtha]], and a contemporary of yet another [[Haridasa]], [[Kanakadasa]]. His guru, Vyasatirtha, glorified Purandara Dasa in a song thus: ''D\u0101sarendare purandara d\u0101sarayya''. He was a composer, singer and one of the chief founding-proponents of South Indian classical music ([[Karnatiac music]]).

Thus the pure and transcendental [[Madhwa]] philosophy of harisarvottamattva (means the supreme one is Lord Hari or Vishnu and all others jivas or living beings are his servants) not only remained among the scholars but also reached even common man for his spiritual upliftment.

His practice was emulated by his younger contemporary, [[Kanakadasa]]. Purandara Dasa's Carnatic music compositions are mostly in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], though some are in [[Sanskrit]]. He signed his compositions with the ''ankita'' (pen name) \"Purandara Vittala\" ([[Vittala]] is another name of the supreme one, Lord [[Krishna]], one of the incarnations of the Lord [[Vishnu]]) and this same form of Lord [[Krishna]] is his aaradhya daiva or ishta murthi or worshippable deity.

He received a good education in accordance with the family traditions and acquired proficiency in Kannada, Sanskrit, and sacred music.  At the age of 16 he was married to one Saraswati Bai, held by tradition to have been a pious young girl. He lost his parents at age 20, thereby inheriting his father's business of gemstones and pawning. He prospered and became known as ''Navakoti Narayana''(an abundantly rich man; worth ninety millions).\n\nPopular legend narrates a miraculous incident in Srinivasa Nayaka's life, owing to which he was led to devote himself to the practice, propagation and inculcation of ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) towards Lord Krishna through musical compositions. As a natural, inescapable consequence of such a transforming event, ubiquitous in the lives of several saints throughout the ages, he is believed to have relinquished his former greedy and miserly self, having realized the worthlessness of attachment to worldly possessions:<ref>Iyengar, Masti Venkatesha (\"Srinavasa\"). 1964. [http://ellakavi.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/masti-venkatesha-iyengara-story ''Purandara Daasa'']. Bangalore: Bangalore Press.</ref> The Lord, in a bid to cure Srinivasa of his tenacious materialistic delusion and attachment, and thereby claim his devotion to Himself, approached Srinivasa in the guise of a poor man, with a piteous plea for money; ostensibly, the money was direly needed to perform His (!) son's ''upanayana'' (sacred initiation). \n\nHaving been summarily rejected, mocked and turned out, the 'poor man' surreptitiously repeated his plea before Srinivasa's wife; a generous soul of rigorous spiritual nature, she gave away one of her precious nose rings, unbeknownst to her husband; the 'poor man' sold the nose ring back to none other than Srinivasa himself! The shrewd Srinavasa, privy to his wife's openhandedness, immediately identified the nose ring as his wife's and hurried home; enraged and anxious to ascertain the truth of the matter, he demanded his wife to produce the nose ring before him immediately. \n\nRealizing that Srinivasa had grown wise to her secret donation, the wife decided to end her life with poison. Having completed her prayers to the Lord before her attempt, she was shocked to see a nose ring inside the poison cup \u2013 completely identical to the one she had just given away. Incredulous and rapturous, she recounted the entire episode to her husband, who was bewildered and lost. Meanwhile, a search for the 'poor man' was of no avail; he had as mysteriously vanished as he had appeared! At that very propitious moment, Srinivasa's old self \u2013 convinced of the inscrutable ways of the Lord, having witnessed the unfailing grace that saved his pious wife, bewildered at the power that could, in a moment, produce a gold ornament by mere will \u2013 instantly shook off that beginningless, persistent veil in the form of 'I' and 'mine', which masks the men's vision of the divine. At 30 years of age, he gave away all his wealth in charity, and together with his family, abandoned his house to lead the life of a mendicant \u2013 living on alms and singing the glories of the Lord. In his very first song composition, he laments his wasted life of indulgence. It begins with the words \"Ana lae kara\" in the [[Shuddha Saveri]] [[raga]], set to Triputa [[Tala (music)|tala]].\n\nIn the course of his wandering he met the holy sage [[Vyasatirtha]], one of the chief exponents of Madhwa philosophy and the ''rajaguru'' of Krishnadevaraya, the emperor of Vijayanagara kingdom. According to Prof. Sambamoorthy,<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/10/20/stories/2006102000060300.htm Friday Review Chennai and Tamil Nadu. Columns : An authority on Purandara Dasa]. ''The Hindu''. 20 October 2006. \n</ref> Srinivasa had his formal initiation at the hands of Vyasatirtha in 1525 when he was about 40 years old, with the name Purandara Dasa bestowed on him.  Purandara Dasa traveled extensively through the length and breadth of the [[Vijayanagara]] empire in Karnataka, Tirupati, Pandharapura composing and rendering soul stirring songs in praise of god. He spent his last years in Hampi and also sang in Krishnadevaraya's durbar. The mantapa (mandap) in which he stayed is known as Purandara Dasa Mantapa (mandap) in Hampi. He died on 2 January 1565 at the age of 80. Within a short period after his death, [[Vijayanagara]] empire collapsed. Tradition and legend holds that he composed {{formatnum:475000}} keerthanas (songs). Further, according to this legend, his original desire was to compose 500,000 keerthanas. Being unable to do it in his present life, he requested his younger son to complete them. His son Madhwapathi told his father that he could do this in his next janma (birth). It is believed that he was reborn as the famous [[Vijaya Dasa|Vijayadaasa]]\u2014birthplace is Cheekalparvi village near Maanvi town, Raichur district in Karnataka State\u2014and completed the remaining 25 thousand keerthanas as promised. Most his songs are in praise of Lord Narayana and other Devatas.  Due to this, he is believed to be an avatar of Narada, the celestial singer and son of Goddess Saraswati. One of the ''trimurtis'' (three icons) of Carnatic music, Saint [[Thyagaraja]], has paid tribute to Purandara Dasa in his ''geya natakam''(an opera) Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam.<ref>[http://thyagaraja-vaibhavam.blogspot.in/2011/07/prahlada-bhakti-vijayam-part-1-dance.html Thyagaraja Vaibhavam: Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Dance-Drama].

The philosophy of Bhakti in Purandara Dasa's compositions stems from the essential teachings of the realistic-pluralistic Madhwa Philosophy of [[Vaishnavism]], and has been rendered in simple Kannada. The individual soul (''jeeva'') is a ''pratibimba'' (reflection) of the Lord (''Vishnu/Ishvara''), who is the ''bimba'' (source). The ''jeeva'' owes its existence, knowledge and bliss to the ''Ishvara'', and any sense of independence with regards to one's actions and the results thereof is to be given up.<ref>[http://madhwabrahmanas.blogspot.in/2010/09/essence-of-madhva-philosophy.html Tattvavaada Philosophy: The Essence of Madhva Philosophy].

This is evident by the subsequent expressions in the song which says that one who does not practice self-discipline is untouchable, one who plots against his own government is untouchable, similarly one who shirks charity while having wealth is untouchable, one who poisons to eliminate his opponents is untouchable, one who does not use soft language is untouchable, one who prides over his purity of caste is untouchable and finally one who does not meditate on Purandara Vittala is untouchable.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Dasa's message is loud and clear rejecting untouchability in our society.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> He uses the name of Purandara Vittala to imply any God.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> This is evident from his other songs on various Gods and Goddesses.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Similar ideas were expressed by many other poets also.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/>\n\n== Example poem: Good \u2013 he became an ascetic-Hari Dasa ==\nPurandaradasa says how his wife made him Hari devotee and renounce all his crores of wealth and became an ascetic.\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|kn|'''\u0c86\u0ca6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2 \u0c92\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc6 \u0c86\u0caf\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc1'''\n\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97 : Poorvikalyani ; \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3 : \u0c86\u0ca6\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3}}\n\n{{lang|kn-Latn|Aadaddella oLitE aayitu namma\nShreedhara seve maadalu sadhana sampattayitu;\nDandige betta hidiyodakke\nmande maachi naachutalidde,\nHendati santati saavirvaagali\nDandige betta hidisidaLyya\nGopaaLa butti hidiyodakke.\nBhupatiyante garvisutidde,\nAa patnee kula saavirvaagali,\nGopaaLa butti hidisidaLayya;\nTuLasi male haakuvudakke\nArasanante naachutalidde,\nSarasijaksha Purandhara ViTTala\nTuLasi male haakisidnayya!}}\n|attr1=from Dasara Padagalu collection by G.

He was a disciple of the [[Dvaita]] philosopher-saint [[Vyasatirtha]], and a contemporary of yet another [[Haridasa]], [[Kanakadasa]]. His guru, Vyasatirtha, glorified Purandara Dasa in a song thus: ''D\u0101sarendare purandara d\u0101sarayya''. He was a composer, singer and one of the chief founding-proponents of South Indian classical music ([[Carnatic music]]).

Thus the pure and transcendental [[Madhwa]] philosophy of harisarvottamattva (means the supreme one is Lord Hari or Vishnu and all others jivas or living beings are his servants) not only remained among the scholars but also reached even common man for his spiritual upliftment.

His practice was emulated by his younger contemporary, [[Kanakadasa]]. Purandara Dasa's Carnatic music compositions are mostly in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], though some are in [[Sanskrit]]. He signed his compositions with the ''ankita'' (pen name) \"Purandara Vittala\" ([[Vittala]] is another name of the supreme one, Lord [[Krishna]], one of the incarnations of the Lord [[Vishnu]]) and this same form of Lord [[Krishna]] is his aaradhya daiva or ishta murthi or worshippable deity.

He received a good education in accordance with the family traditions and acquired proficiency in Kannada, Sanskrit, and sacred music.  At the age of 16 he was married to one Saraswati Bai, held by tradition to have been a pious young girl. He lost his parents at age 20, thereby inheriting his father's business of gemstones and pawning. He prospered and became known as ''Navakoti Narayana''(an abundantly rich man; worth ninety millions).\n\nPopular legend narrates a miraculous incident in Srinivasa Nayaka's life, owing to which he was led to devote himself to the practice, propagation and inculcation of ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) towards Lord Krishna through musical compositions. As a natural, inescapable consequence of such a transforming event, ubiquitous in the lives of several saints throughout the ages, he is believed to have relinquished his former greedy and miserly self, having realized the worthlessness of attachment to worldly possessions:<ref>Iyengar, Masti Venkatesha (\"Srinavasa\"). 1964. [http://ellakavi.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/masti-venkatesha-iyengara-story ''Purandara Daasa'']. Bangalore: Bangalore Press.</ref> The Lord, in a bid to cure Srinivasa of his tenacious materialistic delusion and attachment, and thereby claim his devotion to Himself, approached Srinivasa in the guise of a poor man, with a piteous plea for money; ostensibly, the money was direly needed to perform His (!) son's ''upanayana'' (sacred initiation). \n\nHaving been summarily rejected, mocked and turned out, the 'poor man' surreptitiously repeated his plea before Srinivasa's wife; a generous soul of rigorous spiritual nature, she gave away one of her precious nose rings, unbeknownst to her husband; the 'poor man' sold the nose ring back to none other than Srinivasa himself! The shrewd Srinavasa, privy to his wife's openhandedness, immediately identified the nose ring as his wife's and hurried home; enraged and anxious to ascertain the truth of the matter, he demanded his wife to produce the nose ring before him immediately. \n\nRealizing that Srinivasa had grown wise to her secret donation, the wife decided to end her life with poison. Having completed her prayers to the Lord before her attempt, she was shocked to see a nose ring inside the poison cup \u2013 completely identical to the one she had just given away. Incredulous and rapturous, she recounted the entire episode to her husband, who was bewildered and lost. Meanwhile, a search for the 'poor man' was of no avail; he had as mysteriously vanished as he had appeared! At that very propitious moment, Srinivasa's old self \u2013 convinced of the inscrutable ways of the Lord, having witnessed the unfailing grace that saved his pious wife, bewildered at the power that could, in a moment, produce a gold ornament by mere will \u2013 instantly shook off that beginningless, persistent veil in the form of 'I' and 'mine', which masks the men's vision of the divine. At 30 years of age, he gave away all his wealth in charity, and together with his family, abandoned his house to lead the life of a mendicant \u2013 living on alms and singing the glories of the Lord. In his very first song composition, he laments his wasted life of indulgence. It begins with the words \"Ana lae kara\" in the [[Shuddha Saveri]] [[raga]], set to Triputa [[Tala (music)|tala]].\n\nIn the course of his wandering he met the holy sage [[Vyasatirtha]], one of the chief exponents of Madhwa philosophy and the ''rajaguru'' of Krishnadevaraya, the emperor of Vijayanagara kingdom. According to Prof. Sambamoorthy,<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/10/20/stories/2006102000060300.htm Friday Review Chennai and Tamil Nadu. Columns : An authority on Purandara Dasa]. ''The Hindu''. 20 October 2006. \n</ref> Srinivasa had his formal initiation at the hands of Vyasatirtha in 1525 when he was about 40 years old, with the name Purandara Dasa bestowed on him.  Purandara Dasa traveled extensively through the length and breadth of the [[Vijayanagara]] empire in Karnataka, Tirupati, Pandharapura composing and rendering soul stirring songs in praise of god. He spent his last years in Hampi and also sang in Krishnadevaraya's durbar. The mantapa (mandap) in which he stayed is known as Purandara Dasa Mantapa (mandap) in Hampi. He died on 2 January 1565 at the age of 80. Within a short period after his death, [[Vijayanagara]] empire collapsed. Tradition and legend holds that he composed {{formatnum:475000}} keerthanas (songs). Further, according to this legend, his original desire was to compose 500,000 keerthanas. Being unable to do it in his present life, he requested his younger son to complete them. His son Madhwapathi told his father that he could do this in his next janma (birth). It is believed that he was reborn as the famous [[Vijaya Dasa|Vijayadaasa]]\u2014birthplace is Cheekalparvi village near Maanvi town, Raichur district in Karnataka State\u2014and completed the remaining 25 thousand keerthanas as promised. Most his songs are in praise of Lord Narayana and other Devatas.  Due to this, he is believed to be an avatar of Narada, the celestial singer and son of Goddess Saraswati. One of the ''trimurtis'' (three icons) of Carnatic music, Saint [[Thyagaraja]], has paid tribute to Purandara Dasa in his ''geya natakam''(an opera) Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam.<ref>[http://thyagaraja-vaibhavam.blogspot.in/2011/07/prahlada-bhakti-vijayam-part-1-dance.html Thyagaraja Vaibhavam: Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Dance-Drama].

He introduced the [[raga]] ''[[Mayamalavagowla]]'' as the basic scale for music instruction and fashioned a series of graded lessons such as ''swaravalis'', ''janti swaras'', ''alankaras'', ''lakshana geetas'', ''prabandhas'', ''ugabhogas'', ''daatu varase'', ''geeta'', ''sooladis'' and ''[[kriti]]s''.<ref name=\"iyer\"/> Another of his important contributions{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} was the fusion of ''bhava'', ''raga'', and ''laya'' in his compositions. He included comments on ordinary daily life and elements of colloquial language in his lyrics.

Singer Madras Lalithangi, and her illustrious daughter Padmavibushan, Sangeetha Kalanidhi [[M. L. Vasanthakumari]] have rendered yeoman service in propagating the compositions of Purandara Dasa; both were considered as authorities on Purandara Dasa. M. L. Vasantha Kumari was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Mysore University]] for her contributions to Purandara Dasa's music.\n\nThough the compositions of Purandara Dasa are originally in the ''ragas'' of the Carnatic system of music, his compositions have been adopted and made equally popular in [[Hindustani music]]. Hindustani music legends such as [[Bhimsen Joshi]], [[Madhav Gudi]] and [[Basavaraj Rajguru]] have made them more popular in recent years.\n\nClassical vocalists and musicians such as [[Upendra Bhat]], [[Puttur Narasimha Nayak]], [[Venkatesh Kumar]], [[Nagaraja Rao Havaldar]], [[Ganapathi Bhatt]], [[Vidyabhushana]], [[Pravin Godkhindi]], [[Nachiketa Sharma]], [[Sangeetha Katti]], and the [[Bombay Sisters]] are continuing the tradition of singing and performing Purandara Dasa's compositions and other Dasa Sahitya songs in Carnatic as well as Hindustani music concerts. Of late, Mysore Ramachandracharya is industriously propagating dasa sahitya through his concerts. [[Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams]] is also propagating the dasa krithis through the Dasa Sahitya Project. He also composed the first [[lullaby]] songs in Carnatic music, such as ''Thoogire Rangana''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5S8DbE6pWI Toogire Rangana]. YouTube (29 September 2012).

It teaches complete self-surrender and unadulterated love towards Lord Krishna, the Supreme. The philosophy of Bhakti in Purandara Dasa's compositions stems from the essential teachings of the realistic-pluralistic Madhwa Philosophy of [[Vaishnavism]], and has been rendered in simple Kannada. The individual soul (''jeeva'') is a ''pratibimba'' (reflection) of the Lord (''Vishnu/Ishvara''), who is the ''bimba'' (source). The ''jeeva'' owes its existence, knowledge and bliss to the ''Ishvara'', and any sense of independence with regards to one's actions and the results thereof is to be given up.<ref>[http://madhwabrahmanas.blogspot.in/2010/09/essence-of-madhva-philosophy.html Tattvavaada Philosophy: The Essence of Madhva Philosophy].

His ''[[keerthana]]s'' have simple lessons in this regard and implore men to lead the noble life of a ''Vaishnava''.<ref>[http://bellurramki18.wordpress.com/2007/01/19/sri-purandara-dasa-1494-1564/ Sri Purandara Dasa (1494\u20131564) | Rambling with Bellur].

The usage of the word untouchable is not used in the limited context of physical contact with the person, it is the worthlessness of the association with that person which is highlighted here. This is evident by the subsequent expressions in the song which says that one who does not practice self-discipline is untouchable, one who plots against his own government is untouchable, similarly one who shirks charity while having wealth is untouchable, one who poisons to eliminate his opponents is untouchable, one who does not use soft language is untouchable, one who prides over his purity of caste is untouchable and finally one who does not meditate on Purandara Vittala is untouchable.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Dasa's message is loud and clear rejecting untouchability in our society.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> He uses the name of Purandara Vittala to imply any God.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> This is evident from his other songs on various Gods and Goddesses.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Similar ideas were expressed by many other poets also.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/>\n\n== Example poem: Good \u2013 he became an ascetic-Hari Dasa ==\nPurandaradasa says how his wife made him Hari devotee and renounce all his crores of wealth and became an ascetic.\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|kn|'''\u0c86\u0ca6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2 \u0c92\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc6 \u0c86\u0caf\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc1'''\n\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97 : Poorvikalyani ; \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3 : \u0c86\u0ca6\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3}}\n\n{{lang|kn-Latn|Aadaddella oLitE aayitu namma\nShreedhara seve maadalu sadhana sampattayitu;\nDandige betta hidiyodakke\nmande maachi naachutalidde,\nHendati santati saavirvaagali\nDandige betta hidisidaLyya\nGopaaLa butti hidiyodakke.\nBhupatiyante garvisutidde,\nAa patnee kula saavirvaagali,\nGopaaLa butti hidisidaLayya;\nTuLasi male haakuvudakke\nArasanante naachutalidde,\nSarasijaksha Purandhara ViTTala\nTuLasi male haakisidnayya!}}\n|attr1=from Dasara Padagalu collection by G.
