{"title_page": "Data erasure", "text_new": "'''Data erasure''' (sometimes referred to as '''data clearing''', '''data wiping''', or '''data destruction''') is a software-based method of [[overwriting]] the data that aims to completely destroy all [[Data remanence|electronic data residing]] on a [[hard disk drive]] or other [[digital media]] by using zeros and ones to overwrite data onto all sectors of the device. By overwriting the data on the storage device, the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization.\n\nIdeally, software designed for data erasure should:\n \n#Allow for selection of a specific standard, based on unique needs, and \n#Verify the overwriting method has been successful and removed data across the entire device.\n\nPermanent data erasure goes beyond basic [[file deletion]] commands, which only remove direct pointers to the data [[disk sector]]s and make the [[data recovery]] possible with common software tools. Unlike [[degaussing]] and physical destruction, which render the storage media unusable, data erasure removes all information while leaving the disk operable. New [[flash memory]]-based media implementations, such as [[solid-state drive]]s or [[USB flash drive]]s, can cause data erasure techniques to fail allowing [[remnant data]] to be recoverable.<ref name=\"m.wei\">{{cite web |title=Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf |work=FAST '11: 9th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies |accessdate=31 October 2013 |author1=Michael Wei |author2=Laura M.

There are key differentiators between data erasure and other overwriting methods, which can leave data intact and raise the risk of [[data breach]], [[identity theft]] or failure to achieve regulatory compliance. Many data eradication programs also provide [[#Number of overwrites needed|multiple overwrites]] so that they support recognized government and industry standards, though a single-pass overwrite is widely considered to be sufficient for modern hard disk drives. Good software should provide verification of data removal, which is necessary for meeting certain standards.\n\nTo protect the data on lost or stolen media, some data erasure applications remotely destroy the data if the password is incorrectly entered. Data erasure tools can also target specific data on a disk for routine erasure, providing a [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] protection method that is less time-consuming than software encryption. [[Electronic hardware|Hardware]]/[[firmware]] encryption built into the drive itself or integrated controllers is a popular solution with no degradation in performance at all.\n\n==Encryption==\nWhen encryption is in place, data erasure acts as a complement to [[crypto-shredding]], or the practice of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys. \nPresently, dedicated hardware/firmware encryption solutions can perform a 256-bit full [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES encryption]] faster than the drive electronics can write the data. Drives with this capability are known as self-encrypting drives ([[Hardware-based full disk encryption|SEDs]]); they are present on most modern enterprise-level laptops and are increasingly used in the enterprise to protect the data. Changing the encryption key renders inaccessible all data stored on a SED, which is an easy and very fast method for achieving a 100% data erasure. Theft of an SED results in a physical asset loss, but the stored data is inaccessible without the decryption key that is not stored on a SED, assuming there are no effective attacks against AES or its implementation in the drive hardware.\n\n==Importance==\nInformation technology assets commonly hold large volumes of confidential data. [[Social security number]]s, credit card numbers, bank details, medical history and classified information are often stored on computer hard drives or [[Server (computing)|servers]]. These can inadvertently or intentionally make their way onto other media such as printers, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[Flash memory|flash]], [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz]], and [[Iomega REV|REV]] drives.\n\n===Data breach===\nIncreased storage of sensitive data, combined with rapid technological change and the shorter lifespan of IT assets, has driven the need for permanent data erasure of electronic devices as they are retired or refurbished. Also, compromised networks and [[laptop theft]] and loss, as well as that of other portable media, are increasingly common sources of data breaches.\n\nIf data erasure does not occur when a disk is retired or lost, an organization or user faces a possibility that the data will be stolen and compromised, leading to identity theft, loss of corporate reputation, threats to regulatory compliance and financial impacts. Companies spend large amounts of money to make sure their data is erased when they discard disks.<ref name=breach>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|title=Average data breach costs companies $5 million|author=Fontana, John|work=[[Network World]]|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2010-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808113930/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|archive-date=8 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{dubious|The reference talks links to http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/102506-data-breach-costs-rise-year.html as a source, but that doesn't support the claim at all|date=January 2012}} High-profile incidents of data theft include:<!-- date order -->\n* CardSystems Solutions (2005-06-19): Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts.<ref>{{cite news|author=Evers, Joris |date=2005-06-19|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/credit-card-breach-exposes-40-million-accounts-139197997.htm |title=Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts |agency=[[CNET News]]|publisher=[[ZDNET]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref><!-- was dead link, correct title made recovery easy-->\n* Lifeblood (2008-02-13):  Missing laptops contain personal information including dates of birth and some Social Security numbers of 321,000.<ref>{{cite web| author=Powers, Mary |date=2008-02-13|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/13/missing-lifeblood-laptops-personal-information-tho/ |title=Laptops missing with IDs of donors|work=[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Hannaford (2008-03-17): Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.<ref>{{cite news| author=Sharp, David |date=2008-03-17|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23678909 |title=Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.|agency= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=NBC News|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Compass Bank (2008-03-21): Stolen hard drive contains 1,000,000 customer records.<ref>Vijayan, Jaikumar (2008-03-21).

[[Bad sector]]s cannot usually be overwritten, but may contain recoverable information. Bad sectors, however, may be [[S.M.A.R.T.#Visibility to host systems|invisible]] to the host system and thus to the erasing software. [[Disk encryption software|Disk encryption]] before use prevents this problem. Software-driven data erasure could also be compromised by malicious code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/government/MDG/NSA_CSS_Storage_Device_Declassification_Manual.pdf|format=PDF|title=NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual|publisher=[[NSA]]|access-date=19 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320074045/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/government/MDG/NSA_CSS_Storage_Device_Declassification_Manual.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}} This Manual 912 supersedes NSA/CSS Manual 1302, dated 10 November 2000.</ref>\n\n==Differentiators==\nSoftware-based data erasure uses a disk accessible application to write a combination of ones, zeroes and any other [[Alphanumeric character generator|alpha numeric character]] also known as the \"mask\" onto each hard disk drive sector. The level of [[security]] when using software data destruction tools are increased dramatically by pre-testing hard drives for sector abnormalities and ensuring that the drive is 100% in working order. The number of wipes has become obsolete with the more recent inclusion of a \"verify pass\" which scans all sectors of the disk and checks against what character should be there i.e.; 1 Pass of AA has to fill every writable sector of the hard disk. This makes any more than 1 Pass an unnecessary and certainly a more damaging act especially as drives have passed the 1TB mark.\n\n===Full disk overwriting===\nWhile there are many overwriting programs, only those capable of complete data erasure offer full security by destroying the data on all areas of a hard drive. Disk overwriting programs that cannot access the entire hard drive, including hidden/locked areas like the [[host protected area]] (HPA), [[device configuration overlay]] (DCO), and remapped sectors, perform an incomplete erasure, leaving some of the data intact. By accessing the entire hard drive, data erasure eliminates the risk of [[data remanence]].\n\nData erasure can also bypass the [[operating system|Operating System (OS)]]. Overwriting programs that operate through the OS will not always perform a complete erasure because they cannot modify the contents of the hard drive that are actively in use by that OS. Because of this, many data erasure programs like [[Darik's Boot and Nuke|DBAN]] are provided in a bootable format, where you run off of a [[live CD]] that has all of the necessary software to erase the disk.\n\n===Hardware support===\nData erasure can be deployed over a network to target multiple [[Personal computer|PCs]] rather than having to erase each one sequentially. In contrast with [[DOS]]-based overwriting programs that may not detect all network hardware, [[Linux]]-based data erasure software supports high-end server and [[storage area network]] (SAN) environments with hardware support for [[Serial ATA]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS) and [[Fibre Channel]] disks and remapped sectors. It operates directly with sector sizes such as 520, 524, and 528, removing the need to first reformat back to 512 sector size. [[WinPE]] has now overtaken Linux as the environment of choice since drivers can be added with little effort. This also helps with data destruction of tablets and other handheld devices that require pure UEFI environments without hardware NIC's installed and/or are lacking UEFI network stack support.\n\n===Standards===\nMany government and industry standards exist for software-based overwriting that removes the data. A key factor in meeting these standards is the number of times the data is overwritten. Also, some standards require a method to verify that all the data have been removed from the entire hard drive and to view the overwrite pattern. Complete data erasure should account for hidden areas, typically DCO, HPA and remapped sectors.\n\nThe 1995 edition of the [[National Industrial Security Program]] Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) permitted the use of overwriting techniques to sanitize some types of media by writing all addressable locations with a character, its complement, and then a random character. This provision was removed in a 2001 change to the manual and was never permitted for Top Secret media, but it is still listed as a technique by many providers of the data erasure software.<ref name=\"22-M\"/>\n\nData erasure software should provide the user with a [[Verification and validation|validation]] certificate indicating that the overwriting procedure was completed properly. Data erasure software should{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also comply with requirements to erase hidden areas, provide a defects log list and list bad sectors that could not be overwritten.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By overwriting the data on the storage device, the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization.\n\nIdeally, software designed for data erasure should:\n \n#Allow for selection of a specific standard, based on unique needs, and \n#Verify the overwriting method has been successful and removed data across the entire device.\n\nPermanent data erasure goes beyond basic [[file deletion]] commands, which only remove direct pointers to the data [[disk sector]]s and make the [[data recovery]] possible with common software tools. Unlike [[degaussing]] and physical destruction, which render the storage media unusable, data erasure removes all information while leaving the disk operable. New [[flash memory]]-based media implementations, such as [[solid-state drive]]s or [[USB flash drive]]s, can cause data erasure techniques to fail allowing [[remnant data]] to be recoverable.<ref name=\"m.wei\">{{cite web |title=Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf |work=FAST '11: 9th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies |accessdate=31 October 2013 |author1=Michael Wei |author2=Laura M.

We found that none of the available software techniques for sanitizing individual files were effective.}}</ref>\n\nSoftware-based overwriting uses a software application to write a stream of zeros, ones or meaningless pseudorandom data onto all sectors of a hard disk drive. There are key differentiators between data erasure and other overwriting methods, which can leave data intact and raise the risk of [[data breach]], [[identity theft]] or failure to achieve regulatory compliance. Many data eradication programs also provide [[#Number of overwrites needed|multiple overwrites]] so that they support recognized government and industry standards, though a single-pass overwrite is widely considered to be sufficient for modern hard disk drives. Good software should provide verification of data removal, which is necessary for meeting certain standards.\n\nTo protect the data on lost or stolen media, some data erasure applications remotely destroy the data if the password is incorrectly entered. Data erasure tools can also target specific data on a disk for routine erasure, providing a [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] protection method that is less time-consuming than software encryption. [[Electronic hardware|Hardware]]/[[firmware]] encryption built into the drive itself or integrated controllers is a popular solution with no degradation in performance at all.\n\n==Encryption==\nWhen encryption is in place, data erasure acts as a complement to [[crypto-shredding]], or the practice of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys. \nPresently, dedicated hardware/firmware encryption solutions can perform a 256-bit full [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES encryption]] faster than the drive electronics can write the data. Drives with this capability are known as self-encrypting drives ([[Hardware-based full disk encryption|SEDs]]); they are present on most modern enterprise-level laptops and are increasingly used in the enterprise to protect the data. Changing the encryption key renders inaccessible all data stored on a SED, which is an easy and very fast method for achieving a 100% data erasure. Theft of an SED results in a physical asset loss, but the stored data is inaccessible without the decryption key that is not stored on a SED, assuming there are no effective attacks against AES or its implementation in the drive hardware.\n\n==Importance==\nInformation technology assets commonly hold large volumes of confidential data. [[Social security number]]s, credit card numbers, bank details, medical history and classified information are often stored on computer hard drives or [[Server (computing)|servers]]. These can inadvertently or intentionally make their way onto other media such as printers, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[Flash memory|flash]], [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz]], and [[Iomega REV|REV]] drives.\n\n===Data breach===\nIncreased storage of sensitive data, combined with rapid technological change and the shorter lifespan of IT assets, has driven the need for permanent data erasure of electronic devices as they are retired or refurbished. Also, compromised networks and [[laptop theft]] and loss, as well as that of other portable media, are increasingly common sources of data breaches.\n\nIf data erasure does not occur when a disk is retired or lost, an organization or user faces a possibility that the data will be stolen and compromised, leading to identity theft, loss of corporate reputation, threats to regulatory compliance and financial impacts. Companies spend large amounts of money to make sure their data is erased when they discard disks.<ref name=breach>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|title=Average data breach costs companies $5 million|author=Fontana, John|work=[[Network World]]|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2010-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808113930/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|archive-date=8 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{dubious|The reference talks links to http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/102506-data-breach-costs-rise-year.html as a source, but that doesn't support the claim at all|date=January 2012}} High-profile incidents of data theft include:<!-- date order -->\n* CardSystems Solutions (2005-06-19): Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts.<ref>{{cite news|author=Evers, Joris |date=2005-06-19|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/credit-card-breach-exposes-40-million-accounts-139197997.htm |title=Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts |agency=[[CNET News]]|publisher=[[ZDNET]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref><!-- was dead link, correct title made recovery easy-->\n* Lifeblood (2008-02-13):  Missing laptops contain personal information including dates of birth and some Social Security numbers of 321,000.<ref>{{cite web| author=Powers, Mary |date=2008-02-13|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/13/missing-lifeblood-laptops-personal-information-tho/ |title=Laptops missing with IDs of donors|work=[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Hannaford (2008-03-17): Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.<ref>{{cite news| author=Sharp, David |date=2008-03-17|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23678909 |title=Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.|agency= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=NBC News|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Compass Bank (2008-03-21): Stolen hard drive contains 1,000,000 customer records.<ref>Vijayan, Jaikumar (2008-03-21).

[[Disk encryption software|Disk encryption]] before use prevents this problem. Software-driven data erasure could also be compromised by malicious code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/government/MDG/NSA_CSS_Storage_Device_Declassification_Manual.pdf|format=PDF|title=NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual|publisher=[[NSA]]|access-date=19 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320074045/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/government/MDG/NSA_CSS_Storage_Device_Declassification_Manual.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}} This Manual 912 supersedes NSA/CSS Manual 1302, dated 10 November 2000.</ref>\n\n==Differentiators==\nSoftware-based data erasure uses a disk accessible application to write a combination of ones, zeroes and any other [[Alphanumeric character generator|alpha numeric character]] also known as the \"mask\" onto each hard disk drive sector. The level of [[security]] when using software data destruction tools are increased dramatically by pre-testing hard drives for sector abnormalities and ensuring that the drive is 100% in working order. The number of wipes has become obsolete with the more recent inclusion of a \"verify pass\" which scans all sectors of the disk and checks against what character should be there i.e.; 1 Pass of AA has to fill every writable sector of the hard disk. This makes any more than 1 Pass an unnecessary and certainly a more damaging act especially as drives have passed the 1TB mark.\n\n===Full disk overwriting===\nWhile there are many overwriting programs, only those capable of complete data erasure offer full security by destroying the data on all areas of a hard drive. Disk overwriting programs that cannot access the entire hard drive, including hidden/locked areas like the [[host protected area]] (HPA), [[device configuration overlay]] (DCO), and remapped sectors, perform an incomplete erasure, leaving some of the data intact. By accessing the entire hard drive, data erasure eliminates the risk of [[data remanence]].\n\nData erasure can also bypass the [[operating system|Operating System (OS)]]. Overwriting programs that operate through the OS will not always perform a complete erasure because they cannot modify the contents of the hard drive that are actively in use by that OS. Because of this, many data erasure programs like [[Darik's Boot and Nuke|DBAN]] are provided in a bootable format, where you run off of a [[live CD]] that has all of the necessary software to erase the disk.\n\n===Hardware support===\nData erasure can be deployed over a network to target multiple [[Personal computer|PCs]] rather than having to erase each one sequentially. In contrast with [[DOS]]-based overwriting programs that may not detect all network hardware, [[Linux]]-based data erasure software supports high-end server and [[storage area network]] (SAN) environments with hardware support for [[Serial ATA]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS) and [[Fibre Channel]] disks and remapped sectors. It operates directly with sector sizes such as 520, 524, and 528, removing the need to first reformat back to 512 sector size. [[WinPE]] has now overtaken Linux as the environment of choice since drivers can be added with little effort. This also helps with data destruction of tablets and other handheld devices that require pure UEFI environments without hardware NIC's installed and/or are lacking UEFI network stack support.\n\n===Standards===\nMany government and industry standards exist for software-based overwriting that removes the data. A key factor in meeting these standards is the number of times the data is overwritten. Also, some standards require a method to verify that all the data have been removed from the entire hard drive and to view the overwrite pattern. Complete data erasure should account for hidden areas, typically DCO, HPA and remapped sectors.\n\nThe 1995 edition of the [[National Industrial Security Program]] Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) permitted the use of overwriting techniques to sanitize some types of media by writing all addressable locations with a character, its complement, and then a random character. This provision was removed in a 2001 change to the manual and was never permitted for Top Secret media, but it is still listed as a technique by many providers of the data erasure software.<ref name=\"22-M\"/>\n\nData erasure software should provide the user with a [[Verification and validation|validation]] certificate indicating that the overwriting procedure was completed properly. Data erasure software should{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also comply with requirements to erase hidden areas, provide a defects log list and list bad sectors that could not be overwritten.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
