The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.<ref name=\"History\">[http://m.timesonline.com/columnists/jeffrey_snedden/the-hub-rochester-s-formative-days-were-once-part-of/article_0f3db55e-2971-11e5-ae2f-0fd2e71c2598.html?mode=jqm The Hub: Rochester\u2019s formative days were once part of East Bridgewater] ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' (07/14/2015)</ref>\n\nMany of the streets that run through Rochester today had different names based on wild animals.

Fry Glass Factory, c. 1910]]\nWhat would eventually become Rochester was originally a [[Lenape]] village called [[Sawcunk]] before being settled in 1799 in what was then the [[American frontier]] by white settlers. During this time, what would eventually become Rochester was known as East [[Bridgewater, Pennsylvania|Bridgewater]], Fairport, and Beaver Point. The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.<ref name=\"History\">[http://m.timesonline.com/columnists/jeffrey_snedden/the-hub-rochester-s-formative-days-were-once-part-of/article_0f3db55e-2971-11e5-ae2f-0fd2e71c2598.html?mode=jqm The Hub: Rochester\u2019s formative days were once part of East Bridgewater] ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' (07/14/2015)</ref>\n\nMany of the streets that run through Rochester today had different names based on wild animals. Virginia Avenue and Adams Street\u2014two of the city's main thoroughfares via [[Pennsylvania Route 68]]\u2014were once known as Fox Lane and Tiger Lane, respectively. Deer Lane, which still exists today, is the last remnant of the original naming scheme for the street grid in the borough.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nRochester is where [[Henry Clay Fry]] and his associates formed a glass manufacturing company following Fry's return from the [[American Civil War]].
