In the [[frame story]], four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|wartime evacuation]]. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic of a [[wardrobe]] in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.\n\nLewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, [[Lucy Barfield]]. She was the daughter of [[Owen Barfield]], Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser and trustee.<ref>Schakel 2002 p. 75</ref> In 2003, ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was ranked ninth on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml \"BBC&nbsp;\u2013 The Big Read\"].

Lucy meets [[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]] who befriends her and informs her that she is in the land of Narnia. He invites her to have tea with him at his cave. Eventually, he reveals that he is in the pay of the [[White Witch]], a ruler who has kept Narnia frozen in a perpetual winter and who has given out orders that any human found in Narnia was to be captured and handed over to her. Tumnus then repents and realises that he cannot hand Lucy over to the Witch. He guides Lucy back to the lamppost. Once there, she returns to her own world by re-entering the wardrobe and finds that only a few seconds have passed there during her absence. None of her siblings believe her story about Narnia; upon inspection, the back of the wardrobe appears solid and leads nowhere. \n\nLucy enters the wardrobe again, and it again leads her into Narnia. This time, Edmund follows Lucy and also enters Narnia, but is unable to find his sister. Upon arriving in Narnia, Edmund encounters a great lady on a reindeer-drawn sleigh. She introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia, and plies him with sweet [[Turkish Delight]]. She is keen to find out as much as possible about Edmund, and is particularly interested in the fact that he has a brother and two sisters. She promises to reward Edmund with more Turkish Delight if he brings his brother and sisters to her house, and also promises to make him a prince and eventually King of Narnia. She then departs and when Edmund reaches the lamp-post, Lucy catches up with him. During their conversation about Narnia, Lucy tells Edmund that she has been to visit Tumnus the faun, and that the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting her go on her first visit. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund realises that the Witch is no other than the lady he has just made friends with, but he remains quiet about his meeting with her. When they returned to their own world, however, Edmund decides to make out that Lucy has been telling lies about the country in the wardrobe, much to her dismay. Peter is angry with Edmund for his supposed encouragement and jeering towards Lucy over her \"imaginary\" country, and quickly agrees with Susan that they need to speak to the professor, as they fear that Lucy is going mad. The professor, however, suggests that Lucy's story may well be true - particularly as Peter and Susan always saw her as the more honest sibling, and it is perfect obvious in the professor's opinion that Lucy is not mad. \n\nSoon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together while hiding in the wardrobe from the housekeeper, Mrs. Macready, who was giving a tour of the house to some visitors. Lucy leads the group to Tumnus's cave, only to find that it has been ransacked and that the faun is under arrest on a charge of treason against the Queen of Narnia (the White Witch), as mentioned in a letter signed by [[Maugrim]], chief of the White Witch's secret police. The children are befriended by [[Mr. Beaver]], a talking animal who takes them to his home. He informs them that Tumnus was last seen heading northwards - in the direction of the White Witch's castle - after being arrested by the secret police. His exact fate is unknown, but few people who have been taken into the castle have ever come out again - the courtyard, stairway and hall are reportedly full of statues of Narnians she has turned to stone. He and his wife tell the children about a prophecy that the Witch's tyranny will end when \"two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve\" sit on the four thrones of [[Cair Paravel]], and that Narnia's true ruler \u2014 the great lion [[Aslan]] \u2014 is at last arriving in Narnia, and they will be meeting him tomorrow at the Stone Table.\n\nEdmund slips away to the Witch's castle. In the courtyard, he is surprised by the many statues of Narnians the Witch has turned to stone. He first encounters Maugrim, who allows him to enter the castle. The Witch is furious that Edmund has come alone, and is angrier still to learn that Aslan \u2014 her enemy \u2014 has arrived in Narnia. She prepares to head to the Stone Table with Edmund in tow and her dwarf driving the sledge. She also orders Maugrim to take with him the swiftest of his wolves and kill Edmund's siblings and the beavers, and to head to the Stone Table if the children and beavers are already gone.\n\nMeanwhile, the children and the beavers notice Edmund's absence, and Mr Beaver was quick to reach the conclusion that Edmund had gone to the White Witch. They prepare for a long journey with the other children to meet Aslan. They finally reach a hiding place after walking for several miles in order to get some sleep. They are greeted the next morning by Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the Witch's magic - this is the first major sign that the Witch's power is crumbling. By the time they have reached the Stone Table to meet Aslan, the snow has melted and winter has ended. \n\n[[Maugrim]] then approaches the camp and attempts to attack Susan, but is killed by Peter. Aslan sends a rescue party for Edmund; it arrives just in time to save him from the Witch, who had decided to kill him. The Witch parleys with Aslan, invoking the \"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\" which gives her the right to kill Edmund for his treason. Aslan then speaks to the Witch alone, and on his return he announces that the Witch has renounced her claim on Edmund's life. Aslan and his followers then move the encampment on into the nearby forest.\n\nThat evening, Susan and Lucy follow Aslan, who leads them to the Stone Table. They watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death - as they had agreed in their pact to spare Edmund. After the Witch and her followers depart to prepare for battle against Aslan's followers, Susan and Lucy remain with Aslan's body. In the morning, the girls find the Stone Table broken and Aslan restored to life. Aslan explains that the \"Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time\" has the power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor. Aslan takes the girls to the Witch's house and revives the Narnians that the Witch had turned to stone, including Tumnus and a giant named Rumblebuffin. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch's army. The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.\n\nAfter a long and happy reign, the adult Pevensies go on a hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The four arrive at the lamppost and, having forgotten about it, unintentionally return through the wardrobe when they were looking for new adventures. When they return to England, they are children again, with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to the professor, who believes them and reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it.\n\n==Main characters==\n*[[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary protagonist of the story. She is the first to discover the land of Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe while exploring the Professor's house. When Lucy tells her three siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n*[[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned King Edmund the Just.\n*[[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of Edmund's. Tending to Aslan's carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavor to bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan the Gentle.\n*[[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude. Peter also disbelieves Lucy's stories about Narnia until he sees it for himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of [[Maugrim]] and for his command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent.\n*[[Aslan]], a [[lion]], is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and her minions. As the \"son of the Emperor beyond the sea\" (an allusion to [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical portrait, of [[Jesus|Christ]].<ref>Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in {{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Walter|title=The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III|year=2007|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-081922-4|page=1245}}</ref>\n*[[White Witch|The White Witch]] is the land's self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the story. Her spell on Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with her wand. She fears the fulfillment of a prophecy that \"two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve\" (meaning two male humans and two female humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as \"the White Witch\", or just \"the Witch\". Her actual name, \"Jadis,\" appears once in the notice left on Tumnus's door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a [[The Magician's Nephew|prequel]] to include her back story and account for her presence in the Narnian world.\n*[[Digory Kirke|The Professor]] is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of the series).\n*[[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]], is the first individual Lucy (who calls him \"Mr. Tumnus\") meets in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch's standing order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the Witch's forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund. The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later restored to life by Aslan.\n*[[Mr. and Mrs. Beaver]], two [[beaver]]s, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan and Lucy and lead them to Aslan.\n\n==Writing==\nLewis described the origin of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in an essay titled \"It All Began with a Picture\":<ref>Lewis (1960). \"It All Began with a Picture\". ''Radio Times''. 15 July 1960. In Hooper (1982), p. 53.</ref>\n:The ''Lion'' all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.'\n\nShortly before the Second World War many children were evacuated from London to the English countryside to escape bomber attacks on London by Nazi Germany.

''C. S. Lewis: A Biography. Fully Revised and Expanded Edition''. p. 303. {{ISBN|0-00-715714-2}}.</ref>\n\nHow much more of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain. [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947 Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: \"I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.\"<ref>Lewis (2004 [1947]).

Baxter dated 10 September 1947.</ref>\n\nThe plot element of entering a new world through the back of a wardrobe had certainly entered Lewis's mind by 1946, when he used it to describe his first encounter with really good poetry:\n:I did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or better quality a pleasure I had already known. It was more as if a cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats proved one day, when you opened the door, to lead to the [[garden of the Hesperides]]&nbsp;...<ref>Lewis (1946), \"Different Tastes in Literature\". In Hooper (1982), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn August 1948, during a visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis talked vaguely about completing a children's book he had begun \"in the tradition of [[E. Nesbit]]\".<ref>Walsh, Chad (1974). ''C. S. Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics''. Norwood Editions. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-88305-779-4}}.</ref> After this conversation not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay \"It All Began With a Picture\" Lewis continues: \"At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\"<ref>Lewis (1960). In Hooper (1982), pp. xix, 53.</ref>\n\nThe major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written fourteen years earlier in his alliterative poem ''The Planets'':\n:...&nbsp;Of wrath ended\n:And woes mended, of winter passed\n:And guilt forgiven, and good fortune\n:[[Jupiter (mythology)|J<small>OVE</small>]] is master; and of jocund revel,\n:Laughter of ladies.

Lewis'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780195313871}}.</ref>\n\nOn 10 March 1949 [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] dined with Lewis at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.<ref>Hooper, Walter. \"Lucy Barfield (1935\u20132003)\".

Lewis chose [[Pauline Baynes]], possibly based on [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]]'s recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis's appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after ''[[The Last Battle]]'' won the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for best children's book of 1956: \"is it not rather 'our' medal? I'm sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text\".<ref>Schakel 2002, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.<ref>Schakel 2002, p. 132.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nLewis very much enjoyed writing ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and embarked on the sequel ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late in 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.<ref>Veith, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nWhile Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children's writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated\u2014attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.<ref>Veith, p. 12.</ref>\n\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis's reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.<ref>Veith, p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn the United States a 2004 study found that ''The Lion'' was a common read-aloud book for seventh-graders in schools in [[San Diego County, California]].<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Fisher, Douglas, James Flood, Diane Lapp, and Nancy Frey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207031123/http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-07 |year=2004 |title= Interactive Read-Alouds: Is There a Common Set of Implementation Practices? |journal=[[The Reading Teacher]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages= 8\u201317|url= http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |accessdate= 2012-08-22 |doi=10.1598/RT.58.1.1}}</ref> In 2005 it was included on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'''s unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.<ref name=Time2005/> Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. [[National Education Association]] named it one of \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\".<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> In 2012 it was ranked number five among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'', a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.<ref name=SLJChapter2012>{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |title= Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= A Fuse #8 Production.

Most reprintings of the novels until the 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 [[HarperCollins]] published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in the novels. This meant ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' was numbered as the first in the series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of the novels outside the United States, also acquired the rights to publish the novels in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.<ref>Schakel, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nLaurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels\u2014according to the sequence of events, with ''The Magician's Nephew'' being placed first\u2014and that of his mother, who thought the order of publication (with ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' being placed first) was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author may not be the best guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.<ref>Schakel, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nHowever publication order reflects Lewis's strategy for drawing readers into the world of Narnia. In the book he wrote first, [[Lucy Pevensie]]'s discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious lamp post creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in ''The Magician's Nephew'' and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe and the lamp post. Indeed, the narrative of ''The Magician's Nephew'' appears to assume that the reader has already read ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and is now being shown its beginnings.<ref>Schakel, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>\n\nPaul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology,<ref>Ford, pp. xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref> and continues, \"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions\".<ref>Ford, p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Allusions==\nLewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal.

S. Lewis's ''The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe'' is the theme of [[Christianity]]. Various aspects of characters and events in the novel reflect biblical ideas from Christianity. The lion [[Aslan]] is one of the largest examples, as his death is very similar to that of [[Jesus]] Christ. While many readers made this connection, Lewis denied that the themes of Christianity were intentional, saying that his writing began by picturing images of characters, and the rest just came about through the writing process.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\">{{Cite journal|title=Full Text Finder|doi=10.1353/sli.2013.0010}}</ref> While Lewis denied intentionally making the story a strictly Christian [[Theological fiction|theological novel]], he did admit that it could help young children accept Christianity into their lives when they were older.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=James|date=2009-09-27|title=Narnia as a Site of National Struggle: Marketing, Christianity, and National Purpose in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|journal=Cinema Journal|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=59\u201376|doi=10.1353/cj.0.0145|issn=1527-2087}}</ref>\n\nAfter the children enter the world of Narnia through the wardrobe, [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] finds himself in trouble under service of the [[White Witch]], as she tempts him with [[Turkish Delight]]s. When Edmund is threatened with death, Aslan offers to sacrifice himself instead. Aslan is shaved of his fur, and stabbed on an altar of stone. This is similar to how Jesus was publicly beaten, humiliated and crucified. After his sacrifice, Aslan is later reborn, and continues to help the children save Narnia.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\"/> While this sequence of events is comparable to the death of Jesus, it is not identical to it. There are a few differences, such as the fact that Aslan did not allow himself to be killed to save the entirety of Narnia, but only to save Edmund. Aslan is also only dead for one night, while Jesus returned on the third day.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/> Despite these differences, the image of Aslan and the event of his death and rebirth reflect those of the biblical account of Jesus' death and resurrection, adding to the theme of Christianity throughout the novel.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/>\n\n==Differences between editions==\nDue to labor union rules,<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book |title=Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe |last=Brown |first=Devin |year=2013 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0801065996 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801065996 }}</ref> the text of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was reset for the publication of the first American edition of by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]] in 1950.<ref name=LCC/> [[C.

In the [[frame story]], four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|wartime evacuation]]. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic of a [[wardrobe]] in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.\n\nLewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, [[Lucy Barfield]].

Lucy meets [[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]] who befriends her and informs her that she is in the land of Narnia. He invites her to have tea with him at his cave. Eventually, he reveals that he is in the pay of the [[White Witch]], a ruler who has kept Narnia frozen in a perpetual winter and who has given out orders that any human found in Narnia was to be captured and handed over to her. Tumnus then repents and realises that he cannot hand Lucy over to the Witch. He guides Lucy back to the lamppost. Once there, she returns to her own world by re-entering the wardrobe and finds that only a few seconds have passed there during her absence. None of her siblings believe her story about Narnia; upon inspection, the back of the wardrobe appears solid and leads nowhere. \n\nLucy enters the wardrobe again, and it again leads her into Narnia. This time, Edmund follows Lucy and also enters Narnia, but is unable to find his sister. Upon arriving in Narnia, Edmund encounters a great lady on a reindeer-drawn sleigh. She introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia, and plies him with sweet [[Turkish Delight]]. She is keen to find out as much as possible about Edmund, and is particularly interested in the fact that he has a brother and two sisters. She promises to reward Edmund with more Turkish Delight if he brings his brother and sisters to her house, and also promises to make him a prince and eventually King of Narnia. She then departs and when Edmund reaches the lamp-post, Lucy catches up with him. During their conversation about Narnia, Lucy tells Edmund that she has been to visit Tumnus the faun, and that the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting her go on her first visit. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund realises that the Witch is no other than the lady he has just made friends with, but he remains quiet about his meeting with her. When they returned to their own world, however, Edmund decides to make out that Lucy has been telling lies about the country in the wardrobe, much to her dismay. Peter is angry with Edmund for his supposed encouragement and jeering towards Lucy over her \"imaginary\" country, and quickly agrees with Susan that they need to speak to the professor, as they fear that Lucy is going mad. The professor, however, suggests that Lucy's story may well be true - particularly as Peter and Susan always saw her as the more honest sibling, and it is perfect obvious in the professor's opinion that Lucy is not mad. \n\nSoon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together while hiding in the wardrobe from the housekeeper, Mrs. Macready, who was giving a tour of the house to some visitors. Lucy leads the group to Tumnus's cave, only to find that it has been ransacked and that the faun is under arrest on a charge of treason against the Queen of Narnia (the White Witch), as mentioned in a letter signed by [[Maugrim]], chief of the White Witch's secret police. The children are befriended by [[Mr. Beaver]], a talking animal who takes them to his home. He informs them that Tumnus was last seen heading northwards - in the direction of the White Witch's castle - after being arrested by the secret police. His exact fate is unknown, but few people who have been taken into the castle have ever come out again - the courtyard, stairway and hall are reportedly full of statues of Narnians she has turned to stone. He and his wife tell the children about a prophecy that the Witch's tyranny will end when \"two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve\" sit on the four thrones of [[Cair Paravel]], and that Narnia's true ruler \u2014 the great lion [[Aslan]] \u2014 is at last arriving in Narnia, and they will be meeting him tomorrow at the Stone Table.\n\nEdmund slips away to the Witch's castle. In the courtyard, he is surprised by the many statues of Narnians the Witch has turned to stone. He first encounters Maugrim, who allows him to enter the castle. The Witch is furious that Edmund has come alone, and is angrier still to learn that Aslan \u2014 her enemy \u2014 has arrived in Narnia. She prepares to head to the Stone Table with Edmund in tow and her dwarf driving the sledge. She also orders Maugrim to take with him the swiftest of his wolves and kill Edmund's siblings and the beavers, and to head to the Stone Table if the children and beavers are already gone.\n\nMeanwhile, the children and the beavers notice Edmund's absence, and Mr Beaver was quick to reach the conclusion that Edmund had gone to the White Witch. They prepare for a long journey with the other children to meet Aslan. They finally reach a hiding place after walking for several miles in order to get some sleep. They are greeted the next morning by Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the Witch's magic - this is the first major sign that the Witch's power is crumbling. By the time they have reached the Stone Table to meet Aslan, the snow has melted and winter has ended. \n\n[[Maugrim]] then approaches the camp and attempts to attack Susan, but is killed by Peter. Aslan sends a rescue party for Edmund; it arrives just in time to save him from the Witch, who had decided to kill him. The Witch parleys with Aslan, invoking the \"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\" which gives her the right to kill Edmund for his treason. Aslan then speaks to the Witch alone, and on his return he announces that the Witch has renounced her claim on Edmund's life. Aslan and his followers then move the encampment on into the nearby forest.\n\nThat evening, Susan and Lucy follow Aslan, who leads them to the Stone Table. They watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death - as they had agreed in their pact to spare Edmund. After the Witch and her followers depart to prepare for battle against Aslan's followers, Susan and Lucy remain with Aslan's body. In the morning, the girls find the Stone Table broken and Aslan restored to life. Aslan explains that the \"Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time\" has the power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor. Aslan takes the girls to the Witch's house and revives the Narnians that the Witch had turned to stone, including Tumnus and a giant named Rumblebuffin. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch's army. The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.\n\nAfter a long and happy reign, the adult Pevensies go on a hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The four arrive at the lamppost and, having forgotten about it, unintentionally return through the wardrobe when they were looking for new adventures. When they return to England, they are children again, with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to the professor, who believes them and reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it.\n\n==Main characters==\n*[[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary protagonist of the story. She is the first to discover the land of Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe while exploring the Professor's house. When Lucy tells her three siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n*[[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned King Edmund the Just.\n*[[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of Edmund's. Tending to Aslan's carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavor to bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan the Gentle.\n*[[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude. Peter also disbelieves Lucy's stories about Narnia until he sees it for himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of [[Maugrim]] and for his command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent.\n*[[Aslan]], a [[lion]], is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and her minions. As the \"son of the Emperor beyond the sea\" (an allusion to [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical portrait, of [[Jesus|Christ]].<ref>Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in {{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Walter|title=The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III|year=2007|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-081922-4|page=1245}}</ref>\n*[[White Witch|The White Witch]] is the land's self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the story. Her spell on Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with her wand. She fears the fulfillment of a prophecy that \"two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve\" (meaning two male humans and two female humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as \"the White Witch\", or just \"the Witch\". Her actual name, \"Jadis,\" appears once in the notice left on Tumnus's door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a [[The Magician's Nephew|prequel]] to include her back story and account for her presence in the Narnian world.\n*[[Digory Kirke|The Professor]] is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of the series).\n*[[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]], is the first individual Lucy (who calls him \"Mr. Tumnus\") meets in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch's standing order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the Witch's forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund. The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later restored to life by Aslan.\n*[[Mr. and Mrs. Beaver]], two [[beaver]]s, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan and Lucy and lead them to Aslan.\n\n==Writing==\nLewis described the origin of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in an essay titled \"It All Began with a Picture\":<ref>Lewis (1960). \"It All Began with a Picture\". ''Radio Times''. 15 July 1960. In Hooper (1982), p. 53.</ref>\n:The ''Lion'' all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.

[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947 Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: \"I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.\"<ref>Lewis (2004 [1947]).

Nesbit]]\".<ref>Walsh, Chad (1974). ''C. S. Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics''. Norwood Editions. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-88305-779-4}}.</ref> After this conversation not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay \"It All Began With a Picture\" Lewis continues: \"At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\"<ref>Lewis (1960). In Hooper (1982), pp. xix, 53.</ref>\n\nThe major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written fourteen years earlier in his alliterative poem ''The Planets'':\n:...&nbsp;Of wrath ended\n:And woes mended, of winter passed\n:And guilt forgiven, and good fortune\n:[[Jupiter (mythology)|J<small>OVE</small>]] is master; and of jocund revel,\n:Laughter of ladies.

After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.<ref>Hooper, Walter. \"Lucy Barfield (1935\u20132003)\".

Lewis chose [[Pauline Baynes]], possibly based on [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]]'s recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis's appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after ''[[The Last Battle]]'' won the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for best children's book of 1956: \"is it not rather 'our' medal? I'm sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text\".<ref>Schakel 2002, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.<ref>Schakel 2002, p. 132.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nLewis very much enjoyed writing ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and embarked on the sequel ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late in 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.<ref>Veith, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nWhile Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children's writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated\u2014attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.<ref>Veith, p. 12.</ref>\n\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis's reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.<ref>Veith, p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn the United States a 2004 study found that ''The Lion'' was a common read-aloud book for seventh-graders in schools in [[San Diego County, California]].<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Fisher, Douglas, James Flood, Diane Lapp, and Nancy Frey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207031123/http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-07 |year=2004 |title= Interactive Read-Alouds: Is There a Common Set of Implementation Practices? |journal=[[The Reading Teacher]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages= 8\u201317|url= http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |accessdate= 2012-08-22 |doi=10.1598/RT.58.1.1}}</ref> In 2005 it was included on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'''s unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.<ref name=Time2005/> Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. [[National Education Association]] named it one of \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\".<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> In 2012 it was ranked number five among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'', a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.<ref name=SLJChapter2012>{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |title= Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= A Fuse #8 Production.

Most reprintings of the novels until the 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 [[HarperCollins]] published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in the novels. This meant ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' was numbered as the first in the series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of the novels outside the United States, also acquired the rights to publish the novels in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.<ref>Schakel, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nLaurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels\u2014according to the sequence of events, with ''The Magician's Nephew'' being placed first\u2014and that of his mother, who thought the order of publication (with ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' being placed first) was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author may not be the best guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.<ref>Schakel, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nHowever publication order reflects Lewis's strategy for drawing readers into the world of Narnia. In the book he wrote first, [[Lucy Pevensie]]'s discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious lamp post creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in ''The Magician's Nephew'' and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe and the lamp post. Indeed, the narrative of ''The Magician's Nephew'' appears to assume that the reader has already read ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and is now being shown its beginnings.<ref>Schakel, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>\n\nPaul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology,<ref>Ford, pp. xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref> and continues, \"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions\".<ref>Ford, p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Allusions==\nLewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo ''there''?\"<ref>James E. Higgins.

S. Lewis's ''The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe'' is the theme of [[Christianity]]. Various aspects of characters and events in the novel reflect biblical ideas from Christianity. The lion [[Aslan]] is one of the largest examples, as his death is very similar to that of [[Jesus]] Christ. While many readers made this connection, Lewis denied that the themes of Christianity were intentional, saying that his writing began by picturing images of characters, and the rest just came about through the writing process.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\">{{Cite journal|title=Full Text Finder|doi=10.1353/sli.2013.0010}}</ref> While Lewis denied intentionally making the story a strictly Christian [[Theological fiction|theological novel]], he did admit that it could help young children accept Christianity into their lives when they were older.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=James|date=2009-09-27|title=Narnia as a Site of National Struggle: Marketing, Christianity, and National Purpose in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|journal=Cinema Journal|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=59\u201376|doi=10.1353/cj.0.0145|issn=1527-2087}}</ref>\n\nAfter the children enter the world of Narnia through the wardrobe, [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] finds himself in trouble under service of the [[White Witch]], as she tempts him with [[Turkish Delight]]s. When Edmund is threatened with death, Aslan offers to sacrifice himself instead. Aslan is shaved of his fur, and stabbed on an altar of stone. This is similar to how Jesus was publicly beaten, humiliated and crucified. After his sacrifice, Aslan is later reborn, and continues to help the children save Narnia.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\"/> While this sequence of events is comparable to the death of Jesus, it is not identical to it. There are a few differences, such as the fact that Aslan did not allow himself to be killed to save the entirety of Narnia, but only to save Edmund. Aslan is also only dead for one night, while Jesus returned on the third day.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/> Despite these differences, the image of Aslan and the event of his death and rebirth reflect those of the biblical account of Jesus' death and resurrection, adding to the theme of Christianity throughout the novel.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/>\n\n==Differences between editions==\nDue to labor union rules,<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book |title=Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe |last=Brown |first=Devin |year=2013 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0801065996 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801065996 }}</ref> the text of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was reset for the publication of the first American edition of by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]] in 1950.<ref name=LCC/> [[C.
