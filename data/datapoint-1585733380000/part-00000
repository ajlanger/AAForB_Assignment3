Guignon, D. Pereboom. ''Existentialism: Basic Writings, 2nd ed.'', Hackett, 2001. pp. 101\u201313</ref> Nietzsche himself considered ''Zarathustra'' to be his magnum opus.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Nietzsche-Stein 01.jpg|thumb|right|Nietzsche wrote in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that the central idea of ''Zarathustra'' occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]].]]\n''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' was conceived while Nietzsche was writing ''[[The Gay Science]]''; he made a small note, reading \"6,000 feet beyond man and time\", as evidence of this.<ref>Gutmann, James. \"The \"Tremendous Moment\" of Nietzsche's Vision\". ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 51, No. 25. American Philosophical Association Eastern Division: Papers to be presented at the Fifty-First Annual Meeting, [[Goucher College]], December 28\u201330, 1954. pp. 837\u201342.</ref> More specifically, this note related to the concept of the [[Eternal Return|eternal recurrence]], which is, by Nietzsche's admission, the central idea of ''Zarathustra''; this idea occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]] in the [[Engadin|Upper Engadine]], a high alpine region whose valley floor is at {{convert|6000|ft|m}}. Nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years. He wrote that the ideas for ''Zarathustra'' first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding [[Rapallo]], according to [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] in the introduction of [[Thomas Common]]'s early translation of the book.\n\nAlthough Part Three was originally planned to be the end of the book, and ends with a strong [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts; ultimately, however, he composed only the fourth part, which is viewed to constitute an ''[[intermezzo]]''.\n\nNietzsche commented in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that for the completion of each part: \"Ten days sufficed; in no case, neither for the first nor for the third and last, did I require more\" (trans. Kaufmann). The first three parts were first published separately, and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part remained private after Nietzsche wrote it in 1885; a scant forty copies were all that were printed, apart from seven others that were distributed to Nietzsche's close friends. In March 1892, the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume. Since then, the version most commonly produced has included all four parts.\n\nThe original text contains a great deal of word-play. An example of this is the use of words beginning ''[[\u00fcber]]'' (\"over\" or \"above\") and ''unter'' (\"down\" or \"below\"), often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is ''Untergang'', literally \"down-going\" but used in German to mean \"setting\" (as of the sun) but also \"sinking\", \"demise\", \"downfall\" or \"doom\"; which Nietzsche pairs with its opposite ''\u00dcbergang'' (meaning \"transition\", literally \"over-going\"). Another example is ''\u00dcbermensch'' (overman or superman), discussed later in this article.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra's namesake was the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], usually known in English as [[Zoroaster]] ({{lang-ae|Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra}}). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a \"new\" or \"different\" Zarathustra, one who [[Transvaluation of values|turns traditional morality on its head]]. He goes on to characterize \"what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist:\"\n\n{{Quotation|For what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is ''his'' work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. [...] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the \"idealist\u201d who flees from reality [...]\u2014Am I understood?\u2014The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite\u2014into me\u2014that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.|Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', \"Why I Am a Destiny\", \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\n''Zarathustra'' has a simple characterisation and plot,<ref>Pippin, Robert. \"Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". ''Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy'', [[University of Chicago]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-521-60261-0}}. p. ix.</ref> narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented \"[[dithyramb]]s\" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]'' was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra's \"abundance\".\n\nSome speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a ''finale'' to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.\n\n''Zarathustra'' also contains the famous dictum \"[[God is dead]]\", which had appeared earlier in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. \"How One Becomes What One Is: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs\". (Edition) [[Random House]], 1974. p. xii.</ref> In his autobiographical work ''Ecce Homo'', [[Nietzsche]] states that the book's underlying concept is discussed within \"the penultimate section of the fourth book\" of 'The Gay Science' (''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Kaufmann). It is the [[eternal return|eternal recurrence of the same events]].\n\nThis concept first occurred to Nietzsche while he was walking in [[Switzerland]] through the woods along the lake of [[Silvaplana]] (close to [[Surlej]]); he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic, towering, pyramidal rock. Before ''Zarathustra'', Nietzsche had mentioned the concept in the fourth book of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (e.g., sect. 341); this was the first public proclamation of the notion by him. Apart from its salient presence in ''Zarathustra'', it is also echoed throughout Nietzsche's work. At any rate, it is by Zarathustra's transfiguration that he embraces eternity, that he at last ascertains \"the supreme will to power\".<ref>''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', sect. 617; trans. Kaufmann</ref> This inspiration finds its expression with [[Zarathustra's roundelay]], featured twice in the book, once near the story's close:\n{{cquote|O man, take care!<br>What does the deep midnight declare?<br>\"I was asleep\u2014<br>From a deep dream I woke and swear:\u2014<br>The world is deep,<br>Deeper than day had been aware.<br>Deep is its woe\u2014<br>Joy\u2014deeper yet than agony:<br>Woe implores: Go!<br>But all joy wants eternity\u2014<br>Wants deep, wants deep eternity.\"}}\n\nAnother singular feature of ''Zarathustra'', first presented in the prologue, is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the \"''[[\u00dcbermensch]]''\" (in English, either the \"overman\" or \"superman\"; or, ''superhuman'' or ''overhuman''. English translators Thomas Common and R. J. Hollingdale use ''superman'', while Kaufmann uses ''overman'', and Parkes uses ''overhuman''. Martin has opted to leave the nearly universally understood term as ''\u00dcbermensch'' in his new translation). The ''\u00dcbermensch'' is one of the many interconnecting, interdependent themes of the story, and is represented through several different metaphors. Examples include: the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud; or the sun's rise and culmination at its midday zenith; or a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss, moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the ''\u00dcbermensch''.\n\nThe symbol of the ''\u00dcbermensch'' also alludes to Nietzsche's notions of \"self-mastery\", \"self-cultivation\", \"self-direction\", and \"self-overcoming\". Expounding these concepts, Zarathustra declares:\n\n{{Quotation|\n\"''I teach you the overman''.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?\"\n<br /><br />\"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?\"\n<br /><br />\"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman ''shall be'' the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, ''remain faithful to the earth'', and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!\"|''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Prologue, \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nThe book embodies a number of innovative poetical and rhetorical methods of expression. It serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in Nietzsche's body of work. He has, however, said that \"among my writings my '''Zarathustra''' stands to my mind by itself\" (''Ecce Homo'', Preface, sec. 4, Kaufmann). Emphasizing its centrality and its status as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', Nietzsche stated that:\n\n{{Quotation|With [''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights\u2014the whole fact of man lies ''beneath'' it at a tremendous distance\u2014it is also the ''deepest'', born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.|''Ecce Homo'', Preface, \u00a74, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nSince many of the book's ideas are also present in his other works, ''Zarathustra'' is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought. With the book, Nietzsche embraced a distinct [[aesthetic]] assiduity. He later reformulated many of his ideas in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and various other writings that he composed thereafter. He continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns; generally, his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert \"[[nihilism]]\" in all of its varied forms.\n\nOther aspects of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' relate to Nietzsche's proposed \"[[Transvaluation of values|Transvaluation of All Values]]\". This incomplete project began with ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.\n\n==Themes==\nWhile Nietzsche injects myriad ideas into the book, a few recurring themes stand out.  The overman (\u00dcbermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.  Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman.\n\nThe [[eternal recurrence]], found elsewhere in Nietzsche's writing, is also mentioned.  \"Eternal recurrence\" is the possibility that all events in one's life will happen again and again, infinitely.  The embrace of all of life's horrors and pleasures alike shows a deference and acceptance of fate, or ''Amor Fati''.  The love and acceptance of one's path in life is a defining characteristic of the overman.  Faced with the knowledge that he would repeat every action that he has taken, an overman would be elated as he has no regrets and loves life.  Opting to change any decision or event in one's life would indicate the presence of resentment or fear; contradistinctly the overman is characterized by courage and a Dionysian spirit.\n\nThe [[will to power]] is the fundamental component of the human identity.  Everything we do is an expression of self-realization that can sometimes take a form of a will to power.  The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement.  Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.\n\nMany [[criticisms of Christianity]] can be found in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in particular Christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife.  The basis for his critique of Christianity lies in the perceived squandering of our earthly lives in pursuit of a perfect afterlife, of which there is no evidence.  This empiricist view (denial of afterlife) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text, but taken as a simple fact in Nietzsche's aphoristic writing style.  Judeo-Christian values are more thoroughly examined in ''On the Genealogy of Morals'' as a product of what he calls \"slave morality\".\n\n==Style==\nNoteworthy for its format, the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the [[New Testament]] and of the Platonic dialogues, at times resembling [[pre-Socratic]] works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices. It also features frequent references to the Western literary and philosophical traditions, implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems. Nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (referring to the traditional prophet of [[Zoroastrianism]]), who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas. This characteristic (following the genre of the ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') can be seen as an inline commentary on Zarathustra's (and Nietzsche's) philosophy. All this, along with the book's ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public, but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]]) until the second half of the twentieth century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style that does not distinguish between philosophy and literature.<ref>\nBehler, Ernst, ''Nietzsche in the Twentieth Century'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'', Magnus and Higgins (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 281\u2013319</ref> It offers formulations of eternal recurrence, and Nietzsche for the first time speaks of the ''\u00dcbermensch'': themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards.\n\nThe critic [[Harold Bloom]] criticized ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' in ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'' (1994), calling the book \"a gorgeous disaster\" and \"unreadable\".<ref name=\"Webster\">{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages |publisher=Riverhead Books |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 196, 422] |isbn=1-57322-514-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 }}</ref> Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche's style is intentionally [[Irony|ironic]] for much of the book.

Even the notion of eternal recurrence is treated playfully in a number of ambiguous references to the confusion of times. That a play upon the tropes should end with irony makes the fact of play itself unavoidable but it does not leave much standing in the way of straightforward doctrines or teachings\u2014just as the higher men must surrender their desperately gleaned fragments of doctrine for Zarathustra's dances.|jstor=302845}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\n\n* Alexander Tille, 1896\n* [[wikisource:Thus_Spake_Zarathustra|Thomas Common, 1909]]\n* Walter Kaufmann, 1954<ref name=\"portable\">{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans.

Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \"most evil\" and rendered it \"baddest\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \"baddest\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of ''[[The Genealogy of Morals]]'' to the difference between \"bad\" and \"evil\".<ref name=wk /> This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \"had little German and less English\".<ref name=wk /> The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.\n\nThomas Wayne, an English Professor at Edison State College in Fort Myers, Florida, published a translation in 2003.

''Existentialism: Basic Writings, 2nd ed.'', Hackett, 2001. pp. 101\u201313</ref> Zarathustra was considered to be his magnum opus by Nietzsche himself.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Nietzsche-Stein 01.jpg|thumb|right|Nietzsche wrote in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that the central idea of ''Zarathustra'' occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]].]]\n''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' was conceived while Nietzsche was writing ''[[The Gay Science]]''; he made a small note, reading \"6,000 feet beyond man and time\", as evidence of this.<ref>Gutmann, James. \"The \"Tremendous Moment\" of Nietzsche's Vision\". ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 51, No. 25. American Philosophical Association Eastern Division: Papers to be presented at the Fifty-First Annual Meeting, [[Goucher College]], December 28\u201330, 1954. pp. 837\u201342.</ref> More specifically, this note related to the concept of the [[Eternal Return|eternal recurrence]], which is, by Nietzsche's admission, the central idea of ''Zarathustra''; this idea occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]] in the [[Engadin|Upper Engadine]], a high alpine region whose valley floor is at {{convert|6000|ft|m}}. Nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years. He wrote that the ideas for ''Zarathustra'' first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding [[Rapallo]], according to [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] in the introduction of [[Thomas Common]]'s early translation of the book.\n\nAlthough Part Three was originally planned to be the end of the book, and ends with a strong [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts; ultimately, however, he composed only the fourth part, which is viewed to constitute an ''[[intermezzo]]''.\n\nNietzsche commented in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that for the completion of each part: \"Ten days sufficed; in no case, neither for the first nor for the third and last, did I require more\" (trans. Kaufmann). The first three parts were first published separately, and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part remained private after Nietzsche wrote it in 1885; a scant forty copies were all that were printed, apart from seven others that were distributed to Nietzsche's close friends. In March 1892, the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume. Since then, the version most commonly produced has included all four parts.\n\nThe original text contains a great deal of word-play. An example of this is the use of words beginning ''[[\u00fcber]]'' (\"over\" or \"above\") and ''unter'' (\"down\" or \"below\"), often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is ''Untergang'', literally \"down-going\" but used in German to mean \"setting\" (as of the sun) but also \"sinking\", \"demise\", \"downfall\" or \"doom\"; which Nietzsche pairs with its opposite ''\u00dcbergang'' (meaning \"transition\", literally \"over-going\"). Another example is ''\u00dcbermensch'' (overman or superman), discussed later in this article.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra's namesake was the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], usually known in English as [[Zoroaster]] ({{lang-ae|Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra}}). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a \"new\" or \"different\" Zarathustra, one who [[Transvaluation of values|turns traditional morality on its head]]. He goes on to characterize \"what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist:\"\n\n{{Quotation|For what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is ''his'' work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. [...] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the \"idealist\u201d who flees from reality [...]\u2014Am I understood?\u2014The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite\u2014into me\u2014that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.|Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', \"Why I Am a Destiny\", \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\n''Zarathustra'' has a simple characterisation and plot,<ref>Pippin, Robert. \"Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". ''Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy'', [[University of Chicago]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-521-60261-0}}. p. ix.</ref> narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented \"[[dithyramb]]s\" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]'' was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra's \"abundance\".\n\nSome speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a ''finale'' to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.\n\n''Zarathustra'' also contains the famous dictum \"[[God is dead]]\", which had appeared earlier in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. \"How One Becomes What One Is: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs\". (Edition) [[Random House]], 1974. p. xii.</ref> In his autobiographical work ''Ecce Homo'', [[Nietzsche]] states that the book's underlying concept is discussed within \"the penultimate section of the fourth book\" of 'The Gay Science' (''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Kaufmann). It is the [[eternal return|eternal recurrence of the same events]].\n\nThis concept first occurred to Nietzsche while he was walking in [[Switzerland]] through the woods along the lake of [[Silvaplana]] (close to [[Surlej]]); he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic, towering, pyramidal rock. Before ''Zarathustra'', Nietzsche had mentioned the concept in the fourth book of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (e.g., sect. 341); this was the first public proclamation of the notion by him. Apart from its salient presence in ''Zarathustra'', it is also echoed throughout Nietzsche's work. At any rate, it is by Zarathustra's transfiguration that he embraces eternity, that he at last ascertains \"the supreme will to power\".<ref>''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', sect. 617; trans. Kaufmann</ref> This inspiration finds its expression with [[Zarathustra's roundelay]], featured twice in the book, once near the story's close:\n{{cquote|O man, take care!<br>What does the deep midnight declare?<br>\"I was asleep\u2014<br>From a deep dream I woke and swear:\u2014<br>The world is deep,<br>Deeper than day had been aware.<br>Deep is its woe\u2014<br>Joy\u2014deeper yet than agony:<br>Woe implores: Go!<br>But all joy wants eternity\u2014<br>Wants deep, wants deep eternity.\"}}\n\nAnother singular feature of ''Zarathustra'', first presented in the prologue, is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the \"''[[\u00dcbermensch]]''\" (in English, either the \"overman\" or \"superman\"; or, ''superhuman'' or ''overhuman''. English translators Thomas Common and R. J. Hollingdale use ''superman'', while Kaufmann uses ''overman'', and Parkes uses ''overhuman''. Martin has opted to leave the nearly universally understood term as ''\u00dcbermensch'' in his new translation). The ''\u00dcbermensch'' is one of the many interconnecting, interdependent themes of the story, and is represented through several different metaphors. Examples include: the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud; or the sun's rise and culmination at its midday zenith; or a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss, moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the ''\u00dcbermensch''.\n\nThe symbol of the ''\u00dcbermensch'' also alludes to Nietzsche's notions of \"self-mastery\", \"self-cultivation\", \"self-direction\", and \"self-overcoming\". Expounding these concepts, Zarathustra declares:\n\n{{Quotation|\n\"''I teach you the overman''.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?\"\n<br /><br />\"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?\"\n<br /><br />\"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman ''shall be'' the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, ''remain faithful to the earth'', and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!\"|''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Prologue, \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nThe book embodies a number of innovative poetical and rhetorical methods of expression. It serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in Nietzsche's body of work. He has, however, said that \"among my writings my '''Zarathustra''' stands to my mind by itself\" (''Ecce Homo'', Preface, sec. 4, Kaufmann). Emphasizing its centrality and its status as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', Nietzsche stated that:\n\n{{Quotation|With [''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights\u2014the whole fact of man lies ''beneath'' it at a tremendous distance\u2014it is also the ''deepest'', born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.|''Ecce Homo'', Preface, \u00a74, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nSince many of the book's ideas are also present in his other works, ''Zarathustra'' is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought. With the book, Nietzsche embraced a distinct [[aesthetic]] assiduity. He later reformulated many of his ideas in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and various other writings that he composed thereafter. He continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns; generally, his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert \"[[nihilism]]\" in all of its varied forms.\n\nOther aspects of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' relate to Nietzsche's proposed \"[[Transvaluation of values|Transvaluation of All Values]]\". This incomplete project began with ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.\n\n==Themes==\nWhile Nietzsche injects myriad ideas into the book, a few recurring themes stand out.  The overman (\u00dcbermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.  Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman.\n\nThe [[eternal recurrence]], found elsewhere in Nietzsche's writing, is also mentioned.  \"Eternal recurrence\" is the possibility that all events in one's life will happen again and again, infinitely.  The embrace of all of life's horrors and pleasures alike shows a deference and acceptance of fate, or ''Amor Fati''.  The love and acceptance of one's path in life is a defining characteristic of the overman.  Faced with the knowledge that he would repeat every action that he has taken, an overman would be elated as he has no regrets and loves life.  Opting to change any decision or event in one's life would indicate the presence of resentment or fear; contradistinctly the overman is characterized by courage and a Dionysian spirit.\n\nThe [[will to power]] is the fundamental component of the human identity.  Everything we do is an expression of self-realization that can sometimes take a form of a will to power.  The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement.  Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.\n\nMany [[criticisms of Christianity]] can be found in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in particular Christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife.  The basis for his critique of Christianity lies in the perceived squandering of our earthly lives in pursuit of a perfect afterlife, of which there is no evidence.  This empiricist view (denial of afterlife) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text, but taken as a simple fact in Nietzsche's aphoristic writing style.  Judeo-Christian values are more thoroughly examined in ''On the Genealogy of Morals'' as a product of what he calls \"slave morality\".\n\n==Style==\nNoteworthy for its format, the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the [[New Testament]] and of the Platonic dialogues, at times resembling [[pre-Socratic]] works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices. It also features frequent references to the Western literary and philosophical traditions, implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems. Nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (referring to the traditional prophet of [[Zoroastrianism]]), who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas. This characteristic (following the genre of the ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') can be seen as an inline commentary on Zarathustra's (and Nietzsche's) philosophy. All this, along with the book's ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public, but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]]) until the second half of the twentieth century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style that does not distinguish between philosophy and literature.<ref>\nBehler, Ernst, ''Nietzsche in the Twentieth Century'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'', Magnus and Higgins (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 281\u2013319</ref> It offers formulations of eternal recurrence, and Nietzsche for the first time speaks of the ''\u00dcbermensch'': themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards.\n\nThe critic [[Harold Bloom]] criticized ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' in ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'' (1994), calling the book \"a gorgeous disaster\" and \"unreadable\".<ref name=\"Webster\">{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages |publisher=Riverhead Books |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 196, 422] |isbn=1-57322-514-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 }}</ref> Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche's style is intentionally [[Irony|ironic]] for much of the book.

Even the notion of eternal recurrence is treated playfully in a number of ambiguous references to the confusion of times. That a play upon the tropes should end with irony makes the fact of play itself unavoidable but it does not leave much standing in the way of straightforward doctrines or teachings\u2014just as the higher men must surrender their desperately gleaned fragments of doctrine for Zarathustra's dances.|jstor=302845}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\n\n* Alexander Tille, 1896\n* [[wikisource:Thus_Spake_Zarathustra|Thomas Common, 1909]]\n* Walter Kaufmann, 1954<ref name=\"portable\">{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans.

Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \"most evil\" and rendered it \"baddest\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \"baddest\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of ''[[The Genealogy of Morals]]'' to the difference between \"bad\" and \"evil\".<ref name=wk /> This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \"had little German and less English\".<ref name=wk /> The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.\n\nThomas Wayne, an English Professor at Edison State College in Fort Myers, Florida, published a translation in 2003.
