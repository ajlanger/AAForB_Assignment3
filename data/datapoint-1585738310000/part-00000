Philippines being part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and continued to serve as a [[lingua franca]] until the first half of the 20th century. It was first introduced to the Philippines in 1565, when the conquistador [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] founded the first Spanish settlement on the island of [[Cebu Island|Ceb\u00fa]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|pp=7\u201311}}</ref> The Philippines, ruled first from [[Mexico City]] and later from [[Madrid]], was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish territory]] for 333 years (1565\u20131898).<ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=80, 212}}</ref> Schooling was a priority, however. The [[Augustinians]] opened a school immediately upon arriving in Ceb\u00fa in 1565; the [[Franciscan]]s followed suit when they arrived in 1577, as did the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] when they arrived in 1587. Besides religious instruction, these schools taught how to read and write and imparted industrial and agricultural techniques.<ref name=Arcilla1994p50>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=50}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the stance of the Roman Catholic Church and its [[missionary|missionaries]] was to preach to the natives in local languages, not in Spanish.  The priests learned the native languages and sometimes employed indigenous peoples as [[translator]]s, creating a bilingual class known as Ladinos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |title=Language and Desire in Hiligaynon|work=[http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers.html Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics] |first=Coraz\u00f3n |last=Villareal |date=January 17\u201320, 2006 |location=Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines |page=9 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111134034/http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |archivedate=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |quote=But the real authors were really the Ladinos, natives from the Philippine who were the informants, translators, or even better, consultants of the missionaries.}}</ref> Before the 19th century, the natives generally were not taught Spanish. However, there were notable bilingual individuals such as poet-translator [[Gaspar Aquino de Bel\u00e9n]]. Gaspar produced Christian devotional poetry written in the Roman script in the [[Tagalog language]]. [[Pasyon]] is a narrative of the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ begun by Gaspar Aquino de Bel\u00e9n, which has circulated in many versions. Later, the Spanish-Mexican ballads of chivalry, the [[corrido]], provided a model for secular literature. Verse narratives, or komedya, were performed in the [[Philippine languages|regional languages]] for the illiterate majority.\n\nIn the early 17th century, a Tagalog-Chinese printer, Tom\u00e1s Pinpin, set out to write a book in romanized phonetic script to teach the Tagalogs how to learn [[Names given to the Spanish language|Castilian]]. His book, published by the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] press where he worked, appeared in 1610, the same year as Blancas's ''Arte''. Unlike the missionary's grammar (which Pinpin had set in type), the Tagalog native's book dealt with the language of the dominant rather than the subordinate other. Pinpin's book was the first such work ever written and published by a Philippine native. As such, it is richly instructive for what it tells us about the interests that animated Tagalog translation and, by implication, Tagalog conversion in the early colonial period.\n\n[[Image:La Illustracion Filipina (1892).jpg|thumb|left|[[Juan Luna]] featured on the cover of a Philippine periodical in Spanish]]\nBy law, each town had to build two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, to teach the Spanish language and the [[catechism|Christian catechism]]. There were never enough trained teachers, however, and several provincial schools were mere sheds open to the rain. This discouraged the attendance at school and illiteracy was high in the provinces until the 19th century, when public education was introduced. The conditions were better in larger towns. To qualify as an independent civil town, a [[barrio]] or group of barrios had to have a priest's residence, a town hall, boys' and girls' schools; streets had to be straight and at right angles to one another so that the town could grow in size; the town had to be near a good water source and land for farming and grazing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=48}}</ref>\n\nBetter school conditions in towns and cities led to more effective instruction in the Spanish language and in other subjects. Between 1600 and 1865, a number of colleges and universities were established, which graduated many important colonial officials and church prelates, bishops, and archbishops\u2014several of whom served the churches in [[Hispanic America]]. The increased level of education eventually led to the rise of the [[Ilustrados]]. In 1846, French traveler [[Jean Baptiste Mallat]] was surprised at how advanced Philippine schools were.<ref name=Arcilla1994p50 /> In 1865, the government inaugurated the Escuela Normal (''Normal School'', later [[Philippine Normal University]]), an institute to train future primary school teachers. At the same time, primary schooling was made compulsory for all children. In 1869, a new Spanish constitution brought to the Philippines universal suffrage and a free press.<ref>{{cite web | last = Beck | first = Sanderson | title =Summary and Evaluation | url=http://www.san.beck.org/21-Summary.html#a6 | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref> ''El Bolet\u00edn de Ceb\u00fa'', the first Spanish newspaper in [[Cebu City]], was published in 1886.<ref>{{cite web | title =Newspaper | url=http://www.ngkhai.com/pointcebu/culture/newspaper.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref>\n\nIn Manila, the Spanish language had been more or less widespread, to the point where it has been estimated at around 50% of the population knew Spanish in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Rodr\u00edguez-Ponga\">{{Harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez-Ponga}}</ref> In his 1898 book \"Yesterdays in the Philippines\", covering a period beginning in 1893, the American [[Joseph Earle Stevens]], an American who resided in Manila from 1893 to 1894, wrote:\n{{quote|\nSpanish, of course, is the court and commercial language and, except among the uneducated native who have a lingua of their own or among the few members of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] colony, it has a monopoly everywhere.

These schools and universities played a crucial role in the development of the Spanish language in the islands. Colegio de Manila in [[Intramuros]] was founded in 1590. The Colegio formally opened in 1595, and was one of the first schools in the Philippines.<ref name=\"ateneo\">{{cite web | title =The First Hundred Years Of The Ateneo de Manila | url=http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=348 | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref> During the same year, the [[University of San Carlos]] in Ceb\u00fa, was established as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by the Jesuits. In 1611, the [[University of Santo Tom\u00e1s]], considered as the oldest existing university in Asia, was inaugurated in Manila by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. In the 18th century, fluent male Spanish speakers in the Philippines were generally the graduates of these schools, as well as of the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letr\u00e1n]], established in 1620. In 1706, a convent school for Philippine women known as Beaterios was established. It admitted both Spanish and native girls, and taught Religion, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic with Music and Embroidery. Female graduates from Beaterios were fluent in the language as well. In 1859, [[Ateneo de Manila University]] was established by the [[Jesuits]] as the Escuela Municipal.<ref name=\"ateneo\"/>\n\nIn 1863, Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]] decreed the establishment of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system, following the requests of the Spanish authorities in the islands, who saw the need of teaching Spanish to the wider population. The primary instruction and the teaching of the Spanish language was compulsory. The Educational Decree provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town and governed by the municipal government. A Normal School for male teachers was established and was supervised by the Jesuits.<ref>{{cite web  | title =Historical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System  | url =http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | accessdate =2010-06-29  | url-status =dead  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160809/http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | archivedate =2011-07-16  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = EDUCATION | url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref> In 1866, the total population of the Philippines was only 4,411,261.

While widely understood by the majority of the population, Spanish at this time was the unifying language since Tagalog was not as prominent or ubiquitous as it is today and each region had their own culture and language, and would rather speak in their local languages. Before the spread of Filipino nationalism, the natives of each region still thought of themselves as [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Waray people|Waray]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] etc., and not as Filipinos.\n\nThe term \"Filipino\" originally referred to the natives of the Philippines themselves. It was Pedro Chirino, a Spanish Jesuit, who first called the natives \"Filipinos,\" in his book ''Relaci\u00f3n de las Islas Filipinas'' (Rome, 1604). However, during their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers preferred to call the natives ''Indios''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonroyeca.blogspot.com/2012/11/sino-ang-mga-orihinal-na-pilipino.html|title=Jon E.

Peoples born in Spanish America or in the North American continent of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] who were residing in the Philippines were collectively referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Americanos]]. The Catholic [[Austronesian peoples]] of the Philippines were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Indios]] and for those who were practicing the [[Islamic faith]], [[Moro people|Moros]]. The indigenous [[Aeta peoples|Aetas]] were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Negritos]]. [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] settlers were called [[Sangley]]es. Japanese settlers were called [[Japanese settlement in the Philippines|Japoneses]]. Those of mixed ancestry were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Mestizos]] or [[Tornatr\u00e1s]]. In the 1800s, the term \"Filipino\" gradually became synonymous to anyone born in the Philippines regardless of ethnicity through the effort of the [[Criollo people|Insulares]], from whom, [[Filipino nationalism]] began.\n\nIn 1863, the Spanish language was taught freely when a primary public school system was set up for the entire population. The Spanish-speaking [[Ilustrados]] (The Enlightened Ones), which included the Insulares, the Indios, the Mestizos, the Tornatr\u00e1s, etc., were the educated elite who promoted and propagated nationalism and a modern Filipino consciousness. The Ilustrados and later writers formed the basis of [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Philippine Classical Literature]] which developed in the 19th century.\n\nJos\u00e9 Rizal propagated Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish. One material highly instrumental in developing nationalism was the novels entitled ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' which exposed the abuses of the colonial government and clergy composed of Peninsulares. The novels' very own notoriety propelled its popularity even more among Filipinos. Reading it was forbidden because it exposed and parodied the Peninsulares in the Philippine Islands.\n\n===Philippine\u2013American War===\n\n{{See also|Philippine\u2013American War}}\n\nThe revolutionary [[First Philippine Republic|Malolos Republic]] of 1899 designated the Spanish language for official use in its [[Malolos Constitution|constitution]], drawn up during the Constitutional Convention in [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]].<ref name=1897and1899 /><ref name=\"statistics\"/><ref>{{cite web | title =1899 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines Title XIV Article 93 | url=http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1899-constitution.html | accessdate = 2012-01-01}}</ref> During this period, the nascent republic published a number of laws, acts, decrees, and other official issuances.

Philippines being part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and continued to serve as a [[lingua franca]] until the first half of the 20th century. It was first introduced to the Philippines in 1565, when the conquistador [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] founded the first Spanish settlement on the island of [[Cebu Island|Ceb\u00fa]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|pp=7\u201311}}</ref> The Philippines, ruled first from [[Mexico City]] and later from [[Madrid]], was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish territory]] for 333 years (1565\u20131898).<ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=80, 212}}</ref> Schooling was a priority, however. The [[Augustinians]] opened a school immediately upon arriving in Ceb\u00fa in 1565; the [[Franciscan]]s followed suit when they arrived in 1577, as did the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] when they arrived in 1587. Besides religious instruction, these schools taught how to read and write and imparted industrial and agricultural techniques.<ref name=Arcilla1994p50>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=50}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the stance of the Roman Catholic Church and its [[missionary|missionaries]] was to preach to the natives in local languages, not in Spanish.  The priests learned the native languages and sometimes employed indigenous peoples as [[translator]]s, creating a bilingual class known as Ladinos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |title=Language and Desire in Hiligaynon|work=[http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers.html Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics] |first=Coraz\u00f3n |last=Villareal |date=January 17\u201320, 2006 |location=Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines |page=9 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111134034/http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |archivedate=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |quote=But the real authors were really the Ladinos, natives from the Philippine who were the informants, translators, or even better, consultants of the missionaries.}}</ref> Before the 19th century, the natives generally were not taught Spanish. However, there were notable bilingual individuals such as poet-translator [[Gaspar Aquino de Bel\u00e9n]]. Gaspar produced Christian devotional poetry written in the Roman script in the [[Tagalog language]]. [[Pasyon]] is a narrative of the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ begun by Gaspar Aquino de Bel\u00e9n, which has circulated in many versions. Later, the Spanish-Mexican ballads of chivalry, the [[corrido]], provided a model for secular literature. Verse narratives, or komedya, were performed in the [[Philippine languages|regional languages]] for the illiterate majority.\n\nIn the early 17th century, a Tagalog-Chinese printer, Tom\u00e1s Pinpin, set out to write a book in romanized phonetic script to teach the Tagalogs how to learn [[Names given to the Spanish language|Castilian]]. His book, published by the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] press where he worked, appeared in 1610, the same year as Blancas's ''Arte''. Unlike the missionary's grammar (which Pinpin had set in type), the Tagalog native's book dealt with the language of the dominant rather than the subordinate other. Pinpin's book was the first such work ever written and published by a Philippine native. As such, it is richly instructive for what it tells us about the interests that animated Tagalog translation and, by implication, Tagalog conversion in the early colonial period.\n\n[[Image:La Illustracion Filipina (1892).jpg|thumb|left|[[Juan Luna]] featured on the cover of a Philippine periodical in Spanish]]\nBy law, each town had to build two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, to teach the Spanish language and the [[catechism|Christian catechism]]. There were never enough trained teachers, however, and several provincial schools were mere sheds open to the rain. This discouraged the attendance at school and illiteracy was high in the provinces until the 19th century, when public education was introduced. The conditions were better in larger towns. To qualify as an independent civil town, a [[barrio]] or group of barrios had to have a priest's residence, a town hall, boys' and girls' schools; streets had to be straight and at right angles to one another so that the town could grow in size; the town had to be near a good water source and land for farming and grazing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=48}}</ref>\n\nBetter school conditions in towns and cities led to more effective instruction in the Spanish language and in other subjects. Between 1600 and 1865, a number of colleges and universities were established, which graduated many important colonial officials and church prelates, bishops, and archbishops\u2014several of whom served the churches in [[Hispanic America]]. The increased level of education eventually led to the rise of the [[Ilustrados]]. In 1846, French traveler [[Jean Baptiste Mallat]] was surprised at how advanced Philippine schools were.<ref name=Arcilla1994p50 /> In 1865, the government inaugurated the Escuela Normal (''Normal School'', later [[Philippine Normal University]]), an institute to train future primary school teachers. At the same time, primary schooling was made compulsory for all children. In 1869, a new Spanish constitution brought to the Philippines universal suffrage and a free press.<ref>{{cite web | last = Beck | first = Sanderson | title =Summary and Evaluation | url=http://www.san.beck.org/21-Summary.html#a6 | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref> ''El Bolet\u00edn de Ceb\u00fa'', the first Spanish newspaper in [[Cebu City]], was published in 1886.<ref>{{cite web | title =Newspaper | url=http://www.ngkhai.com/pointcebu/culture/newspaper.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref>\n\nIn Manila, the Spanish language had been more or less widespread, to the point where it has been estimated at around 50% of the population knew Spanish in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Rodr\u00edguez-Ponga\">{{Harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez-Ponga}}</ref> In his 1898 book \"Yesterdays in the Philippines\", covering a period beginning in 1893, the American [[Joseph Earle Stevens]], an American who resided in Manila from 1893 to 1894, wrote:\n{{quote|\nSpanish, of course, is the court and commercial language and, except among the uneducated native who have a lingua of their own or among the few members of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] colony, it has a monopoly everywhere.

By the end of the 19th century, Spanish was a strong second language among the upper classes of Philippine society, having been learned in childhood either directly from parents and grandparents or through tutoring by a local priest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul A.

These schools and universities played a crucial role in the development of the Spanish language in the islands. Colegio de Manila in [[Intramuros]] was founded in 1590. The Colegio formally opened in 1595, and was one of the first schools in the Philippines.<ref name=\"ateneo\">{{cite web | title =The First Hundred Years Of The Ateneo de Manila | url=http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=348 | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref> During the same year, the [[University of San Carlos]] in Ceb\u00fa, was established as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by the Jesuits. In 1611, the [[University of Santo Tom\u00e1s]], considered as the oldest existing university in Asia, was inaugurated in Manila by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. In the 18th century, fluent male Spanish speakers in the Philippines were generally the graduates of these schools, as well as of the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letr\u00e1n]], established in 1620. In 1706, a convent school for Philippine women known as Beaterios was established. It admitted both Spanish and native girls, and taught Religion, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic with Music and Embroidery. Female graduates from Beaterios were fluent in the language as well. In 1859, [[Ateneo de Manila University]] was established by the [[Jesuits]] as the Escuela Municipal.<ref name=\"ateneo\"/>\n\nIn 1863, Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]] decreed the establishment of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system, following the requests of the Spanish authorities in the islands, who saw the need of teaching Spanish to the wider population. The primary instruction and the teaching of the Spanish language was compulsory. The Educational Decree provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town and governed by the municipal government. A Normal School for male teachers was established and was supervised by the Jesuits.<ref>{{cite web  | title =Historical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System  | url =http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | accessdate =2010-06-29  | url-status =dead  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160809/http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | archivedate =2011-07-16  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = EDUCATION | url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}</ref> In 1866, the total population of the Philippines was only 4,411,261.

This class of writers, poets and intellectuals is often referred to as [[Ilustrados]]. Ironically, it was during the initial years of American occupation in the early 20th century, that Spanish literature and press flourished.

While widely understood by the majority of the population, Spanish at this time was the unifying language since Tagalog was not as prominent or ubiquitous as it is today and each region had their own culture and language, and would rather speak in their local languages. Before the spread of Filipino nationalism, the natives of each region still thought of themselves as [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Waray people|Waray]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] etc., and not as Filipinos.\n\nThe term \"Filipino\" originally referred to the natives of the Philippines themselves. It was Pedro Chirino, a Spanish Jesuit, who first called the natives \"Filipinos,\" in his book ''Relaci\u00f3n de las Islas Filipinas'' (Rome, 1604). However, during their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers preferred to call the natives ''Indios''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonroyeca.blogspot.com/2012/11/sino-ang-mga-orihinal-na-pilipino.html|title=Jon E.

Peoples born in Spanish America or in the North American continent of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] who were residing in the Philippines were collectively referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Americanos]]. The Catholic [[Austronesian peoples]] of the Philippines were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Indios]] and for those who were practicing the [[Islamic faith]], [[Moro people|Moros]]. The indigenous [[Aeta peoples|Aetas]] were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Negritos]]. [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] settlers were called [[Sangley]]es. Japanese settlers were called [[Japanese settlement in the Philippines|Japoneses]]. Those of mixed ancestry were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Mestizos]] or [[Tornatr\u00e1s]]. In the 1800s, the term \"Filipino\" gradually became synonymous to anyone born in the Philippines regardless of ethnicity through the effort of the [[Criollo people|Insulares]], from whom, [[Filipino nationalism]] began.\n\nIn 1863, the Spanish language was taught freely when a primary public school system was set up for the entire population. The Spanish-speaking [[Ilustrados]] (The Enlightened Ones), which included the Insulares, the Indios, the Mestizos, the Tornatr\u00e1s, etc., were the educated elite who promoted and propagated nationalism and a modern Filipino consciousness. The Ilustrados and later writers formed the basis of [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Philippine Classical Literature]] which developed in the 19th century.\n\nJos\u00e9 Rizal propagated Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish.
