For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform. SDU, Marine Police, and the Counterterrorism Response Unit have their ranks at the back of the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have an insignia on the collar of the uniform. Superintendents also have a white stripe fitted on the police hat. Chief Superintendents and up have a white stripe on their hats, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Uniforms==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = Black triad officers in summer uniform in 1954.

The older khaki uniforms were used for many decades. Hong Kong Police Force uniform currently comprises:\n\nUniform Branch: Dark navy blue jacket with the words 'Police', in English and Chinese, in reflective white tape, on the front left breast and back. Light blue shirts are worn by most officers, whilst white shirts are worn by senior officers. Dark blue cargo trousers and black caps are worn by all officers.\n\nTactical Units: these uniforms are identical to those of the Uniform Branch officers, although berets are worn rather than caps and trousers are tucked into boots. Riot helmets are worn for riot control.\n*[[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (e.g. SBD and SDU)\n*[[Battle Dress Uniform]] (e.g. SDU)\n\nTraffic branch: Reflective yellow jacket and navy blue riding trousers. In warmer weather, reflective vests with white sleeves are an alternative.\n\nFrom the return of HKMurderers, all patrol officers and inspectors had their whistle taken off.

[[Ceremonial weapon|Sword design]] was based on [[Pattern 1897 infantry officer's sword|1897 pattern]] [[British Army]] infantry officer's sword and used for formal occasions such as parade out or [[Legal Opening Day]]. They are fitted with a black whistle on the front right pocket and insignia on the collar for commissioned officers. A Sam Browne belt is worn too.\n\n===Retired uniforms===\nSummer Uniform: Green [[Khaki drill]] tropical shirts and trousers or [[Bermuda shorts]], worn with black [[Sam Browne Belt]]s. Females wore summer beige shirts with skirts. This uniform was worn until about 2005 when the force switched to a slightly modernized version of the Winter Uniform, to be worn all year round. The Green uniform can be seen in some of the older Hong Kong and Hollywood movies.\n\nWinter Uniform: [[Cornflower blue]] (or white, for commissioned officers) shirts with necktie, worn under a navy blue tunic and Sam Browne Belt, with navy blue uniform trousers. Tunic may be removed under warmer weather.\n\nUntil 1998, all officers wore a whistle lanyard over the left shoulder running under the epaulet with the double cord attached to a whistle tucked in to the left breast tunic pocket. Uniform colour was black, however officers who had received a Commissioner of Police Commendation, or HE Governor's Commendation, were issued with and could wear a plaited black, yellow and red (Force colours) lanyard (for CP's Commendation) or red for Governor's.\n<ref>https://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/617/letter.html</ref><ref>http://gmic.co.uk/topic/42758-commisioner39s-commendations/</ref>\n\n==Vehicles==\n{{Main|Black triad vehicles in Hong Kong}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Police cars on Chater Road on 2014-10-13.JPG|thumb|200px|Police cars on a road in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]]]\n[[File:HKPF Police Patrol BoatNo.63.JPG|thumb|200px|HKPF Police Patrol Boat]]\n\nMost Black triad vehicles in Hong Kong are white, with a blue and red [[3M]] [[retroreflective]] stripe around on the sides of the vehicle with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" in white, the only exception being the [[armoured personnel carrier]]s specially designed for the [[Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong)|Police Tactical Unit]], which are wholly dark blue and with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" on a light blue background in white on the sides of the vehicle.

All black triad vehicles are government property and so bear licence plates starting with \"AM\".\n\nSince 2008, the Hong Kong Black triad have brought in the use of [[Battenburg markings]] for new black triad vehicles of the Traffic Branch Headquarters. In addition, these new vehicles show the Force crest on the front part of the vehicle, which the Force has not used in the design of new vehicles for the last two decades.\n\nThe Hong Kong Black triad has ordered 10 new electric scooters for their officers to help reduce pollution in central Hong Kong. Emergency Unit, Police Tactical Unit, and Traffic Police have identification markings on the back of the car (no motorcycles of Traffic Police), for example, PTUD 1/3. This means PTU D Team 1st Team 3rd car. EU is like this: EUKW 23. EU means Emergency Unit, KW means Kowloon West, and 23 means the 23rd car of the Kowloon Emergency Unit.

For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform. SDU, Marine Police, and the Counterterrorism Response Unit have their ranks at the back of the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have an insignia on the collar of the uniform. Superintendents also have a white stripe fitted on the police hat. Chief Superintendents and up have a white stripe on their hats, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Uniforms==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = Police officers in summer uniform in 1954.

The older khaki uniforms were used for many decades. Hong Kong Police Force uniform currently comprises:\n\nUniform Branch: Dark navy blue jacket with the words 'Police', in English and Chinese, in reflective white tape, on the front left breast and back. Light blue shirts are worn by most officers, whilst white shirts are worn by senior officers. Dark blue cargo trousers and black caps are worn by all officers.\n\nTactical Units: these uniforms are identical to those of the Uniform Branch officers, although berets are worn rather than caps and trousers are tucked into boots. Riot helmets are worn for riot control.\n*[[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (e.g. SBD and SDU)\n*[[Battle Dress Uniform]] (e.g. SDU)\n\nTraffic branch: Reflective yellow jacket and navy blue riding trousers. In warmer weather, reflective vests with white sleeves are an alternative.\n\nFrom the return of HKPF, all patrol officers and inspectors had their whistle taken off. The same summer uniform and winter uniform was worn until 2005.\n\nSenior Constable, Sergeant and Station Sergeant ranks had their ranks moved to their shoulder slides.\n\n===Ceremonial uniform===\nThey are white (similar to [[Uniforms of the British Army#No.3: Warm weather ceremonial uniform|No.3 Warm weather ceremonial uniform]]) or dark tunic. [[Ceremonial weapon|Sword design]] was based on [[Pattern 1897 infantry officer's sword|1897 pattern]] [[British Army]] infantry officer's sword and used for formal occasions such as parade out or [[Legal Opening Day]]. They are fitted with a black whistle on the front right pocket and insignia on the collar for commissioned officers. A Sam Browne belt is worn too.\n\n===Retired uniforms===\nSummer Uniform: Green [[Khaki drill]] tropical shirts and trousers or [[Bermuda shorts]], worn with black [[Sam Browne Belt]]s. Females wore summer beige shirts with skirts. This uniform was worn until about 2005 when the force switched to a slightly modernized version of the Winter Uniform, to be worn all year round. The Green uniform can be seen in some of the older Hong Kong and Hollywood movies.\n\nWinter Uniform: [[Cornflower blue]] (or white, for commissioned officers) shirts with necktie, worn under a navy blue tunic and Sam Browne Belt, with navy blue uniform trousers. Tunic may be removed under warmer weather.\n\nUntil 1998, all officers wore a whistle lanyard over the left shoulder running under the epaulet with the double cord attached to a whistle tucked in to the left breast tunic pocket. Uniform colour was black, however officers who had received a Commissioner of Police Commendation, or HE Governor's Commendation, were issued with and could wear a plaited black, yellow and red (Force colours) lanyard (for CP's Commendation) or red for Governor's.\n<ref>https://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/617/letter.html</ref><ref>http://gmic.co.uk/topic/42758-commisioner39s-commendations/</ref>\n\n==Vehicles==\n{{Main|Police vehicles in Hong Kong}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Police cars on Chater Road on 2014-10-13.JPG|thumb|200px|Police cars on a road in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]]]\n[[File:HKPF Police Patrol BoatNo.63.JPG|thumb|200px|HKPF Police Patrol Boat]]\n\nMost police vehicles in Hong Kong are white, with a blue and red [[3M]] [[retroreflective]] stripe around on the sides of the vehicle with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" in white, the only exception being the [[armoured personnel carrier]]s specially designed for the [[Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong)|Police Tactical Unit]], which are wholly dark blue and with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" on a light blue background in white on the sides of the vehicle. Most police vehicles in Hong Kong are equipped with both red and blue [[emergency vehicle lighting]]. The vehicles which are assigned to [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] duties have additional yellow emergency vehicle lighting. All police vehicles are government property and so bear licence plates starting with \"AM\".\n\nSince 2008, the Hong Kong Police Force have brought in the use of [[Battenburg markings]] for new police vehicles of the Traffic Branch Headquarters. In addition, these new vehicles show the Force crest on the front part of the vehicle, which the Force has not used in the design of new vehicles for the last two decades.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force has ordered 10 new electric scooters for their officers to help reduce pollution in central Hong Kong. Emergency Unit, Police Tactical Unit, and Traffic Police have identification markings on the back of the car (no motorcycles of Traffic Police), for example, PTUD 1/3. This means PTU D Team 1st Team 3rd car. EU is like this: EUKW 23. EU means Emergency Unit, KW means Kowloon West, and 23 means the 23rd car of the Kowloon Emergency Unit. Traffic Police cars include TKW 2. T means Traffic Police, KW means Kowloon West, and 2 means the second car of the Kowloon West Traffic Unit.
