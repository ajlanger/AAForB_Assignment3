[[Discovery Island Marine Provincial Park]] occupies the southern portion of Discovery Island, {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of Oak Bay. The northern portion of the island is part of Discovery Island Indian Reserve 3, under the control of the [[Songhees First Nation]].\n\nDiscovery island was named in 1846 by surveyors in honour of [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']], the ship used by 18th-century British Explorer [[Captain George Vancouver]] to chart the [[British Columbia Coast|coastline of British Columbia]] between 1792 and 1794 (see the [[Vancouver Expedition]]). The adjacent [[Chatham Islands (British Columbia)|Chatham Islands]] were named after his escort ship, [[HMS Chatham (1788)|HMS ''Chatham'']].\n\nThe [[Discovery Island Lighthouse|Lighthouse]] at Sea Bird Point, the eastern end of Discovery Island, marks the junction of the [[Haro Strait|Haro]] and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|Juan De Fuca Straits]]. These two straits form the border between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The lighthouse was built in 1886 and manned for 110 years before being fully automated in 1996. The island has two homes for light keepers families, a helicopter pad, a diesel power generation station, a well, a water reservoir, a boathouse and dock. The coast guard used to keep a truck on the island. Sea Bird Point was named after an American paddle steamer which caught fire and was run aground in 1858 to save the lives of the crew.\n\nDesignated as a park in 1972, the uninhabited and undeveloped 61-hectare [[Discovery Island Marine Provincial Park]] was once inhabited by [[Songhees|First Nations]] people and resident lighthouse keepers. The island was once the home of [[Captain E.G. Beaumont]], who purchased part of the island in 1918. He died in 1967 after living on Discovery Island with his wife for nearly half a century. Beaumont owned roughly 160 acres (half) of Discovery Island, and in his will gave his share of the island to the province of British Columbia. Beaumont was an avid seaman and even in his 80s would regularly row his boat from Discovery Island to Ten Mile Point, where he would go for walks in the woods. Evidence of the Beaumonts' beautiful home and gardens overlooking Rudlin Bay can still be seen. The home was designed on a nautical motif by the noted architect Francis Rattenbury.\n\nDiscovery Island Marine Provincial Park is open year round. There is a camping fee and services provided from May 1 - September 30. During the off-season, there is no fee and no services. There are gravel beaches and a few walking and hiking trails along the shores and through fir and arbutus woodlands. The trail system runs from the lighthouse on Sea Bird Point to Commodore Point and across to the western shore of the park. Hikers can ascend the 38-metre (125&nbsp;foot) Pandora Hill for improved views of the area and spectacular sweeping views of the [[Olympic Mountains]].\n\nIn May 2012 a lone wolf took up residence on Discovery Island. The park was closed and attempts to trap the wolf were made, but these were unsuccessful, and it was decided to reopen the park. The wolf has so far proven safe to humans, and as of March 2019 still inhabited the [https://www.oakbaynews.com/news/discovery-island-wolf-continues-to-thrive/ island].
