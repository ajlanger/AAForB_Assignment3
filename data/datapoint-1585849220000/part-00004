The Hecklers were founded 2 July 2011 as the Canberra Knights Hecklers but once the [[Canberra Knights|Knights]] folded the Hecklers switched to the Brave. The group is known for being very vocal at Brave home games with relentless heckling of the visiting team to make their trip to the capital a tough experience. The group use the social media platform [[Facebook]] to share experiences and keep in touch between matches. The Bravehearts were formed at the same time as the new team and members paint their faces and wear a tartan sash.

This rivalry intensified at the end of the [[2015 AIHL season]] when the Northstars came from behind to beat the CBR Brave in the Goodall Cup semi-finals. The Brave scored two shorthanded goals on the way to securing a 3\u20130 lead deep into the second period of the match before League MVP and AIHL record breaker, Geordie Wudrick, came to life and scored a third period hat trick that set up the Northstars comeback win as they scored a fourth and final goal to win the match 4\u20133. The Brave were devastated at missing out on the chance to contest the Goodall Cup final for the second year straight and just before the start of the 2016 AIHL season the club announced the signing of the very player that knocked them out the year before, naming Geordie Wudrick as one of the Brave's six import signings for 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/aihl-canberra-brave-snare-sharpshooter-geordie-wudrick-from-defending-champs-20160422-gocgq6.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave snare sharpshooter Geordie Wudrick from defending champs | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Jon | last=Tuxworth | date=2016-04-22 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}</ref>[[File:CBR_Brave_fan-made_fake_classifieds_poster,_May_2016.png|thumb|right|Fan made poster]][[File:CBR_Brave_Welcome_to_the_Middle_of_Nowhere_Placard,_May_2016.png|thumb|left|Middle of nowhere placard given out pre-game on 28 May 2016 for the CBR Brave vs Newcastle North Stars AIHL match]] It is very rare in the AIHL to see players switch teams so the move of Wudrick from Newcastle to Canberra made headlines.

Webster body slammed Wudrick from behind, knocking him out cold and hospitalising the Brave player. Wudrick missed a large amount of the 2016 AIHL season as a result. The inaction by the match referees incensed the CBR Brave team and fans and this carried through to the return double header weekend in Canberra in August. Brave DJ set the tone for the encounters with a rendition of [[The Imperial March|The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)]] from [[Star Wars]] when the Melbourne Ice players walked out onto the ice. A total of 252 penalty minutes were handed out during the two matches which also saw 6 players ejected, 5 players suspended, 4 separate fights and an all-out on ice melee between all the players. In amongst all the carnage there was nineteen goals scored in the first game and a further seven scored in the second game with two hard fought one goal victories being split between the two teams. The Ice secured a 10\u20139 victory in the first match after leading 7-2 before a third period rally by the Brave saw them score six unanswered goals to temporarily take the lead 8-7 before succumbing to the visitors late on.

The purpose of the foundation is to raise awareness and assist people in need who are struggling with mental health issues, particularly PTSD and depression in young men. The Foundation was born out of terrible circumstance when the brother-in-law, Robbie, of former Brave captain Mark Rummukainen sadly took his own life after suffering from depression. Robbie was well known to the Brave management and players with the loss felt by the whole Brave community. Since inception, the foundation has raised money through a number of events including dinners with players and auctioning off match-worn hockey gear. The Brave Foundation spends the money raised on tangible achievements as opposed to handing money over to a charity and not knowing where it ends up. For example, putting people through a program called \u2018Accidental Councillor\u2019 or funding of additional telephones for Lifeline. The Foundation has formed strong connections with a number of reputable charities and services such as [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]], [[beyondblue]] and [[Soldier On (charity)|Soldier On]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletter.cfm?page=95298&clientID=6061&leagueID=25105 | title = The BRAVE Foundation | publisher=www.theaihl.com | first=Georgia | last=Briggs | date=2016-05-24 | accessdate = 2017-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Ownership===\n\nIn 2014, the ACT community banded together to raise funds to keep AIHL hockey in Canberra following the demise of the [[Canberra Knights|Knights]].

CBR set then league records for most points (72 points) and most wins (24 wins) in a regular AIHL season. The Brave won the finals weekend in Melbourne, defeating the [[Melbourne Mustangs]] 5\u20131 in semi final 1 before defeating the [[Sydney Bears]] 4\u20133 in overtime in the Goodall Cup final. Trevor Gerling was named finals MVP and finished the regular season equal top point scorer (67 points) with [[Perth Thunder|Thunder]] player Pier-Olivier Grandmaison. The Cup victory provided Joey Hughes with his sixth Goodall Cup success, breaking the league record for a single player. It was the first time a Canberra franchise had won the AIHL championship and secured the Goodall Cup. While it was only the second time a team from the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] had claimed the Goodall Cup. An ACT representative team, which also included Dave Lewis and Mark Rummukainen, won the cup in 1998 in the old inter-state tournament format.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:800px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1f3d;\" colspan=\"4\"| <span style=\"color:#FFFF00;\">2018 Championship Roster</span>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd; width:90px;\"| Goaltenders\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#29'''</small> Tynan Theobald || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#31'''</small> Jakob Doornbos || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#35'''</small> Alexandre Tetreault || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#92'''</small> Mat Hewitt\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Defencemen\n|-\n| {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#4'''</small> Channing Bresciani || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#7'''</small> Bayley Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#12'''</small> Mark Rummukainen || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#17'''</small> James Byers\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#25'''</small> Matt Buskas || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#26'''</small> Darcy Flanagan || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#59'''</small> Per Daniel G\u00f6ransson || {{flagicon|NZL}} <small>'''#81'''</small> Matthew Harvey <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)|C]])'''</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Forwards\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#3'''</small> Mitchell Henning || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#6'''</small> Christopher McPhail || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#9'''</small> Wehebe Darge <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small> || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#11'''</small> David Lewis \n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#14'''</small> Jayden Lewis || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#15'''</small> Casey Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#16'''</small> Tyler Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#19'''</small> Jordan Gavin <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#20'''</small> Hayden Dawes || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#24'''</small> Joseph Hughes || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#48'''</small> Chris Leveille || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#64'''</small> Kai Miettinen <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|- style=\"border:0px;\"\n| {{flagicon|LAT}} <small>'''#66'''</small> Ainars Podzins || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#71'''</small> Jordan Brunt || {{flagicon|USA}} <small>'''#78'''</small> Trevor Gerling || \n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Coaching staff\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Robert Starke <small>'''([[Head coach]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Mike Sargeant <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|CAN}} Gordon Cocknell <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}}\n|}\n\n'''<big>2019 Premiership roster</big>'''\n\nThe 2019 Brave team broke AIHL regular season records for most wins (26), most points (79), largest winning streak (17 matches), most goals scored (161), least goals conceded in a 28 match season (67) and least losses in a 28 match season (2).

The report highlighted the issues of having an old private facility at the end of its lifespan servicing a growing ice sports community and national sports franchise in the national capital. The report suggested a full business case and plan be drawn up at exploring alternative options for building a new multi-purpose facility in the fastest growing areas of Canberra, the [[Molonglo Valley]] and [[Gungahlin]], where the lower land values can boost a feasibility case for construction compared to re-building in Phillip.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sport.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/811331/ACT-Indoor-Facilities-Combined-Document.pdf | title = Full Report: ACT Indoor Sports Facilities Study | publisher=ACT Government - Sport and Recreation Services | first= | last= | date=December 2015 | accessdate = 2016-04-21 }}</ref> Shane Rattenbury responded to the release of the report by saying a new ice sports facility with duel rinks for competition and practice was in the Government's longer-term plans but stressed the need for community engagement and private sector support.

This rivalry intensified at the end of the [[2015 AIHL season]] when the Northstars came from behind to beat the CBR Brave in the Goodall Cup semi-finals. The Brave scored two shorthanded goals on the way to securing a 3-0 lead deep into the second period of the match before League MVP and AIHL record breaker, Geordie Wudrick, came to life and scored a third period hat trick that set up the Northstars comeback win as they scored a fourth and final goal to win the match 4-3. The Brave were devastated at missing out on the chance to contest the Goodall Cup final for the second year straight and just before the start of the 2016 AIHL season the club announced the signing of the very player that knocked them out the year before, naming Geordie Wudrick as one of the Brave's six import signings for 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/aihl-canberra-brave-snare-sharpshooter-geordie-wudrick-from-defending-champs-20160422-gocgq6.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave snare sharpshooter Geordie Wudrick from defending champs | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Jon | last=Tuxworth | date=2016-04-22 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}</ref>[[File:CBR_Brave_fan-made_fake_classifieds_poster,_May_2016.png|thumb|right|Fan made poster]][[File:CBR_Brave_Welcome_to_the_Middle_of_Nowhere_Placard,_May_2016.png|thumb|left|Middle of nowhere placard given out pre-game on 28 May 2016 for the CBR Brave vs Newcastle North Stars AIHL match]] It is very rare in the AIHL to see players switch teams so the move of Wudrick from Newcastle to Canberra made headlines.

Webster body slammed Wudrick from behind, knocking him out cold and hospitalising the Brave player. Wudrick missed a large amount of the 2016 AIHL season as a result. The inaction by the match referees incensed the CBR Brave team and fans and this carried through to the return double header weekend in Canberra in August. Brave DJ set the tone for the encounters with a rendition of [[The Imperial March|The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)]] from [[Star Wars]] when the Melbourne Ice players walked out onto the ice. A total of 252 penalty minutes were handed out during the two matches which also saw 6 players ejected, 5 players suspended, 4 separate fights and an all-out on ice melee between all the players. In amongst all the carnage there was nineteen goals scored in the first game and a further seven scored in the second game with two hard fought one goal victories being split between the two teams. The Ice secured a 10-9 victory in the first match after leading 7-2 before a third period rally by the Brave saw them score six unanswered goals to temporarily take the lead 8-7 before succumbing to the visitors late on. While the Brave won the second match 4-3 to inflict only the second regulation time loss of the 2016 season on the Melbourne Ice.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientid=6061&leagueid=25105&gameid=1547440 | title = CBR Brave vs Melbourne Ice \u2013 06 August 2016 | publisher= www.theaihl.com | first= | last= | date=2016-08-06 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientID=6061&leagueID=25105&gameID=1547442 | title = CBR Brave vs Melbourne Ice \u2013 07 August 2016 | publisher= www.theaihl.com | first= | last= | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/cbr-brave-hockey-gladiators-get-skates-on-as-national-ice-finals-loom-20160801-gqi0vs.html | title = CBR Brave hockey gladiators get skates on as national ice finals loom | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Ian | last=Warden | date=2016-08-08 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/ice-hockey-cbr-brave-vs-melbourne-ice-20160807-gqmv78.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave coach Josh Unice says 'nobody wants to play us in the finals' | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Caden | last=Helmers | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe two teams met again in the semi-finals of the [[2016 AIHL season#Goodall Cup playoffs|AIHL Finals weekend]] as 1st (Ice) versus 4th (Brave).

The purpose of the foundation is to raise awareness and assist people in need who are struggling with mental health issues, particularly PTSD and depression in young men. The Foundation was born out of terrible circumstance when the brother-in-law, Robbie, of former Brave captain Mark Rummukainen sadly took his own life after suffering from depression. Robbie was well known to the Brave management and players with the loss felt by the whole Brave community. Since inception, the foundation has raised money through a number of events including dinners with players and auctioning off match-worn hockey gear. The Brave Foundation spends the money raised on tangible achievements as opposed to handing money over to a charity and not knowing where it ends up. For example, putting people through a program called \u2018Accidental Councillor\u2019 or funding of additional telephones for Lifeline. The Foundation has formed strong connections with a number of reputable charities and services such as [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]], [[beyondblue]] and [[Soldier On (charity)|Soldier On]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletter.cfm?page=95298&clientID=6061&leagueID=25105 | title = The BRAVE Foundation | publisher=www.theaihl.com | first=Georgia | last=Briggs | date=2016-05-24 | accessdate = 2017-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Ownership===\n\nIn 2014, the ACT community banded together to raise funds to keep AIHL hockey in Canberra following the demise of the [[Canberra Knights|Knights]].

CBR set then league records for most points (72 points) and most wins (24 wins) in a regular AIHL season. The Brave won the finals weekend in Melbourne, defeating the [[Melbourne Mustangs]] 5-1 in semi final 1 before defeating the [[Sydney Bears]] 4-3 in overtime in the Goodall Cup final. Trevor Gerling was named finals MVP and finished the regular season equal top point scorer (67 points) with [[Perth Thunder|Thunder]] player Pier-Olivier Grandmaison. The Cup victory provided Joey Hughes with his sixth Goodall Cup success, breaking the league record for a single player. It was the first time a Canberra franchise had won the AIHL championship and secured the Goodall Cup. While it was only the second time a team from the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] had claimed the Goodall Cup. An ACT representative team, which also included Dave Lewis and Mark Rummukainen, won the cup in 1998 in the old inter-state tournament format.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:800px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1f3d;\" colspan=\"4\"| <span style=\"color:#FFFF00;\">2018 Championship Roster</span>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd; width:90px;\"| Goaltenders\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#29'''</small> Tynan Theobald || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#31'''</small> Jakob Doornbos || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#35'''</small> Alexandre Tetreault || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#92'''</small> Mat Hewitt\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Defencemen\n|-\n| {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#4'''</small> Channing Bresciani || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#7'''</small> Bayley Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#12'''</small> Mark Rummukainen || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#17'''</small> James Byers\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#25'''</small> Matt Buskas || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#26'''</small> Darcy Flanagan || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#59'''</small> Per Daniel G\u00f6ransson || {{flagicon|NZL}} <small>'''#81'''</small> Matthew Harvey <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)|C]])'''</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Forwards\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#3'''</small> Mitchell Henning || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#6'''</small> Christopher McPhail || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#9'''</small> Wehebe Darge <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small> || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#11'''</small> David Lewis \n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#14'''</small> Jayden Lewis || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#15'''</small> Casey Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#16'''</small> Tyler Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#19'''</small> Jordan Gavin <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#20'''</small> Hayden Dawes || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#24'''</small> Joseph Hughes || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#48'''</small> Chris Leveille || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#64'''</small> Kai Miettinen <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|- style=\"border:0px;\"\n| {{flagicon|LAT}} <small>'''#66'''</small> Ainars Podzins || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#71'''</small> Jordan Brunt || {{flagicon|USA}} <small>'''#78'''</small> Trevor Gerling || \n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Coaching staff\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Robert Starke <small>'''([[Head coach]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Mike Sargeant <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|CAN}} Gordon Cocknell <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}}\n|}\n\n'''<big>2019 Premiership roster</big>'''\n\nThe 2019 Brave team broke AIHL regular season records for most wins (26), most points (79), largest winning streak (17 matches), most goals scored (161), least goals conceded in a 28 match season (67) and least losses in a 28 match season (2).
