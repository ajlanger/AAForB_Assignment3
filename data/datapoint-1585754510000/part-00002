The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series.

The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/illustration-tom-hovey |title=Illustration: We interview the artist behind the Great British Bake Off, Tom Hovey|author= Liv Siddall |date=1 November 2013 |work=It's Nice That }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomhovey.co.uk/the-great-british-bake-off/ |title=Tom Hovey }}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver;\"|Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\"  |Average UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10379873/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-moves-to-BBC1.html |title=The Great British Bake Off moves to BBC1 |author=Rachel Moss|date= 15 October 2013|work=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref name=\"broadcast\">{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/bbc1-rises-to-the-challenge/5082034.article |title=BBC1 rises to the challenge|date=22 January 2015 |author= Stephen Price |work=Broadcast }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeslot\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 17 August 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 21 September 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Edd Kimber]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miranda Gore Browne\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2.77\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Tuesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"8\"| [[BBC Two]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruth Clemens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|2]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 4 October 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Joanne Wheatley]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Holly Bell\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 4.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mary-Anne Boermans\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)|3]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 16 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[John Whaite]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brendan Lynch\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 5.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[James Morton (baker)|James Morton]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 20 August 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 22 October 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Frances Quinn]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kimberley Wilson\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 7.35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Ruby Tandoh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 6 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 8 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nancy Birtwhistle]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis Troyano\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.04\n| rowspan=\"6\" | Wednesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"6\" | [[BBC One]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Burr\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 5 August 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 7 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nadiya Hussain]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Cumming\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Tamal Ray]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 7)|7]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 24 August 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 26 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Candice Brown]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Andrew M.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

[[Love Productions]], in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds, attempting to impress a group of judges with their baking skills, with a contestant being eliminated in each round, with the winner being selected from the contestants who reach the finals. The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series. After its seventh series, [[Love Productions]] signed a three-year deal with [[Channel 4]] to produce the series for the broadcaster.<ref name=\"Bake Off Move 2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off/|title=BBC loses Great British Bake Off, as Channel 4 swoops for corporation's biggest show|last=Foster|first=Patrick|date=12 September 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> However, [[BBC Studios]] still owns the global distribution rights to the show, which are set for renewal in 2028.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a807901/bbc-worldwide-still-has-the-international-rights-to-great-british-bake-off-so-there/|title=BBC Worldwide still has the global Bake Off rights|last=Nissim|first=Mayer|date=2016-09-14|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally presented by [[Sue Perkins]] and [[Mel Giedroyc]], with judges [[Mary Berry]] and [[Paul Hollywood]].

The applicants to the show are assessed by a researcher, followed by an audition in London with two of their bakes. They then undergo a screen test and an interview with a producer. A second audition involves the applicants baking two recipes for the judges in front of the cameras.<ref name=\"telegraph 2012\" /> Ten contestants were chosen for the first series, twelve for the following two series, thirteen for the fourth and tenth,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/20/meet-the-2019-great-british-bake-off-contestants-from-the-teacher-to-the-terminator |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2019}}</ref> and twelve from series five to series nine.\n\nIn each episode, the amateur bakers are given three challenges based on that week's theme: a signature bake, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper.<ref name=\"telegraph 2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9411189/Behind-the-scenes-at-the-Great-British-Bake-Off.html |title=Behind the scenes at the Great British Bake-Off |author=Sarah Stephens |date= 14 August 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref> The three challenges take place over two days, and the filming takes up to 16 hours a day. The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/illustration-tom-hovey |title=Illustration: We interview the artist behind the Great British Bake Off, Tom Hovey|author= Liv Siddall |date=1 November 2013 |work=It's Nice That }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomhovey.co.uk/the-great-british-bake-off/ |title=Tom Hovey }}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver;\"|Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\"  |Average UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10379873/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-moves-to-BBC1.html |title=The Great British Bake Off moves to BBC1 |author=Rachel Moss|date= 15 October 2013|work=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref name=\"broadcast\">{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/bbc1-rises-to-the-challenge/5082034.article |title=BBC1 rises to the challenge|date=22 January 2015 |author= Stephen Price |work=Broadcast }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeslot\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 17 August 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 21 September 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Edd Kimber]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miranda Gore Browne\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2.77\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Tuesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"8\"| [[BBC Two]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruth Clemens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|2]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 4 October 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Joanne Wheatley]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Holly Bell\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 4.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mary-Anne Boermans\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)|3]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 16 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[John Whaite]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brendan Lynch\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 5.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[James Morton (baker)|James Morton]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 20 August 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 22 October 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Frances Quinn]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kimberley Wilson\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 7.35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Ruby Tandoh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 6 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 8 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nancy Birtwhistle]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis Troyano\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.04\n| rowspan=\"6\" | Wednesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"6\" | [[BBC One]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Burr\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 5 August 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 7 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nadiya Hussain]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Cumming\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Tamal Ray]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 7)|7]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 24 August 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 26 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Candice Brown]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Andrew M.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.
