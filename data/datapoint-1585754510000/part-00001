In the 19th century [[Wales|Welsh]] workers settled in the area to work in nearby collieries. A Welsh-speaking [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-conformist]] chapel ([[Calvinistic Methodists]]) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby [[Cronton#Cronton Colliery|Cronton Colliery]] finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)]]. Both Huyton and Roby have stations on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (another station, [[Huyton Quarry railway station|Huyton Quarry]], closed in 1958). The railway's construction was supervised by [[George Stephenson]] and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world's first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway's official opening, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] alighted the train at [[Roby railway station|Roby station]].<ref>{{cite book |title= 'Huyton & Roby: A History of Two Townships'|last= King|first= Alan|year= 1984|publisher= Metro. Borough of Knowsley|location= Knowsley|isbn= 0-947739-01-7|page= 45}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the [[Luftwaffe]] but the scale of destruction was much less than that experienced by Liverpool, [[Bootle]] and [[Birkenhead]]. Schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton, instead schools and homes were provided with [[air-raid shelter]]s.\n\nHuyton was also host to three wartime camps: an [[internment camp]], a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] and a base for American servicemen.\n\nThe internment camp appeared to have been one of the biggest in the country. Some internees were refugees from the [[Nazi]]s, including [[socialist]]s such as [[Kurt Hager]] and a large number of artists attacked for their \"degeneracy.\" Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer [[Kurt Jooss]], musicians, sociologist [[Norbert Elias]], anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and composer [[Hans G\u00e1l]]. More than 40 per cent of Huyton's internees were over 50 years old.\n\nThe camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with [[barbed wire]] fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents. Initially the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the [[Isle of Man]]. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship the ''[[Arandora Star]]'', with the loss of nearly 700 lives, the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the \"Bluebell Estate\" and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe prisoner of war camp closed in 1948. Some inmates \"went native\", stayed in Britain and married local women. Among those in the Huyton camp was [[Bert Trautmann]], who later went on to be the 1950s [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Manchester City]]. From 1944, American servicemen were temporarily stationed in Huyton.\n\n===Murders===\nHuyton was brought to national attention in 2005 after the racially motivated murder of black teenager [[murder of Anthony Walker|Anthony Walker]] in McGoldrick Park.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4732563.stm|title=Man held over student axe murder|work=BBC News|date=31 July 2005|accessdate=1 February 2008}}</ref> Two white local youths were later found guilty of his murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

These Liverpool [[overspill estate|\u2018overspill' housing estates]] were Fincham, Huyton Farm, Longview and Woolfall Heath. Other smaller developments were commissioned by the [[urban district council]] or privately commissioned. By 1950 the population was over 55,000, the vast majority of whom had moved to the area from the city of Liverpool.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the district successfully fought off absorption into the Liverpool City Council boundaries.

It was formed from [[Liverpool City RLFC|Liverpool Stanley]] (1934\u20131951) and [[Liverpool City RLFC|Liverpool City]] (1951\u20131968). [[Huyton RLFC]] struggled in the second division of the [[Rugby Football League]] until 1985, when they were replaced by [[Runcorn Highfield RLFC|Runcorn Highfield]]. This club, later renamed [[Highfield RLFC|Highfield]], struggled on near the bottom of the pro game: in 1995\u20131996 they gained just one point all season and changed their name to [[Liverpool Stanley#Prescot Panthers \u2013 1996\u201397|Prescot Panthers]], before folding at the end of the 1997 season. (Huytonians still interested in supporting pro rugby league have the choice of either [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] or [[Widnes Vikings]], both of whom are {{convert|6|mi|km}} away from Huyton).\n\nIn football, the town has produced two outstanding midfield England internationals: [[Peter Reid]] ([[Everton F.C.|Everton]]) and [[Steven Gerrard]] ([[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]). Other footballers include [[Joey Barton]], [[Craig Hignett]], [[Tony Hibbert]], [[David Nugent]], [[Lee Molyneux]], [[Leon Osman]], [[John Relish]], [[Greg Tansey]], [[Lee Trundle]] and [[Callum McManaman]]. Notably on 28 March 2007, two of Huyton's most prominent footballers starred for England in a 3\u20130 away win in [[Andorra]]. Goals came from Steven Gerrard (2) and David Nugent in a proud night for Huyton. Both players were educated at Cardinal Heenan High School, who have a track record as one of the country's top schools for sport.\n\nHuyton has many amateur football teams at both junior and senior level, but only one FA Charter Standard Club, Paramount Community Football Club.\n\nDespite producing so many pro footballers, Huyton has never been able to sustain a semi-pro club for long. Nearby Kirkby Town changed their name to [[Knowsley United Football Club|Knowsley United]] in 1988 and moved to [[Alt Park]], the former home of Huyton [[Rugby league]] Club. In United's first five seasons they were successful. In 1988\u201389 they finished runners-up in the [[North West Counties Football League]]. The following season they were champions and won promotion to the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One. They were accordingly promoted to the Premier Division. The following season they reached the first round proper of the [[FA Cup]], only to be beaten by [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] at home. The momentum did not last and Knowsley United ceased to be a senior semi-pro side in 1998.\n\nHuytonians wishing to support a local semi-pro outfit have [[Prescot Cables F.C.|Prescot Cables]] located at [[Valerie Park]] in the Northern Premier League (Premier Division) less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} away.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also|List of people from Merseyside}}\nHuyton-with-Roby has several [[Beatles]] connections.

In the 19th century [[Wales|Welsh]] workers settled in the area to work in nearby collieries. A Welsh-speaking [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-conformist]] chapel ([[Calvinistic Methodists]]) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby [[Cronton#Cronton Colliery|Cronton Colliery]] finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)]]. Both Huyton and Roby have stations on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (another station, [[Huyton Quarry railway station|Huyton Quarry]], closed in 1958). The railway's construction was supervised by [[George Stephenson]] and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world's first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway's official opening, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] alighted the train at [[Roby railway station|Roby station]].<ref>{{cite book |title= 'Huyton & Roby: A History of Two Townships'|last= King|first= Alan|year= 1984|publisher= Metro. Borough of Knowsley|location= Knowsley|isbn= 0-947739-01-7|page= 45}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the [[Luftwaffe]] but the scale of destruction was much less than that experienced by Liverpool, [[Bootle]] and [[Birkenhead]]. Schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton, instead schools and homes were provided with [[air-raid shelter]]s.\n\nHuyton was also host to three wartime camps: an [[internment camp]], a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] and a base for American servicemen.\n\nThe internment camp appeared to have been one of the biggest in the country. Some internees were refugees from the [[Nazi]]s, including [[socialist]]s such as [[Kurt Hager]] and a large number of artists attacked for their \"degeneracy.\" Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer [[Kurt Jooss]], musicians, sociologist [[Norbert Elias]], anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and composer [[Hans G\u00e1l]]. More than 40 per cent of Huyton's internees were over 50 years old.\n\nThe camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with [[barbed wire]] fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents. Initially the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the [[Isle of Man]]. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship the ''[[Arandora Star]]'', with the loss of nearly 700 lives, the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the \"Bluebell Estate\" and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe prisoner of war camp closed in 1948. Some inmates \"went native\", stayed in Britain and married local women. Among those in the Huyton camp was [[Bert Trautmann]], who later went on to be the 1950s [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Manchester City]]. From 1944, American servicemen were temporarily stationed in Huyton.\n\n===Murders===\nHuyton was brought to national attention in 2005 after the racially motivated murder of black teenager [[murder of Anthony Walker|Anthony Walker]] in McGoldrick Park.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4732563.stm|title=Man held over student axe murder|work=BBC News|date=31 July 2005|accessdate=1 February 2008}}</ref> Two white local youths were later found guilty of his murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

These Liverpool [[overspill estate|\u2018overspill' housing estates]] were Fincham, Huyton Farm, Longview and Woolfall Heath. Other smaller developments were commissioned by the [[urban district council]] or privately commissioned. By 1950 the population was over 55,000, the vast majority of whom had moved to the area from the city of Liverpool.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the district successfully fought off absorption into the Liverpool City Council boundaries.

It was formed from [[Liverpool City RLFC|Liverpool Stanley]] (1934\u20131951) and [[Liverpool City RLFC|Liverpool City]] (1951\u20131968). [[Huyton RLFC]] struggled in the second division of the [[Rugby Football League]] until 1985, when they were replaced by [[Runcorn Highfield RLFC|Runcorn Highfield]]. This club, later renamed [[Highfield RLFC|Highfield]], struggled on near the bottom of the pro game: in 1995\u20131996 they gained just one point all season and changed their name to [[Liverpool Stanley#Prescot Panthers \u2013 1996\u201397|Prescot Panthers]], before folding at the end of the 1997 season. (Huytonians still interested in supporting pro rugby league have the choice of either [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] or [[Widnes Vikings]], both of whom are {{convert|6|mi|km}} away from Huyton).\n\nIn football, the town has produced two outstanding midfield England internationals: [[Peter Reid]] ([[Everton F.C.|Everton]]) and [[Steven Gerrard]] ([[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]). Other footballers include [[Joey Barton]], [[Craig Hignett]], [[Tony Hibbert]], [[David Nugent]], [[Lee Molyneux]], [[Leon Osman]], [[John Relish]], [[Greg Tansey]], [[Lee Trundle]] and [[Callum McManaman]]. Notably on 28 March 2007, two of Huyton's most prominent footballers starred for England in a 3-0 away win in [[Andorra]]. Goals came from Steven Gerrard (2) and David Nugent in a proud night for Huyton. Both players were educated at Cardinal Heenan High School, who have a track record as one of the country's top schools for sport.\n\nHuyton has many amateur football teams at both junior and senior level, but only one FA Charter Standard Club, Paramount Community Football Club.\n\nDespite producing so many pro footballers, Huyton has never been able to sustain a semi-pro club for long. Nearby Kirkby Town changed their name to [[Knowsley United Football Club|Knowsley United]] in 1988 and moved to [[Alt Park]], the former home of Huyton [[Rugby league]] Club. In United's first five seasons they were successful. In 1988\u201389 they finished runners-up in the [[North West Counties Football League]]. The following season they were champions and won promotion to the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One. They were accordingly promoted to the Premier Division. The following season they reached the first round proper of the [[FA Cup]], only to be beaten by [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] at home. The momentum did not last and Knowsley United ceased to be a senior semi-pro side in 1998.\n\nHuytonians wishing to support a local semi-pro outfit have [[Prescot Cables F.C.|Prescot Cables]] located at [[Valerie Park]] in the Northern Premier League (Premier Division) less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} away.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also|List of people from Merseyside}}\nHuyton-with-Roby has several [[Beatles]] connections.
