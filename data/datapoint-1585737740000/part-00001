The others would still be learning.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A tree for poverty: Somali poetry and prose|last=Laurance|first=Margaret|publisher=McMaster University Library Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll of these traditions, including [[festival]]s, [[Istunka|martial arts]], dress, literature, sport and games such as [[Shax (board game)|Shax]], have immensely contributed to the enrichment of Somali heritage.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Somalia}}\nSomalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali [[folklore]]. Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. That is, they only use five [[pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale, such as the [[major scale]]. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, [[Sudan]] or [[Arabia]], but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between [[lyricist]]s (''midho''), songwriters (''laxan'') and singers (''Codka'' or \"voice\").<ref>Diriye, pp.170-171</ref>\n\n====Musicians and bands====\n[[File:Saadoaliw1.jpg|thumb|right|Somali singer [[Saado Ali Warsame]].]]\n<!-- citations in link-thrus are sufficient for embedded lists per [[MOS:EMBED]] -->\n*[[Aar Maanta]] \u2013 UK-based Somali singer, composer, writer and music producer.\n*[[Abdi Sinimo]] \u2013 prominent Somali artist and inventor of the [[Balwo]] musical style.\n*[[Abdullahi Qarshe]] \u2013 Somali musician, poet and playwright known for his innovative styles of music, which included a wide variety of musical instruments such as the guitar, piano and [[oud]].\n*[[Ali Feiruz]] \u2013 Somali musician from Djibouti; part of the Radio [[Hargeisa]] generation of Somali artists.\n*[[Dur-Dur]] \u2013 Somali band active during the 1980s and 1990s in Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia.\n*[[Hasan Adan Samatar]] \u2013 popular male artist during the 1970s and 80s.\n*[[Jonis Bashir]] \u2013 Somali-Italian actor and singer\n*[[Khadija Qalanjo]] \u2013 popular Somali singer in the 1970s and 1980s.\n*[[K'naan]] \u2013 award-winning Somali-Canadian hip hop artist.\n*[[Magool]] (2 May 1948 \u2013 19 March 2004) \u2013 prominent Somali singer considered in [[Somalia]] as one of the greatest entertainers of all time.\n*[[Maryam Mursal]] (born 1950) \u2013 Somali musician, composer and vocalist whose work has been produced by the record label [[Real World Records|Real World]].\n*[[Mohamed Mooge Liibaan|Mohammed Mooge]] \u2013 Somali artist from the Radio Hargeisa generation.\n*[[Poly Styrene]] \u2013 Somali-British punk rock singer; best known as being the lead singer of [[X Ray Spex]].\n*[[Saado Ali Warsame]] \u2013 Somali singer-songwriter and modern qaraami exponent.\n*[[Waaberi]] \u2013 Somalia's foremost musical group that toured through several countries in Northeast Africa and Asia, including [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]] and [[China]].\n*[[Waayaha Cusub]] \u2013 Somali music collective.

Following the creation of the [[Somali Film Agency]] (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. [[Hassan Sheikh Mumin]] was considered one of the most prolific and early playwrights and composers in Somali literature. Mumin's most important work is ''Shabeel Naagood'' (1965), a piece that touches on the social position of women, urbanization, changing traditional practices, and the importance of education during the early pre-independence period. Although the issues it describes were later to some degree redressed, the work remains a mainstay of Somali literature.<ref name=\"Aaasc\">{{cite journal|last=African Studies Center|first=University of California|journal=African Arts|year=1973|volume=7-8|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smBUAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 June 2012|title=African Arts}}</ref>  ''Shabeel Naagood'' was translated into English in 1974 under the title ''Leopard Among the Women'' by the [[Somali Studies]] pioneer [[Bogumi\u0142 W. Andrzejewski]], who also wrote the introduction. Mumin composed both the play itself and the music used in it.<ref name=\"Haywardlewis\"/> The piece is regularly featured in various school curricula, including [[Oxford University]], which first published the English translation under its [[Oxford University Press|press house]].\n\nDuring one decisive passage in the play, the heroine, Shallaayo, laments that she has been tricked into a false marriage by the Leopard in the title:\n<center>\n{{Quotation|\"Women have no share in the encampments of this world\n\nAnd it is men who made these laws, to their own advantage.\n\nBy God, by God, men are our enemies, though we ourselves nurtured them\n\nWe suckled them at our breasts, and they maimed us:\n\nWe do not share peace with them.\"}}\n</center>\n\nThe Somali filmmaker [[Ali Said Hassan]] concurrently served as the SFA's representative in Rome. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as ''riwaayado'' were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry.\n\nEpic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of [[video]] technology and national television networks. [[Said Salah Ahmed]] during this period directed his first feature film, ''The Somali Darwish'' (''The Somalia Dervishes''), devoted to the Dervish movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as [[Somaliwood]], this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques. The young directors [[Abdisalam Aato]] of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are at the forefront of this quiet revolution.<ref name=\"Somaliwood\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2007/may/somaliwood_columbus_has_become_a_haven_for_somali_filmmaking.aspx|title=Somaliwood: Columbus Has Become A Haven for Somali Filmmaking|publisher=The Other Paper|date=19 April 2007|accessdate=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Somali art}}\n[[File:Ucidlhd29.png|thumb|left|A Somali woman with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] eyes.]]\nSomalis have old visual art traditions, which include pottery, jewelry and wood carving. In the medieval period, affluent urbanites commissioned local wood and marble carvers to work on their interiors and houses. Intricate patterns also adorn the [[mihrab]]s and [[Column|pillars]] of ancient Somali [[mosque]]s. Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women. Among the nomads, carving, especially [[woodwork]], was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as [[spoon]]s, [[comb]]s and [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]]. It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture have given way to workshops employing electrical machinery, which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313313332|pages=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri/page/97 97]|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri/page/97}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[henna]] is an important part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women on their hands, arms, feet and neck during wedding ceremonies, [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], [[Ramadan]] and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to those in the Arabian peninsula, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding takes place. Somali women have likewise traditionally applied [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] (''kuul'') to their eyes.<ref name=\"Loughran\">Katheryne S.

The cloth is usually made out of ''alandi'', which is a textile that is common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with other fabrics, including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the ''dirac''. It is a long, light, diaphanous [[voile]] dress made of [[silk]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[taffeta]] or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length [[Slip (clothing)|half-slip]] and a brassiere. Known as the ''gorgorad'', the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads.<ref name=\"Abdullahi117\"/>\n\nMarried women tend to wear [[Headscarf|headscarves]] referred to as ''shaash''.

Prior to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}}, {{harvnb|Semino et al.|2004}} East Africa as a possible place of origin of E-M78, based upon Ethiopian testing. This was because of the high frequency and diversity of E-M78 lineages in the region of Ethiopia. However, {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} were able to study more data, including populations from North Africa who were not represented in the {{harvnb|Semino|Magri|Benuzzi|Lin|2004}} study, and found evidence that the E-M78 lineages which make up a significant proportion of some populations in that region, were relatively young branches (see E-V32 below). They therefore concluded that \"Northeast Africa\" was the likely place of origin of E-M78 based on \"the peripheral geographic distribution of the most derived subhaplogroups with respect to northeastern Africa, as well as the results of quantitative analysis of UEP and microsatellite diversity\". So according to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} E-M35, the parent clade of E-M78, originated in East Africa, subsequently spread to Northeast Africa, and then there was a \"back migration\" of E-M215 chromosomes that had acquired the E-M78 mutation. {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} therefore note this as evidence for \"a corridor for bidirectional migrations\" between Northeast Africa (Egypt and Libya in their data) on the one hand and East Africa on the other.

Our initial results indicate a sharp cline in M1 frequencies that generally does not extend into sub-Saharan Africa. While our North and especially East African samples contained frequencies of M1 over 20%, our sub-Saharan samples consisted almost entirely of the L1 or L2 haplogroups only. In addition, there existed a significant amount of homogeneity within the M1 haplogroup. This sharp cline indicates a history of little admixture between these regions. This could imply a more recent ancestry for M1 in Africa, as older lineages are more diverse and widespread by nature, and may be an indication of a back-migration into Africa from the Middle East.\"<ref name=\"AD.\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Autosomal ancestry===\n[[File:Ethio-Somali component.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Genetic components present in select Cushitic populations]]\n[[File:Northeast_African_genomic_variation_ADMIXTURE_plot.PNG|thumb|upright=2.5|Genetic components present in select Cushitic/HOA populations]]\n[[File:Young Somali man2a.jpg|thumb|A young Somali man.]]\nAccording to an [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.<ref name=\"Hodgson2014\">{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jason A.|last2=Mulligan|first2=Connie J.|last3=Al-Meeri|first3=Ali|last4=Raaum|first4=Ryan L.|date=12 June 2014|title=Early Back-to-Africa Migration into the Horn of Africa|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e1004393|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4055572|pmid=24921250}}</ref> Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv|last=Lazaridis|first=Iosif|last2=Nadel|first2=Dani|last3=Rollefson|first3=Gary|last4=Merrett|first4=Deborah C.|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Fernandes|first7=Daniel|last8=Novak|first8=Mario|last9=Gamarra|first9=Beatriz|date=16 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world9s first farmers|biorxiv=059311}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hodgson et al.

The genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking populations in the Horn of Africa represents ancestries (Ethiopic and Ethio-Somali) not found outside of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations in any significance. Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al. states:\n<blockquote>\"The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population.

Following the creation of the [[Somali Film Agency]] (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. [[Hassan Sheikh Mumin]] was considered one of the most prolific and early playrighters and composers in Somali literature. Mumin's most important work is ''Shabeel Naagood'' (1965), a piece that touches on the social position of women, urbanization, changing traditional practices, and the importance of education during the early pre-independence period. Although the issues it describes were later to some degree redressed, the work remains a mainstay of Somali literature.<ref name=\"Aaasc\">{{cite journal|last=African Studies Center|first=University of California|journal=African Arts|year=1973|volume=7-8|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smBUAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 June 2012|title=African Arts}}</ref>  ''Shabeel Naagood'' was translated into English in 1974 under the title ''Leopard Among the Women'' by the [[Somali Studies]] pioneer [[Bogumi\u0142 W.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as ''riwaayado'' were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry.\n\nEpic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of [[video]] technology and national television networks. [[Said Salah Ahmed]] during this period directed his first feature film, ''The Somali Darwish'' (''The Somalia Dervishes''), devoted to the Dervish movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as [[Somaliwood]], this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques.

Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women.

It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''.

It is a long, light, diaphanous [[voile]] dress made of [[silk]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[taffeta]] or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length [[Slip (clothing)|half-slip]] and a brassiere. Known as the ''gorgorad'', the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit.

The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (''canjeero'' or ''canjeelo'') similar to Ethiopian [[injera]], but smaller and thinner, or ''muufo'' a Somali flat bread traditionally baked on a clay oven. These breads might also be eaten with a stew (''maraqe'') or soup at lunch or dinner.<ref>Abdullahi, pp.111-114.</ref> ''Qado'' or lunch is often elaborate, varieties of ''bariis'' ([[rice]]), the most popular being [[basmati]] are usually served as the main dish alongside goat, lamb or fish.

Prior to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}}, {{harvnb|Semino et al.|2004}} East Africa as a possible place of origin of E-M78, based upon Ethiopian testing. This was because of the high frequency and diversity of E-M78 lineages in the region of Ethiopia. However, {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} were able to study more data, including populations from North Africa who were not represented in the {{harvnb|Semino|Magri|Benuzzi|Lin|2004}} study, and found evidence that the E-M78 lineages which make up a significant proportion of some populations in that region, were relatively young branches (see E-V32 below). They therefore concluded that \"Northeast Africa\" was the likely place of origin of E-M78 based on \"the peripheral geographic distribution of the most derived subhaplogroups with respect to northeastern Africa, as well as the results of quantitative analysis of UEP and microsatellite diversity\". So according to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} E-M35, the parent clade of E-M78, originated in East Africa, subsequently spread to Northeast Africa, and then there was a \"back migration\" of E-M215 chromosomes that had acquired the E-M78 mutation. {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} therefore note this as evidence for \"a corridor for bidirectional migrations\" between Northeast Africa (Egypt and Libya in their data) on the one hand and East Africa on the other.

(2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.<ref name=\"Hodgson2014\">{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jason A.|last2=Mulligan|first2=Connie J.|last3=Al-Meeri|first3=Ali|last4=Raaum|first4=Ryan L.|date=12 June 2014|title=Early Back-to-Africa Migration into the Horn of Africa|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e1004393|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4055572|pmid=24921250}}</ref> Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv|last=Lazaridis|first=Iosif|last2=Nadel|first2=Dani|last3=Rollefson|first3=Gary|last4=Merrett|first4=Deborah C.|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Fernandes|first7=Daniel|last8=Novak|first8=Mario|last9=Gamarra|first9=Beatriz|date=16 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world9s first farmers|biorxiv=059311}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hodgson et al.

Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al. states:\n<blockquote>\"The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population.
