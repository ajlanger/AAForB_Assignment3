It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen (\"Wheat\") outside Bavaria. The terms '''Hefeweizen''' (\"yeast wheat\") or Hefewei\u00dfbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term '''Kristallweizen''' (crystal wheat), or kristall Wei\u00df (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is [[Filtered beer|filtered]] to remove the yeast and wheat proteins which contribute to its cloudy appearance.\n\nThe Hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 [[IBUs]]) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer's relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavor note unique to Hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is [[2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol|4-vinyl guaiacol]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Donaghy|first=John A.|author2=Paul F.

Among those used are:\n\n* Wei\u00dfbier, short Wei\u00dfe: \"Wei\u00df\" is [[Germany|German]] for \"white\". These terms are used almost exclusively in the southern German state of [[Bavaria]] and in [[Austria]].\n* Weizenbier, short Weizen: \"Weizen\" is German for \"wheat\". These terms are used in the western ([[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]) and northern German regions for Wei\u00dfbier. \n* Hefewei\u00dfbier or Hefeweizen: \"Hefe\" is the German word for yeast, added to indicate that the beer is [[bottle-conditioned]] (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment.\n* Kristallwei\u00dfbier or Kristallweizen: \"Kristall\" being German for crystal, added if Wei\u00dfbier is [[filtered beer|filtered]] clear of sediment.\n* Dunkles Wei\u00dfbier or Dunkelweizen: a dark version of a wheat beer (\"dunkel\" is the German word for \"dark\").\n* Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the [[bock]] [[beer style|style]] originating in Germany.\n* Witbier (Literally, \"white beer\") or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer.\n* Bi\u00e8re blanche (Literally, \"white beer\"): The French language name for wheat beer.\n\n==Serving==\nBavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in {{convert|500|ml|USoz|abbr=on}}, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 250ml glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Wei\u00dfe is often served in a [[schooner (glass)|schooner]].\n\nKristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there.<ref name = \"Warner\" /> The modern American custom appears to have originated in [[Portland, Oregon]] in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served [[Widmer Brothers Brewery]]'s Weizenbier with a slice of lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the [[Cascade hop]]s.<ref name=Tepedelen>{{cite web \n|title=Hefeweizen Facts And Fiction\n|url=http://imbibemagazine.com/hazed-and-confused-hefeweizen/ \n|author=Adem Tepedelen\n|date=18 January 2009\n|work=Imbibe}}</ref>\n\nIn northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam.<ref>[http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en Weizenbier or wheat beer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106215730/http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en |date=6 November 2007 }}</ref> A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is [[Shandy|cola-weizen]], which is a mix of cola and Weizenbier. Another mixture popular during the summer is a [[radler]] variant with a 50\u201350 mix of Wei\u00dfbier with lemonade called \"Russ\", which is the German term for Russian.\n\nWhen serving a bottled unfiltered wheat beer hold the glass on an angle and pour slowly. With about 10% or 15% left swirl smoothly to suspend the yeast, then add to improve the flavor, scent and appearance.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Sensory profile==\nWei\u00dfbiers feature fermentation by-products such as [[ester]]s (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially [[isoamyl acetate]], reminiscent of bananas, and the [[natural phenol|phenolic compound]] [[guaiacol]], a metabolite of [[ferulic acid]], which smells and tastes like [[clove]]s. Other phenolics sometimes found in Wei\u00dfbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Wei\u00dfbiers is close to 15 [[International Bitterness Units]], a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nThe ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe [[carbonation]] level can range from 5.5&nbsp;grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7&nbsp;grams per liter, or more.

These terms are used in the western ([[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]) and northern German regions for Wei\u00dfbier. \n* Hefewei\u00dfbier or Hefeweizen: \"Hefe\" is the German word for yeast, added to indicate that the beer is [[bottle-conditioned]] (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment.\n* Kristallwei\u00dfbier or Kristallweizen: \"Kristall\" being German for crystal, added if Wei\u00dfbier is [[filtered beer|filtered]] clear of sediment.\n* Dunkles Wei\u00dfbier or Dunkelweizen: a dark version of a wheat beer (\"dunkel\" is the German word for \"dark\").\n* Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the [[bock]] [[beer style|style]] originating in Germany.\n* Witbier (Literally, \"white beer\") or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer.\n* Bi\u00e8re blanche (Literally, \"white beer\"): The French language name for wheat beer.\n\n==Serving==\nBavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in {{convert|500|ml|USoz|abbr=on}}, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 250ml glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Wei\u00dfe is often served in a [[schooner (glass)|schooner]].\n\nKristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there.<ref name = \"Warner\" /> The modern American custom appears to have originated in [[Portland, Oregon]] in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served [[Widmer Brothers Brewery]]'s Weizenbier with a slice of lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the [[Cascade hop]]s.<ref name=Tepedelen>{{cite web \n|title=Hefeweizen Facts And Fiction\n|url=http://imbibemagazine.com/hazed-and-confused-hefeweizen/ \n|author=Adem Tepedelen\n|date=18 January 2009\n|work=Imbibe}}</ref>\n\nIn northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam.<ref>[http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en Weizenbier or wheat beer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106215730/http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en |date=6 November 2007 }}</ref> A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is [[Shandy|cola-weizen]], which is a mix of cola and Weizenbier. Another mixture popular during the summer is a [[radler]] variant with a 50\u201350 mix of Wei\u00dfbier with lemonade called \"Russ\", which is the German term for Russian.\n\nWhen serving a bottled unfiltered wheat beer hold the glass on an angle and pour slowly. With about 10% or 15% left swirl smoothly to suspend the yeast, then add to improve the flavor, scent and appearance.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Sensory profile==\nWei\u00dfbiers feature fermentation by-products such as [[ester]]s (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially [[isoamyl acetate]], reminiscent of bananas, and the [[natural phenol|phenolic compound]] [[guaiacol]], a metabolite of [[ferulic acid]], which smells and tastes like [[clove]]s. Other phenolics sometimes found in Wei\u00dfbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Wei\u00dfbiers is close to 15 [[International Bitterness Units]], a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nThe ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe [[carbonation]] level can range from 5.5&nbsp;grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7&nbsp;grams per liter, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially in light of the high protein content of wheat malt.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Beer glassware]]\n*[[Beer in Belgium]]\n*[[Beer in Germany]]\n*[[Rye beer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*''German Wheat Beer'', Eric Warner, Brewers Publications (1992), {{ISBN|0-937381-34-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Beers_from_Germany|German Beers}}\n* [http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style15.php  Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) wheat beer style guidelines]\n{{Beer Styles}}\n{{Brewers of wheat beer}}\n{{Wheat}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wheat Beer}}\n[[Category:Beer styles]]\n[[Category:Wheat-based drinks]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer"}
