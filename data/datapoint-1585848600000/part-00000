A co-production of the United States and Canada, the film stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Linus Roache]], [[Ned Dennehy]], [[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Richard Brake]], and [[Bill Duke]]. The film follows Red Miller (Cage) as he takes revenge on a [[hippie]] cult who murdered his wife. It premiered at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, and was theatrically released on September 14, 2018 by [[RLJE Films]]. ''Mandy'' was praised for its style and originality, Cage's performance, Cosmatos' direction, and the action sequences. It is one of the last films scored by Icelandic composer [[J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson]], who died in February 2018. The film is dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/johann-johannsson-cinema-soundscape-1202694619/|title=How Composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson Helped Change the Genre Cinema Soundscape|last = Debruge|first = Peter|date = February 10, 2018|work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date = March 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSomewhere near the [[Shadow Mountains]] in the year 1983, Red Miller lives with his girlfriend, artist Mandy Bloom, in a cabin near the lake. Red works as a logger, while Mandy has a day job as a cashier at a nearby gas station in the woods. She creates elaborate [[fantasy art]], and Red admires her work greatly. They lead a quiet and reclusive life, and their conversations and behavior hint at a complicated past and psychological hardship. Red appears to be a recovering alcoholic and possible veteran, and Mandy recounts traumatic childhood experiences.\n\nOn her way to work, Mandy walks past a van carrying the Children of the New Dawn, a deviant [[hippie]] [[cult]] led by Jeremiah Sand. Sand is struck by Mandy's beauty and orders one of his disciples, Brother Swan, to kidnap Mandy with the help of the Black Skulls, a demonic biker gang with a taste for human flesh and a liquid, highly potent form of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].\n\nAt night, Swan drives out to the lake and summons the Black Skulls by blowing a mystical horn. After Swan offers them a low-ranking member of the cult as a sacrifice, they break into the couple's home and subdue Mandy and Red. The two female members of the cult, Mother Marlene and Sister Lucy, drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a [[Sphex pensylvanicus|giant black wasp]] before presenting her to Sand. Sand \u2013 a failed musician \u2013 attempts to seduce Mandy with his [[psychedelic folk]] music, telling her that God had told him to take anything he wanted. Mandy ridicules him, leaving him confused and infuriated. Seeking revenge, Sand stabs Red, who is tied and gagged with barbed wire, then burns Mandy alive in front of him. After nothing but ash remains of Mandy, Sand and his followers leave. Red frees himself, mourns over Mandy's ashes, goes back inside, and falls asleep, exhausted and in shock. After waking up from a nightmare, he consumes a bottle of vodka, tends to his wounds, and shrieks in agony, grief, and rage.\n\nIn the morning, Red fetches \"the reaper,\" his crossbow, from his friend Caruthers. Caruthers provides him with freshly crafted arrows and information on the Black Skulls. According to Caruthers, the Black Skulls were drug couriers who turned murderously [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] after they had consumed a bad batch of LSD. Before Red leaves, Caruthers warns him that his odds of survival are poor. Red forges a battle axe and hunts down the bikers. Tracking the gang, he attempts to runs down and kills a trailing biker but is captured in the process. At their hideout, Red manages to break free and kill the bikers. In searching their hideout, he consumes some of their cocaine and tainted LSD, causing him to instantly and severely [[Hallucination|hallucinate]].\n\nSeeking out a radio tower he envisioned earlier, Red encounters The Chemist, a mysterious drug manufacturer, who tells him where to find the Children of the New Dawn. At their makeshift wooden church in a quarry, Red kills Brothers Swan and Hanker with his axe and kills Brother Klopek in a chainsaw duel, sparing only the life of Sister Lucy. Traversing the tunnels beneath the church, Red finds Mother Marlene and decapitates her. He then finds Sand, taunting him by rolling out Marlene's severed head. Sand begs for mercy, but Red kills him by crushing his skull. He sets the church on fire and watches Sand's body burn before driving away, envisioning Mandy in the passenger seat of his car, while the landscape behind him now appears fantastical and otherworldly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nicolas Cage]] as Red Miller<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\">{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3478741/mandy-poster-promises-nicolas-cage-chainsaw-battle/|title=The \u2018Mandy\u2019 Poster Promises a Nicolas Cage Chainsaw Battle!|last=Miska |first=Brad|date=January 16, 2018|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Riseborough]] as Mandy Bloom<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Linus Roache]] as Jeremiah Sand<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> \t\n*[[Bill Duke]]<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> as Caruthers\n*[[Richard Brake]] as The Chemist<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Ned Dennehy]] as Brother Swan<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]] as Mother Marlene<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*Hayley Saywell as Sis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shockya.com/news/2018/01/19/mandy-boy-girl-dream-love-election-night-sundance-film-festival/ |title=Mandy and A Boy.

A co-production of the United States and Canada, the film stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Linus Roache]], [[Ned Dennehy]], [[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Richard Brake]], and [[Bill Duke]]. It premiered at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, and was theatrically released on September 14, 2018 by [[RLJE Films]]. ''Mandy'' was praised for its style and originality, Cage's performance, Cosmatos' direction, and the action sequences. It is one of the last films scored by Icelandic composer [[J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson]], who died in February 2018.

Red works as a logger, while Mandy has a day job as a cashier at a nearby gas station in the woods. She creates elaborate [[fantasy art]], and Red admires her work greatly. They lead a quiet and reclusive life, and their conversations and behavior hint at a complicated past and psychological hardship. Red appears to be a recovering alcoholic and possible veteran, and Mandy recounts traumatic childhood experiences.\n\nOn her way to work, Mandy walks past a van carrying the Children of the New Dawn, a deviant [[hippie]] [[cult]] led by Jeremiah Sand. Sand is struck by Mandy's beauty and orders one of his disciples, Brother Swan, to kidnap Mandy with the help of the Black Skulls, a demonic biker gang with a taste for human flesh and a liquid, highly potent form of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].\n\nAt night, Swan drives out to the lake and summons the Black Skulls by blowing a mystical horn. After Swan offers them a low-ranking member of the cult as a sacrifice, they break into the couple's home and subdue Mandy and Red. The two female members of the cult, Mother Marlene and Sister Lucy, drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a [[Sphex pensylvanicus|giant black wasp]] before presenting her to Sand. Sand \u2013 a failed musician \u2013 attempts to seduce Mandy with his [[psychedelic folk]] music, telling her that God had told him to take anything he wanted. Mandy ridicules him, leaving him confused and infuriated. Seeking revenge, Sand stabs Red, who is tied and gagged with barbed wire, then burns Mandy alive in front of him. After nothing but ash remains of Mandy, Sand and his followers leave. Red frees himself, mourns over Mandy's ashes, goes back inside, and falls asleep, exhausted and in shock. After waking up from a nightmare, he consumes a bottle of vodka, tends to his wounds, and shrieks in agony, grief, and rage.\n\nIn the morning, Red fetches \"the reaper,\" his crossbow, from his friend Caruthers. Caruthers provides him with freshly crafted arrows and information on the Black Skulls. According to Caruthers, the Black Skulls were drug couriers who turned murderously [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] after they had consumed a bad batch of LSD. Before Red leaves, Caruthers warns him that his odds of survival are poor. Red forges a battle axe and hunts down the bikers. Tracking the gang, he attempts to runs down and kills a trailing biker but is captured in the process. At their hideout, Red manages to break free and kill the bikers. In searching their hideout, he consumes some of their cocaine and tainted LSD, causing him to instantly and severely [[Hallucination|hallucinate]].\n\nSeeking out a radio tower he envisioned earlier, Red encounters The Chemist, a mysterious drug manufacturer, who tells him where to find the Children of the New Dawn. At their makeshift wooden church in a quarry, Red kills Brothers Swan and Hanker with his axe and kills Brother Klopek in a chainsaw duel, sparing only the life of Sister Lucy. Traversing the tunnels beneath the church, Red finds Mother Marlene and decapitates her. He then finds Sand, taunting him by rolling out Marlene's severed head. Sand begs for mercy, but Red kills him by crushing his skull. He sets the church on fire and watches Sand's body burn before driving away, envisioning Mandy in the passenger seat of his car, while the landscape behind him now appears fantastical and otherworldly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nicolas Cage]] as Red Miller<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\">{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3478741/mandy-poster-promises-nicolas-cage-chainsaw-battle/|title=The \u2018Mandy\u2019 Poster Promises a Nicolas Cage Chainsaw Battle!|last=Miska |first=Brad|date=January 16, 2018|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Riseborough]] as Mandy Bloom<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Linus Roache]] as Jeremiah Sand<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> \t\n*[[Bill Duke]]<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> as Caruthers\n*[[Richard Brake]] as The Chemist<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Ned Dennehy]] as Brother Swan<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]] as Mother Marlene<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*Hayley Saywell as Sis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shockya.com/news/2018/01/19/mandy-boy-girl-dream-love-election-night-sundance-film-festival/ |title=Mandy and A Boy.
