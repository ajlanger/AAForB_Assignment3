This is because the luminance (which is essentially \"brightness\" in visible light) of a heated [[black body]] (closely approximated by the photosphere) at these temperatures varies extremely with temperature\u2014considerably more so than the (temperature to the fourth power) variation in the total [[black-body radiation]] at all wavelengths (see [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]). Isolated from the surrounding photosphere a sunspot would be brighter than the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot.html|title=Sunspots|publisher=NASA|date=1 April 1998|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nSunspots have two parts: the central [[wikt:umbra|umbra]], which is the darkest part, where the magnetic field is approximately vertical ([[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the Sun's surface) and the surrounding [[wikt:penumbra|penumbra]], which is lighter, where the magnetic field is more inclined.\n\n=== Lifecycle ===\n\nAny given appearance of a sunspot may last anywhere from a few days to a few months, though groups of sunspots and their active regions tend to last weeks or months, but all do eventually decay and disappear. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun, with diameters ranging from {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}} to {{convert|160000|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlthough the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of [[Flux tube|magnetic flux tube]]s in the Sun's [[Convection zone|convective zone]] that get \"wound up\" by [[differential rotation]]. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases, and with it, surface temperature.\n\nThe [[Wilson effect]] implies that sunspots are depressions on the Sun's surface. Observations using the [[Zeeman effect]] show that prototypical sunspots come in pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. From cycle to cycle, the polarities of leading and trailing (with respect to the solar rotation) sunspots change from north/south to south/north and back. Sunspots usually appear in groups.\n\n[[Magnetic pressure]] should tend to remove field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local [[helioseismology]]) were used to develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft underneath each sunspot, forms a rotating [[vortex]] that sustains the concentrated magnetic field.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOHO reveals how sunspots take stranglehold on the Sun|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0111/06sunspots/|newspaper=SpaceFlight Now|date=6 November 2001|author=NASA News Release}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar cycle ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Butterfly diagram showing paired [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]] behavior|alt=Point chart showing sunspot area as percent of the total area at various latitudes, above grouped bar chart showing average daily sunspot area as % of visible hemisphere.]]\n\nSunspot activity cycles are about every eleven years, with some variation in length. Over the solar cycle, sunspot populations rise quickly and then fall more slowly.  The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle is known as solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as solar minimum.  This period is also observed in most other [[Solar phenomena|solar activity]] and is linked to a variation in the solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.\n\nEarly in the cycle, sunspots appear in the higher latitudes and then move towards the equator as the cycle approaches maximum, following [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]]. Spots from two adjacent cycles can co-exist for some time. Spots from adjacent cycles can be distinguished by direction of their magnetic field.\n\n[[Wolf number|The Wolf number]] sunspot index counts the average number of sunspots and groups of sunspots during specific intervals. The 11-year solar cycles are numbered sequentially, starting with the observations made in the 1750s.<ref name=\"testtest1\">{{cite book\n| author=Tribble, A.  |date=2003\n| title=The Space Environment, Implications for Spacecraft Design\n| publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\n[[George Ellery Hale]] first linked magnetic fields and sunspots in 1908.<ref name=\"doi10.1086/141602\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hale | first1 = G.

The [[Babcock Model]] explains that magnetic fields cause the behavior described by Sp\u00f6rer's law, as well as other effects, which are twisted by the Sun's rotation.\n\n=== Longer-period trends ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n\nSunspot number also changes over long periods.

These telescopes use filtration and projection techniques for direct observation, in addition to various types of filtered cameras. Specialized tools such as [[spectroscope]]s and [[spectrohelioscope]]s are used to examine sunspots and sunspot areas.

Small sections of very dark [[optical filter|filter glass]], such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope [[eyepiece]] can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha]] narrow bandpass filters and [[vacuum deposition|aluminum-coated]] glass [[attenuation]] filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high [[optical density]]) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.\n\n== Application ==\n\nDue to its link to other kinds of [[solar variation|solar activity]], sunspot occurrence can be used to help predict [[space weather]], the state of the [[ionosphere]], and hence the conditions of [[short-wave]] [[radio propagation]] or [[satellite communication]]s. High sunspot activity is celebrated by members of the amateur radio community as a harbinger of excellent ionospheric propagation conditions that greatly increase radio range in the [[High Frequency|HF]] bands. During sunspot peaks, worldwide radio communication can be possible on frequencies as high as the [[6-meter band|6-meter VHF band]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hamradioschool.com/sunspots-and-propagation/|title=Sunspots and Propagation|author=Stu Turner|publisher=Ham Radio School.com|access-date=5 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626024320/http://www.hamradioschool.com/sunspots-and-propagation/|archive-date=26 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Solar activity and climate|Solar activity]] (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in [[global warming]], originally the role of the [[Maunder Minimum]] of sunspot occurrence in the [[Little Ice Age]] in European winter climate.<ref name=\"MM_PAPER\">{{cite journal |author=Eddy J.A. |title=The Maunder Minimum |journal=Science |volume=192 |issue=4245 |pages=1189\u20131202 |date=June 1976 |pmid=17771739 |doi=10.1126/science.192.4245.1189 |bibcode=1976Sci...192.1189E }} [http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf PDF Copy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216030712/http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf |date=16 February 2010 }}</ref> Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on solar flux<ref>{{Cite web\n| author=Hudson H |date=2008 \n| title=Solar activity |publisher=Scholarpedia \n| url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Solar_activity |accessdate=2011-01-27\n}}</ref> however the total solar flux increases as \"At solar maximum the Sun is some 0.1% brighter than its solar-minimum level\".

This is because the luminance (which is essentially \"brightness\" in visible light) of a heated [[black body]] (closely approximated by the photosphere) at these temperatures varies extremely with temperature\u2014considerably more so than the (temperature to the fourth power) variation in the total [[black-body radiation]] at all wavelengths (see [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]). Isolated from the surrounding photosphere a sunspot would be brighter than the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot.html|title=Sunspots|publisher=NASA|date=1 April 1998|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nSunspots have two parts: the central [[wikt:umbra|umbra]], which is the darkest part, where the magnetic field is approximately vertical ([[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the Sun's surface) and the surrounding [[wikt:penumbra|penumbra]], which is lighter, where the magnetic field is more inclined.\n\n=== Lifecycle ===\n\nAny given appearance of a sunspot may last anywhere from a few days to a few months, though groups of sunspots and their active regions tend to last weeks or months, but all do eventually decay and disappear. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun, with diameters ranging from {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}} to {{convert|160000|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlthough the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of [[Flux tube|magnetic flux tube]]s in the Sun's [[Convection zone|convective zone]] that get \"wound up\" by [[differential rotation]]. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases, and with it, surface temperature.\n\nThe [[Wilson effect]] implies that sunspots are depressions on the Sun's surface. Observations using the [[Zeeman effect]] show that prototypical sunspots come in pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. From cycle to cycle, the polarities of leading and trailing (with respect to the solar rotation) sunspots change from north/south to south/north and back. Sunspots usually appear in groups.\n\n[[Magnetic pressure]] should tend to remove field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local [[helioseismology]]) were used to develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft underneath each sunspot, forms a rotating [[vortex]] that sustains the concentrated magnetic field.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOHO reveals how sunspots take stranglehold on the Sun|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0111/06sunspots/|newspaper=SpaceFlight Now|date=6 November 2001|author=NASA News Release}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar cycle ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Butterfly diagram showing paired [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]] behavior|alt=Point chart showing sunspot area as percent of the total area at various latitudes, above grouped bar chart showing average daily sunspot area as % of visible hemisphere.]]\n\nSunspot activity cycles are about every eleven years, with some variation in length. Over the solar cycle, sunspot populations rise quickly and then fall more slowly.  The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle is known as solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as solar minimum.  This period is also observed in most other [[Solar phenomena|solar activity]] and is linked to a variation in the solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.\n\nEarly in the cycle, sunspots appear in the higher latitudes and then move towards the equator as the cycle approaches maximum, following [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]]. Spots from two adjacent cycles can co-exist for some time. Spots from adjacent cycles can be distinguished by direction of their magnetic field.\n\n[[Wolf number|The Wolf number]] sunspot index counts the average number of sunspots and groups of sunspots during specific intervals. The 11-year solar cycles are numbered sequentially, starting with the observations made in the 1750s.<ref name=\"testtest1\">{{cite book\n| author=Tribble, A.  |date=2003\n| title=The Space Environment, Implications for Spacecraft Design\n| publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\n[[George Ellery Hale]] first linked magnetic fields and sunspots in 1908.<ref name=\"doi10.1086/141602\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hale | first1 = G.

Small sections of very dark [[optical filter|filter glass]], such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope [[eyepiece]] can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha]] narrow bandpass filters and [[vacuum deposition|aluminum-coated]] glass [[attenuation]] filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high [[optical density]]) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.\n\n== Application ==\n\nDue to its link to other kinds of [[solar variation|solar activity]], sunspot occurrence can be used to help predict [[space weather]], the state of the [[ionosphere]], and hence the conditions of [[short-wave]] [[radio propagation]] or [[satellite communication]]s. High sunspot activity is celebrated by memebers of the amateur radio community as a harbinger of excellent ionospheric propogation conditions that greatly increase radio range in the [[High Frequency|HF]] bands.

For example, in 1999, Strassmeier reported the largest cool starspot ever seen rotating the giant [[Stellar classification#Class K|K0]]&nbsp;star XX&nbsp;Triangulum (HD&nbsp;12545) with a temperature of {{convert|3500|K|C}}, together with a warm spot of {{convert|4800|K|C}}.<ref name=\"strassmeier\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.de/groups/activity/pics/DI/12545s4e.gif |title=Derived images showing rotation of cool and warm starspots |publisher=Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics |access-date=2013-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529200045/http://www.aip.de/groups/activity/pics/DI/12545s4e.gif |archive-date=29 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery style=\"margin:auto;\">\nImage:Sunspots 1302 Sep 2011 by NASA.jpg|Sunspots, September 2011.\nImage:Sunspot 1112.jpg|A view of the coronal structure above a different sunspot seen in October 2010.\nImage:Sunspot 923 at sunset and in solar telescope.jpg|Sunspot 923 at sunset and in solar scope.\nImage:Sunspot Mirage.JPG|Sunset [[superior mirage]] of sunspot #930.\nImage:Sun spot naked eye.jpg|Sunset in Bangladesh, January 2004.\nImage:PIA19801-TrackingSunspotsOnTheSunFromMars-20150708.gif|Tracking sunspots from [[Mars]] (animation; 8 July 2015).\n</gallery>\n\n=== Videos ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| image1    = NOAA 875.ogv\n| width1    = 250\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Photospheric broadband image from flaring Sunspot NOAA 875 as observed with the GREGOR Fabry-P\u00e9rot Interferometer on 26 April 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal |bibcode = 2007msfa.conf...45P|title = From the \"G\u00f6ttingen\" Fabry-Perot Interferometer to the GREGOR FPI|journal = Modern Solar Facilities - Advanced Solar Science|pages = 45|last1 = Puschmann|first1 = K.
