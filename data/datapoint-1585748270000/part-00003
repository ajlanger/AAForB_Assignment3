Deletions that do not occur in multiples of three bases can cause a [[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]] by changing the 3-nucleotide protein reading frame of the genetic sequence. Deletions are representative of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, including humans and not in [[prokaryotic]] organisms, such as bacteria.\n\n==Causes==\nCauses include the following:\n* Losses from [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]\n* [[Chromosomal crossover]]s within a [[chromosomal inversion]]\n* [[Unequal crossing over]]\n* Breaking without rejoining\n\nFor [[synapsis]] to occur between a chromosome with a large intercalary deficiency and a normal complete homolog, the unpaired region of the normal homolog must loop out of the linear structure into a '''deletion''' or '''compensation loop'''.\n\n==Types==\nTypes of deletion include the following:\n*'''Terminal deletion''' \u2013 a deletion that occurs towards the end of a chromosome.\n*'''Intercalary deletion/interstitial addition''' \u2013 a deletion that occurs from the interior of a chromosome.\n*'''Micro-deletion''' \u2013 a relatively small amount of deletion (up to 5Mb that could include a dozen genes).\n\nMicro-deletion is usually found in children with physical abnormalities. A large amount of deletion would result in immediate abortion (miscarriage).\n\n==Effects==\n\nSmall deletions are less likely to be fatal; large deletions are usually fatal \u2013 there are always variations based on which genes are lost. Some medium-sized deletions lead to recognizable human disorders, e.g. [[Williams syndrome]].\n\nDeletion of a number of pairs that is not evenly divisible by three will lead to a [[frameshift mutation]], causing all of the [[codon]]s occurring after the deletion to be read incorrectly during [[translation (genetics)|translation]], producing a severely altered and potentially nonfunctional [[protein]]. In contrast, a deletion that is evenly divisible by three is called an ''in-frame'' deletion.<ref>[http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms LSDB \u2014 Controlled vocabulary terms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006070438/http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms |date=2011-10-06 }} at The GEN2PHEN Knowledge Centre.
