It is a part of the [[University System of Maryland]]. Founded in 1866 as Maryland's first [[normal school|training school]] for teachers, Towson University has evolved into a university with eight colleges and over 20,000 students. Towson is one of the largest public universities in Maryland and still produces the most teachers of any university in the state.  Towson University is ranked as the 98th-best public university and 197th-best overall university nationally in the  2020 [[U.S. News & World Report]] rankings.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Chronology of Towson University}}\n\n===Maryland State Normal School===\n[[Image:TUNewell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[McFadden Newell|McFadden Alexander Newell]]]]\nThe [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] established what would eventually become Towson University in 1865, with the allocation of funds directed toward Maryland's first teacher-training school, or then called \"[[normal school]]\" (term used from a new French tradition).<ref name=\"TUHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.towson.edu/main/abouttu/glance/history.asp |title=History \u2013 Towson At a Glance |accessdate=2007-09-11 |publisher=Towson University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107000456/http://www.towson.edu/main/abouttu/glance/history.asp |archivedate=2008-01-07 }}</ref> On January 15, 1866, this institution, known then as the \"Maryland State Normal School\" (M.S.N.S.), officially opened its doors as part of the substantial modern educational reforms prescribed by the Unionist/Radical Republican Party-dominated [[Maryland Constitution of 1864]] of the [[American Civil War|Civil War-era]] state government, which provided for a new state superintendent of public instruction and a Board of Education to be appointed to advise and supervise the counties, in addition to the already progressive public educational system previously established in 1829 in Baltimore City.<ref name=\"MDEN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdoe.org/towson_u.html |title=Towson University |accessdate=2007-09-11 |publisher=Maryland Online Encyclopedia}}</ref> Located then at Red Man's Hall on North Paca Street in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the new teachers' school originally enrolled eleven students and fostered three faculty members.<ref name=\"Tower1\">{{cite web |url=http://media.www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2002/04/29/News/Renovations.Build.On.History.Of.University-2197491.shtml?sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |title=Renovations build on history of Towson University |accessdate=2007-07-25 |last=Bridge |first=James |date=April 2002 |publisher=The Towerlight |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222030/http://media.www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2002/04/29/News/Renovations.Build.On.History.Of.University-2197491.shtml?sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Chronicle\">{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/jobs/profiles/1621.htm |title=Employer Profile |accessdate=2007-08-02 |publisher=Chronicle Careers}}</ref> [[McFadden Alexander Newell]] served as the school's first principal as well as the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and oversaw the first graduating class of sixteen students in June 1866.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the enrollment in the school grew exponentially. The State Normal School soon quickly outgrew its temporary facilities in Red Man's Hall on Paca Street and moved to another temporary location in 1873 on the northeast corner of [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles]] and East Franklin Streets, in the former William Howard [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] mansion (son of famous [[American Revolutionary War]] Col. [[John Eager Howard]] of the famous \"[[Maryland Line]]\" in the [[Continental Army]] who owned most of the land north of Baltimore Town as his estate of \"Belvidere\" or \"Howard's Woods\"), and his family was now starting to develop and lay out city streets.

In 1876, the Normal School moved its faculty and 206 students to this new landmark facility located in West Baltimore facing Lafayette Square on Carrollton and Lafayette Avenues.<ref name=\"Tower1\"/><ref name=\"Chronicle\"/>\n\n===Move to Towson===\n[[Image:TUStephConstr.jpg|thumb|right|Stephens Hall, under construction in 1914.]]\n[[File:Department of Public Education State of Maryland.

(1916) (14582037719).jpg|thumb|right|Newell Hall, 1916]]\nThe demand for qualified teachers became overwhelming by the turn of the century. The [[Maryland Department of Education]] reported an annual need for 350 new teachers, but the Maryland State Normal School was graduating fewer than 100.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/> The facilities in West Baltimore were now inadequate to meet state demands. Principal [[Sarah Richmond]], one of the original eleven graduates, began a campaign to establish a campus where the school could function more appropriately. In 1910, the General Assembly formed a committee to oversee site selection, budget, and design plans for the new campus. [[John Charles Linthicum]] was appointed president of the committee, alongside State Superintendent M. Bates Stephens and Sarah Richmond. The committee surveyed locations at [[Roland Park, Baltimore|Roland Park]], [[Lutherville-Timonium, Maryland|Lutherville-Timonium]], [[Mount Washington, Baltimore|Mount Washington]], [[Pimlico, Baltimore|Pimlico]], Glencoe, and many other areas.<ref name=\"Chronicle\"/> Eventually, the committee settled on an {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in Towson and the General Assembly financed the $600,000 move in 1912.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/> Construction began in 1913 on the Administration Building, now known as Stephens Hall. In September 1915, the new campus, comprising Stephens Hall, Newell Hall, and the power plant, began classes.<ref name=\"Chrono\"/>\n\n===Name changes===\nIn 1934, the state decreed that new public school teachers must have [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate degrees]] instead of two-year teaching certificates, and the school retooled its curriculum to issue [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/> The following year, the school changed its name to '''Maryland State Teachers College at Towson'''.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/><ref name=\"Chrono\"/> As the name implied, the college's single purpose was to train teachers. In 1946, however, the institution established a junior college to offer two years of college work on a transfer basis. This expansion laid the foundation of what was later to become the art and sciences program. In 1958, the college offered its first graduate program leading to a [[Master of Education]] degree. In 1960, the college expanded the art and science programs into four-year courses and began awarding bachelor's degrees in these fields. Due to this change in focus, the name changed once more to '''Towson State College'''.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/><ref name=\"MDEN\"/>\n\nBeginning in 1964, the college enrollment rates began a dramatic increase as the [[baby boomer]] generation began applying to colleges.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/> Within a decade, Towson State's enrollment climbed from 3,537 to 13,399.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/> This expansion led to the construction of the Center for the Arts, University Union, Cook Library, and many other new facilities. Under the presidency of James L. Fisher, the college expanded the courses offered to meet the demands of the growing student body. In 1976, the school's name changed again to '''Towson State University'''. In 1988, TU joined 10 other public institutions in the newly created [[University System of Maryland]]. On July 1, 1997, another name change took effect. Towson dropped the designation \"state\" from its name and became Towson University. The new name recognized shifts in funding and the development and growth of Towson as a [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] university.<ref name=\"Chronicle\"/>\n\n===2014 Barry Freundel voyeurism

All of the major athletic teams compete in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] with 20 Division I athletic teams (13 in women's sports, 7 in men's sports).\n\nUnder the leadership of President Bob Caret the University placed a greater emphasis on the athletics program.  In September 2010 Caret hired a new Director of Athletics, [[Michael P. Waddell]], who had significant program building experience at the highest levels of college sports and led the Tigers to unprecedented success during his three years at the helm, including eleven (11) CAA Regular Season & Tournament Championships. Waddell left Towson in 2013 for the University of Arkansas and was replaced by Tim Leonard.\n\nTowson University offers the most comprehensive sports program in the metropolitan Baltimore area, fielding 20 varsity teams that compete in the Colonial Athletic Association. Since joining the league in 2001\u201302, the Tigers have won CAA titles in men's and women's lacrosse, women's swimming, men's soccer, men's golf, baseball, and football. During an athletics history that traces its roots to the 1920s, Towson has sent teams and individual student-athletes to NCAA post-season competition in baseball, basketball, football, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, track & field and volleyball.\n\nEleven Tigers have been named CAA Scholar-Athlete Award Winners for their respective sports, including the 2010 cross country recipient, Brandi Gervais, a senior Biology/Pre-Dentistry Major with a perfect 4.0 GPA. A number of student-athletes have gone on to enjoy professional careers, including most recently Jermon Bushrod, the starting left offensive tackle for the 2009 Super Bowl Champion New Orleans Saints; former MLB outfielder Casper Wells; and former NBA shooting guard Gary Neal.\n\n==Towson Tiger==\n{{Main|Doc (mascot)}}\nBefore the 1960s, the name of the sports teams at Towson were known as the \"Towson College Knights\". Towson student [[John Schuerholz]] pushed for a new mascot, and the tiger was officially adopted in 1962. Schuerholz later became general manager and then president of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The university's present baseball complex is named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presidentcaret.org/blog/?p=24|title=The Meaning of a Mascot|accessdate=2007-07-25|last=Caret|first=Robert|publisher=President's Caret's Blog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705004707/http://presidentcaret.org/blog/?p=24|archivedate=2007-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to school newspaper ''[[The Towerlight]]'', when the Student Government Association first bought the tiger statue that sits outside Cook Library in 1996, the organization hoped to boost school spirit. Instead, it became subject to vandalism and disrepair. In March 2006, after several acts of vandalism, the statue was completely removed from in front of the library.\n\nIn September 2006, the Towerlight reported that a new bronze tiger statue had been unveiled as the centerpiece of the university's \"Capital Campaign\" to raise $50 million. The primary difference between the new statue and previous one is that the new one is made of bronze and all of the legs are on the ground and the tail is wrapped around its legs rather than raised, so it won't get damaged by vandals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/11/06/News/New-Tiger.Statue.Debuts-2440106.shtml?norewrite200611101151&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|title=Tiger Statue Debuts|accessdate=2007-07-25|last=Funderburk|first=Kristi|date=November 2006|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071202024846/http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/11/06/News/New-Tiger.Statue.Debuts-2440106.shtml?norewrite200611101151&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|archivedate=2007-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe new statue is outside Stephens Hall and was unveiled on February 8, 2007 where Caret said it would be  \"visible to passersby on York Road as well as students\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/12/11/CrystalBall/In.With.2007.The.Future.Of.Towson.University-2531535-page4.shtml?norewrite200612111128&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|title=The Future of Towson University|accessdate=2007-07-25|date=December 2006|publisher=The Towerlight|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071202032058/http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/12/11/CrystalBall/In.With.2007.The.Future.Of.Towson.University-2531535-page4.shtml?norewrite200612111128&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|archivedate=2007-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1213298171.html?dids=1213298171:1213298171&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+9%2C+2007&author=Julie+Scharper&pub=The+Sun&desc=BRONZE+MASCOT+SHOULD+STAND+UP+TO+PROWLING+VANDALS+ |title=Towson's new Tiger built to last |accessdate=2007-07-25 |last=Scharper |first=Julie |date= December 2007 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001063827/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1213298171.html?dids=1213298171:1213298171&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+9,+2007&author=Julie+Scharper&pub=The+Sun&desc=BRONZE+MASCOT+SHOULD+STAND+UP+TO+PROWLING+VANDALS+|archivedate=2007-10-01|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Tigerfest===\nTigerfest is TU's annual spring festival that features interactive activities for students, as well as live musical entertainment.

(1916) (14582037719).jpg|thumb|right|Newell Hall, 1916]]\nThe demand for qualified teachers became overwhelming by the turn of the century. The [[Maryland Department of Education]] reported an annual need for 350 new teachers, but the Maryland State Normal School was graduating fewer than 100.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/> The facilities in West Baltimore were now inadequate to meet state demands. Principal [[Sarah Richmond]], one of the original eleven graduates, began a campaign to establish a campus where the school could function more appropriately. In 1910, the General Assembly formed a committee to oversee site selection, budget, and design plans for the new campus. [[John Charles Linthicum]] was appointed president of the committee, alongside State Superintendent M. Bates Stephens and Sarah Richmond. The committee surveyed locations at [[Roland Park, Baltimore|Roland Park]], [[Lutherville-Timonium, Maryland|Lutherville-Timonium]], [[Mount Washington, Baltimore|Mount Washington]], [[Pimlico, Baltimore|Pimlico]], Glencoe, and many other areas.<ref name=\"Chronicle\"/> Eventually, the committee settled on an {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in Towson and the General Assembly financed the $600,000 move in 1912.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/> Construction began in 1913 on the Administration Building, now known as Stephens Hall. In September 1915, the new campus, comprising Stephens Hall, Newell Hall, and the power plant, began classes.<ref name=\"Chrono\"/>\n\n===Name changes===\nIn 1934, the state decreed that new public school teachers must have [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate degrees]] instead of two-year teaching certificates, and the school retooled its curriculum to issue [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/> The following year, the school changed its name to '''Maryland State Teachers College at Towson'''.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/><ref name=\"Chrono\"/> As the name implied, the college's single purpose was to train teachers. In 1946, however, the institution established a junior college to offer two years of college work on a transfer basis. This expansion laid the foundation of what was later to become the art and sciences program. In 1958, the college offered its first graduate program leading to a [[Master of Education]] degree. In 1960, the college expanded the art and science programs into four-year courses and began awarding bachelor's degrees in these fields. Due to this change in focus, the name changed once more to '''Towson State College'''.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/><ref name=\"MDEN\"/>\n\nBeginning in 1964, the college enrollment rates began a dramatic increase as the [[baby boomer]] generation began applying to colleges.<ref name=\"MDEN\"/> Within a decade, Towson State's enrollment climbed from 3,537 to 13,399.<ref name=\"TUHistory\"/> This expansion led to the construction of the Center for the Arts, University Union, Cook Library, and many other new facilities. Under the presidency of James L. Fisher, the college expanded the courses offered to meet the demands of the growing student body. In 1976, the school's name changed again to '''Towson State University'''. In 1988, TU joined 10 other public institutions in the newly created [[University System of Maryland]]. On July 1, 1997, another name change took effect. Towson dropped the designation \"state\" from its name and became Towson University. The new name recognized shifts in funding and the development and growth of Towson as a [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] university.<ref name=\"Chronicle\"/>\n\n===2014 Barry Freundel voyeurism

The primary difference between the new statue and previous one is that the new one is made of bronze and all of the legs are on the ground and the tail is wrapped around its legs rather than raised, so it won't get damaged by vandals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/11/06/News/New-Tiger.Statue.Debuts-2440106.shtml?norewrite200611101151&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|title=Tiger Statue Debuts|accessdate=2007-07-25|last=Funderburk|first=Kristi|date=November 2006|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071202024846/http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/11/06/News/New-Tiger.Statue.Debuts-2440106.shtml?norewrite200611101151&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|archivedate=2007-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe new statue is outside Stephens Hall and was unveiled on February 8, 2007 where Caret said it would be  \"visible to passersby on York Road as well as students\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/12/11/CrystalBall/In.With.2007.The.Future.Of.Towson.University-2531535-page4.shtml?norewrite200612111128&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|title=The Future of Towson University|accessdate=2007-07-25|date=December 2006|publisher=The Towerlight|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071202032058/http://www.thetowerlight.com/media/storage/paper957/news/2006/12/11/CrystalBall/In.With.2007.The.Future.Of.Towson.University-2531535-page4.shtml?norewrite200612111128&sourcedomain=www.thetowerlight.com|archivedate=2007-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1213298171.html?dids=1213298171:1213298171&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+9%2C+2007&author=Julie+Scharper&pub=The+Sun&desc=BRONZE+MASCOT+SHOULD+STAND+UP+TO+PROWLING+VANDALS+ |title=Towson's new Tiger built to last |accessdate=2007-07-25 |last=Scharper |first=Julie |date= December 2007 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001063827/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1213298171.html?dids=1213298171:1213298171&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+9,+2007&author=Julie+Scharper&pub=The+Sun&desc=BRONZE+MASCOT+SHOULD+STAND+UP+TO+PROWLING+VANDALS+|archivedate=2007-10-01|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Tigerfest===\nTigerfest is TU's annual spring festival that features interactive activities for students, as well as live musical entertainment. Tigerfest, which is also open to the public (not just TU students), occurs in late April and was held in [[Johnny Unitas Stadium]] for most of the event's history. Starting in 2014, the event was moved to Towson's brand new basketball arena, [[SECU Arena]]. Also beginning in 2014 was the festival being held over two days. Day one features events and games on campus, while day two is centered around a concert. Artists such as [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], [[Krewella]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[The Used]], and [[Yellowcard]] have appeared at Tigerfest in the past.\n\n==Community outreach==\n\n===Division of Economic and Community Outreach===\nThe Division of Economic and Community Outreach (DECO) was established in 2004 as an initiative of President Robert L. Caret. DECO's charge is to \"provide a focus for engagement with the external community and to provide a path into the university's research and project talent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towson.edu/outreach/|title=Division of Innovation & Applied Research \u2013 Towson University|work=towson.edu}}</ref> DECO includes over 130 experts in the following areas: IT [[Solution]]s, Mapping Solutions (GIS), Technical Training, Applied Economics and Human Services, Information Assurance, and Business Growth.\n\n===Cherry Hill Learning Zone===\nThe initiative is a partnership among the [[Baltimore City Public School System]], Baltimore City government, Towson University and Cherry Hill's community organizations. Together, the programs are trying to rebuild the Cherry Hill neighborhood in southern Baltimore. The program interacts with Cherry Hill's civic leaders, community organizations and citizens, the Learning Zone hopes to serve as a resource for the academic progress of Cherry Hill's young residents and improvement of the overall environment in the community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwnew.towson.edu/cherryhill/index.asp|title=The Cherry Hill Learning Zone|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=Towson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020809/http://wwwnew.towson.edu/cherryhill/index.asp|archivedate=2007-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwnew.towson.edu/cherryhill/videos.asp|title=Cherry Hill Learning Zone video|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=Towson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202730/http://wwwnew.towson.edu/cherryhill/videos.asp|archivedate=2007-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Urban Debate League===\n{{See also|Baltimore Urban Debate League}}\nThe [[Towson University Speech and Debate|Towson Speech and Debate]] team has close ties with the [[Baltimore Urban Debate League]] and often volunteers people from the team and the university to judge and facilitate the running of the tournaments.\n\nThe university often acts as a host for league tournaments at least once a year.\n\nTowson also has what they call an ''Urban Debate Scholar'' award that they give to one graduating senior every year. The scholarship pays for full tuition and fees at TU. They also offer varying awards between $2,000 \u2013 $4,000 to other graduating seniors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwnew.towson.edu/speechanddebate/pages/scholarships.html|title=Scholarship Opportunities|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=Towson Speech and Debate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810224602/http://wwwnew.towson.edu/speechanddebate/pages/scholarships.html|archivedate=2007-08-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Adopt-A-Campus===\nFormer President Caret established a program called ''Adopt-A-Campus'', which gives local businesses, organizations and others an opportunity to help beautify the TU campus.
