When recording a cyclical process for industrial breakdown analysis, only the relevant part of each cycle is filmed.\n\nA problem for high-speed cameras is the needed [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] for the film; very bright light is needed to be able to film at 40,000&nbsp;fps, sometimes leading to the subject of examination being destroyed because of the heat of the lighting.\nMonochromatic (black and white) filming is sometimes used to reduce the light intensity required.\nEven higher speed imaging is possible using specialized electronic [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) imaging systems, which can achieve speeds of over 25&nbsp;million fps.

Such triggering can also be used to synchronize recording across multiple cameras.\n\nThe explosion of alkali metals on contact with water has been studied using a high-speed camera.

One of the basic analysis techniques is to use high-speed cameras in order to characterize events which happen too fast to see, e.g. during production. Similar to use in science, with a pre- or post-triggering capability the camera can simply record continuously as the mechanic waits for the breakdown to happen, following which a trigger signal (internal or external) will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval prior to the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size, and memory capacity during continuous recording). Some software allows viewing the issues in real time, by displaying only a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size and watch time issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest.\n\nHigh-speed video cameras are used to augment other industrial technologies such as x-ray radiography.  When used with the proper phosphor screen which converts x-rays into visible light, high-speed cameras can be used to capture high-speed x-ray videos of events inside mechanical devices and biological specimens. The imaging speed is mainly limited by the phosphor screen decay rate and intensity gain which has a direct relationship on the camera's exposure. Pulsed x-ray sources limit frame rate and should be properly synchronized with camera frame captures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aimed-research.com/Services.html | title=High-Speed Imaging Services - Aimed Research}}</ref>\n\n==Uses in warfare==\nIn 1950 [[Morton Sultanoff]], an engineer for the U.S.&nbsp;Army at Aberdeen Proving ground, invented a super high-speed camera that took frames at one-millionth of a second, and was fast enough to record the shock wave of a small explosion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA158&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WSfYT4GmKcOA2wW3ycWOCw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Super Speed Camera Films Shock Wave\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1950, p. 158.</ref> High Speed digital cameras have been used to study how mines dropped from the air will deploy in near-shore regions,<ref>weapon development{{cite web |last= Chu |first= Dr. Peter C. |title= Non-Cylindrical Mine Drop Experiment |url= http://faculty.nps.edu/pcchu/web_paper/proceedings/jcot/midex2.pdf |accessdate= 4 May 2006 |publisher= Seventh International Symposium on Technology and Mine Problem, NPS, Monterey, California, USA }}.

Most software allows saving a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest. Such triggering can also be used to synchronize recording across multiple cameras.\n\nThe explosion of alkali metals on contact with water has been studied using a high-speed camera. Frame-by-frame analysis of a sodium/potassium alloy exploding in water, combined with molecular dynamic simulations, suggested that the initial expansion may be the result of a [[Coulomb explosion]] and not combustion of hydrogen gas as previously thought.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Philip E.|last2=Uhlig|first2=Frank|last3=Van\u011bk|first3=V\u00e1clav|last4=Buttersack|first4=Tillmann|last5=Bauerecker|first5=Sigurd|last6=Jungwirth|first6=Pavel|date=2015-03-01|title=Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=250\u2013254|doi=10.1038/nchem.2161|pmid=25698335|issn=1755-4330|bibcode=2015NatCh...7..250M}}</ref>\n\nDigital high-speed camera footage has strongly contributed to the understanding of [[lightning]] when combined with [[electric field]] measuring instrumentation and sensors which can map the propagation of lightning leaders through the detection of [[radio waves]] generated by this process.<ref name=ztresearch>{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ |website=ZT Research |access-date=8 September 2018|title=Education |date=2017-05-06 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses in industry==\nWhen moving from reactive maintenance to [[predictive maintenance]], it is crucial that breakdowns are really understood. One of the basic analysis techniques is to use high-speed cameras in order to characterize events which happen too fast to see, e.g. during production. Similar to use in science, with a pre- or post-triggering capability the camera can simply record continuously as the mechanic waits for the breakdown to happen, following which a trigger signal (internal or external) will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval prior to the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size, and memory capacity during continuous recording). Some software allows viewing the issues in real time, by displaying only a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size and watch time issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest.\n\nHigh-speed video cameras are used to augment other industrial technologies such as x-ray radiography.  When used with the proper phosphor screen which converts x-rays into visible light, high-speed cameras can be used to capture high-speed x-ray videos of events inside mechanical devices and biological specimens. The imaging speed is mainly limited by the phosphor screen decay rate and intensity gain which has a direct relationship on the camera's exposure. Pulsed x-ray sources limit frame rate and should be properly synchronized with camera frame captures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aimed-research.com/Services.html | title=High-Speed Imaging Services - Aimed Research}}</ref>\n\n==Uses in warfare==\nIn 1950 [[Morton Sultanoff]], an engineer for the U.S.&nbsp;Army at Aberdeen Proving ground, invented a super high-speed camera that took frames at one-millionth of a second, and was fast enough to record the shock wave of a small explosion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA158&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WSfYT4GmKcOA2wW3ycWOCw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Super Speed Camera Films Shock Wave\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1950, p. 158.</ref> High Speed digital cameras have been used to study how mines dropped from the air will deploy in near-shore regions,<ref>weapon development{{cite web |last= Chu |first= Dr. Peter C. |title= Non-Cylindrical Mine Drop Experiment |url= http://faculty.nps.edu/pcchu/web_paper/proceedings/jcot/midex2.pdf |accessdate= 4 May 2006 |publisher= Seventh International Symposium on Technology and Mine Problem, NPS, Monterey, California, USA }}.  By using high speed digital cameras to record and playback the images in slow motion, the trajectory of a mine entering into the water can be optimized for accuracy by adjusting the shape of the mine and the entry angle into the water.
