It began seven years after the failure of the [[Fifth Crusade]] and involved very little actual fighting. The diplomatic maneuvering of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Sicily]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], resulted in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] regaining some control over Jerusalem for much of the ensuing fifteen years (1229\u20131239, 1241\u20131244)<ref name=\"Boas\" /> as well as over other areas of the Holy Land.\n\n==Frederick II and the Papacy==\n[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], had involved himself broadly in the [[Fifth Crusade]], sending troops from Germany, but he failed to accompany the army directly, despite the encouragement of [[Honorius III]] and later [[Gregory IX]], as he needed to consolidate his position in Germany and Italy before embarking on a [[crusade]]. However, Frederick again :)promised to go on a crusade after his coronation as emperor in 1220 by [[Pope Honorius III]].\n\nIn 1225 Frederick married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem]] (also known as Yolande), daughter of [[John of Brienne]] (nominal ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]) and [[Maria of Montferrat]]. Frederick now had a claim to the truncated kingdom, and reason to attempt to restore it.<ref name=\"war_religion\" /> In 1227, after [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] became [[pope]], Frederick's army set sail from [[Brindisi]] for [[Akko|Acre]] (then the capital of the truncated Kingdom of Jerusalem), but an epidemic forced Frederick to return to [[Italy]]. Gregory took this opportunity to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] Frederick for breaking his crusader vow, though this was just an excuse, as Frederick had for years been trying to consolidate imperial power in Italy at the expense of the [[papacy]].\n\nIn June 1228 Frederick made his last effort to be reconcile with Gregory, sending Archbishop [[Albert I of K\u00e4fernburg|Albert of Magdeburg]] and two Sicilian justiciars to speak with the pope. It had no effect and the excommunicated Frederick sailed from [[Brindisi]] on 28 June. The fleet was under the command of Admiral [[Henry of Malta]] and the archbishops of [[Archbishop of Palermo|Palermo]], [[Archbishop of Reggio|Reggio]], [[Archbishop of Capua|Capua]] and [[Archbishop of Bari|Bari]] accompanied him. He had only a small force with him, since the main force had sailed in August 1227 and reinforcements in April 1228.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 206.</ref>\n\n==The Crusade==\n[[File:Sixi\u00e8me croisade-es.svg|thumb|Map of Sixth Crusade]]\n\n===Stopover in Cyprus===\nThe route of Frederick's fleet can be traced day-by-day. On 29 June it stopped in [[Otranto]], whence it crossed the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the island of [[Othonoi]] on 30 June. It was in [[Corfu]] on 1 July, Porto Guiscardo in [[Cephalonia]] on 2 July, [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] on 4 July, Portocaglie near [[Cape Matapan]] on 5 July, [[Cerigo]] on 6 July and it reached [[Souda Bay]] on [[Crete]] on 7 July. The fleet moved slowly along the Cretan coast, pausing for a whole day at [[Heraklion]] before crossing the [[Aegean Sea]] to [[Rhodes]] during 12\u201315 July. They sailed along the [[Anatolia]]n coast to Phenika, where they stayed on 16\u201317 July replenishing their water supplies. The fleet then crossed the sea to Cyprus, arriving at [[Limassol]] on 21 July.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 207.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] had been an imperial fief since the Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], Frederick's father, had accepted the homage of [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery of Lusignan]] and made him king on the eve of the [[German Crusade]] in 1196.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 213.</ref> The emperor arrived with the clear intent of stamping his authority on the kingdom, but was treated cordially by the native barons until a dispute arose between him and the constable of Cyprus, [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]]. Frederick claimed that his regency was illegitimate and demanded the surrender of John's mainland fief of [[Beirut]] to the imperial throne. Here he erred, for John pointed out that the kingdoms of Cyprus and Jerusalem were constitutionally separate and he could not be punished for offences in Cyprus by seizure of Beirut. This would have important consequences for the crusade, as it alienated the powerful [[House of Ibelin|Ibelin faction]], turning them against the emperor.\n\n===In the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\nAcre, as the nominal capital of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the seat of the [[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchate]], was split in its support for Frederick. Frederick's own army and the [[Teutonic Knights]] supported him, but Patriarch [[Gerald of Lausanne]] (and the clergy) followed the hostile papal line. Once news of Frederick's excommunication had spread, public support for him waned considerably. The position of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Knights Templar]] is more complicated; though they refused to join the emperor's army directly, they supported the crusade once Frederick agreed to have his name removed from official orders. The native barons greeted Frederick enthusiastically at first, but were wary of the emperor's history of centralization and his desire to impose imperial authority. This was largely due to Frederick's treatment of John of Ibelin in Cyprus, and his apparent disdain for the constitutional concerns of the barons.\n\n===Diplomatic agreement with Sultan al-Kamil===\nEven with the military orders on board, Frederick's force was a mere shadow of the army that had amassed when the crusade had originally been called. He realised that his only hope of success in the Holy Land was to negotiate for the surrender of Jerusalem as he lacked the manpower to engage the [[Ayyubid]] empire in battle. Frederick hoped that a token show of force, a threatening march down the coast, would be enough to convince [[al-Kamil]], the [[sultan]] of [[Egypt]], to honor a proposed agreement that had been negotiated some years earlier, prior to the death of [[Al-Mu'azzam|al-Muazzam]], the governor of [[Damascus]]. The Egyptian sultan, occupied with the suppression of rebellious forces in Syria, agreed to cede Jerusalem to the [[Franks]], along with a narrow corridor to the coast.\n\nIn addition, Frederick received [[Nazareth]], [[Sidon]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Bethlehem]]. Other lordships may have been returned to Christian control, but sources disagree. It was, however, a treaty of compromise. The Muslims retained control over the [[Temple Mount]] area of Jerusalem, the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], and the [[Dome of the Rock]]. The [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] castles stayed in Ayyubid hands, and Arab sources suggest that Frederick was not permitted to restore Jerusalem's fortifications, although the Crusaders did in fact restore Jerusalem's defensive walls. The treaty was closed on the 18th of February, 1229, and also involved a 10-year truce.\n\nOne of the results of the treaty was that Jews were once more prohibited from living in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"jewishhistory\" /><ref>My Jerusalem: Essays, Reminiscences, and Poems.
