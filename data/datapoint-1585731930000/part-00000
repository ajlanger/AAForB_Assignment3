Being one of the most sacred temples in India, the Baidyanath Temple holds a spiritual high ground among other temples owing to its religious significance and its architecture.{{or-inline|date=March 2019}} Located in Deoghar in the Santhal Parganas division of the state of Jharkhand in India, this large temple complex comprises the main temple of Baba Baidyanath, where the Jyotirlinga is installed, along with twenty-one other temples.{{fact|date=March 2019}} \nThe temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, the demon Ravana, king of Lanka, worshipped Shiva at this very site, where the temple is currently located. Ravana offered his ten heads one after the other, as a sacrifice to Lord Shiva. Pleased with this act, Shiva proceeded to descend to the Earth to cure Ravana, who was injured. Since Lord Shiva had acted as a doctor, he is referred to as 'Vaidhya', and it is from this aspect of Shiva that the temple derives its name.\n\n2. '''Nandan Pahar'''\nNandan Pahar is an amusement park built on top of a hill in the district of Deoghar in Jharkhand, India. The park attracts visitors from nearby localities from almost all age groups.{{fact|date=March 2019}} \nNandan Pahar consists of a garden, a pond, and serves as an amusement or recreational park with several joy rides within the green garden.{{fact|date=March 2019}} There are theme houses at the park too.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The Nandi temple, which is situated on the top of Nandan Pahar, is very famous in the locality.{{fact|date=March 2019}} Nandan Pahar is managed and promoted by the Jharkhand State Tourism Development Corporation. \n\n3.'''Tapovan Caves and Hills'''\nLocated 10  km from Deoghar, this place has a temple of Shiva called Taponath Mahadeva and several caves are also present there. In one of the caves, there is a Shiva lingam installed and it is said that Sage Valmiki came here for penance.\n\n4.'''Naulakha Mandir'''\nSituated 1.5  km from the main temple, this temple measures 146  ft high and is very similar to the temple of Ramakrishna in Belur. It is dedicated to Radha-Krishna and since its construction cost Rs. 9 lakh, it is also known as Naulakha temple.\n\n5.'''Basukinath Temple'''\nLocated in the Dumka district of Jharkhand on the Deoghar-Dumka state highway, Basukinath is a place of worship for Hindus. Pilgrims visit the temple each year from all parts of the country to worship Lord Shiva, who is the presiding deity. The crowd at the temple drastically increases in the month of Shravan, when not only local and national tourists but also international visitors visit.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt is widely believed that the Basukinath Temple is the court of Baba Bhole Nath. The temples of Shiva and Parvati are located just in front of each other in the Basukinath Temple. The gates of both of these temples open in the evening, and it is believed that Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati meet each other at this time. Thus, devotees are asked to move away from the front gates of the temple. Other small temples that are dedicated to different Gods and Goddesses can also be found inside the compound.\n\n6.Satsang Nagar\n\n7.Rikhiyapith\n\n8.Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith\n\n9.Balanand shram<ref>https://www.holidify.com/places/deoghar/basukinath-sightseeing-1735.html</ref>\n\n===Saawan Mela===\nThe importance of Babadham increases during the month of Shrawan. During this period, lakhs of devotees throng the Baba Baidyanath temple. Most of the tourists first visit Sultanganj, which is 108  km from Babadham.\n\nIn Sultanganj, the Ganges flows to the North. It is from this place that the devotees collect water in their kanwars and carry the holy Ganges water, with the kanwars on their shoulders. They walk 109  km up to Baba Baidyanath temple at Babadham reciting Bol Bam on the way.\n\nOn reaching Babadham, the kanwarias first take a dip in the Shivaganga to purify themselves and then enter the Baba Baidyanath temple, where the Ganges water is offered to the Jyotirlingam.\n\nThis pilgrimage continues during the whole of Shravan for 30 days, from July\u2013August. This is the longest religious fair in the world.\n\nPeople from foreign lands also visit Babadham not only during Shrawan month but also during the rest of the year.\n\nThe sight on the way from Sultanganj to Babadham is of a 109  km long human chain of saffron-clad pilgrims. It is estimated that within this period of one month around 5.0 to 5.5  million pilgrims visit Babadham.\n\nBesides the great pilgrimage of Shrawan, almost the whole year remains under fair with Shivaratri in March, Basant Panchami in January, Bhadra Purnima in September.\nAlso here Rikhiya ashram famous in world{{fact|date=March 2019}} for its meditation camp along with the Ramniwas Ashram of Saint Balanand Brahmachari, Mohan Mandir of Mohananand Swami, Kailash Pahar Ashram-Jasidih of Swami Hansdev Avadhoot.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Temples and Holy places in and around Deoghar District===\n\nAjgaibinath (Ajit),\nBaiju Temple,\nBasukinath,\nDeva Sangha Math,\nDolmanch,\nHarila Jori,\nHathi Pahar or Mahadevatari,\nJain Temple,\nKailash Pahar Ashram,\nKathikund Daninath Shiva Temple,\nKundeshwari,\nJagrat Kunda Kali Mandir,\nLila Temple,\nSeva Nikunj,\nMansarovar,\nNandan Pahar,\nNaulakha Temple,\nPagla Baba Ashram,\nRikhia Ashram,\nRam Krishna Mission Vidyapeeth,\nSatsang Nagar and Ashram,\nShitala Temple,\nShivaganga,\nShiv Mandir Chitra,\nTapovan,\nChitra coalyari (Jamua) \nTrikuta Parvata.\n\n====Other temples====\n*Taapovan.\n* Naulakha Temple, Deoghar\n* Trikuti Pahar, Mohanpur\n* Budhai Mandir, Madhupur\n* Basuki Nath Temple,\n* Pathrol, Kali Mandirw\n* Nayak Dham, Ganjobari Near Joramow Railway Station.\n* Dindakoli [[Durga]] and Shiva mandir\n* Karon [[Shiva]] mandir\n* Dubay baba mandir dakai (sarwan)\n* Masan Baba Temple (With Mahakali and [[Batuk Bhairav]]) - Very auspicious as Deoghar is one of the Chhita Bhumi where it is believed that Lord Shiva comes and applies Bhasm from Chhita\n\n==Education==\nDeoghar College in Deoghar town was founded in 1951.

Being one of the most sacred temples in India, the Baidyanath Temple holds a spiritual high ground among other temples owing to its religious significance and its architecture.{{or-inline|date=March 2019}} Located in Deoghar in the Santhal Parganas division of the state of Jharkhand in India, this large temple complex comprises the main temple of Baba Baidyanath, where the Jyotirlinga is installed, along with twenty-one other temples.{{fact|date=March 2019}} \nThe temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, the demon Ravana, king of Lanka, worshipped Shiva at this very site, where the temple is currently located. Ravana offered his ten heads one after the other, as a sacrifice to Lord Shiva. Pleased with this act, Shiva proceeded to descend to the Earth to cure Ravana, who was injured. Since Lord Shiva had acted as a doctor, he is referred to as 'Vaidhya', and it is from this aspect of Shiva that the temple derives its name.\n\n2.

The crowd at the temple drastically increases in the month of Shravan, when not only local and national tourists but also international visitors visit.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt is widely believed that the Basukinath Temple is the court of Baba Bhole Nath. The temples of Shiva and Parvati are located just in front of each other in the Basukinath Temple. The gates of both of these temples open in the evening, and it is believed that Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati meet each other at this time. Thus, devotees are asked to move away from the front gates of the temple. Other small temples that are dedicated to different Gods and Goddesses can also be found inside the compound.\n\n6.Satsang Nagar\n\n7.Rikhiyapith\n\n8.Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith\n\n9.Balanand shram<ref>https://www.holidify.com/places/deoghar/basukinath-sightseeing-1735.html</ref>\n\n===Saawan Mela===\nThe importance of Babadham increases during the month of Shrawan.

It is from this place that the devotees collect water in their kanwars and carry the holy Ganges water, with the kanwars on their shoulders. They walk 109  km up to Baba Baidyanath temple at Babadham reciting Bol Bam on the way.\n\nOn reaching Babadham, the kanwarias first take a dip in the Shivaganga to purify themselves and then enter the Baba Baidyanath temple, where the Ganges water is offered to the Jyotirlingam.\n\nThis pilgrimage continues during the whole of Shravan for 30 days, from July\u2013August.
