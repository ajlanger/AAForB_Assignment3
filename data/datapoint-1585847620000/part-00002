By the time they recorded their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''Barging Into the Presence of God'' released in 1989, the band went into a direction that displayed a mix of Ian Masters' choirboy-like vocals along with dark atmospheric and noisy pop tunes. Ashley Horner from [[Edsel Auctioneer]] briefly joined the band on guitar in the same year.<ref name=\"Strong\" /> The band was signed to [[4AD Records]] after their first [[London]] [[concert|show]], by the label's chief [[Ivo Watts-Russell]].<ref name=\"Strong\" />\n\nThe group's first album, ''[[The Comforts of Madness (album)|The Comforts of Madness]]'', was released in 1990, and reached the top 40 of the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Strong\" /> The album's tracks were [[record producer|produced]] by [[John Fryer (music)|John Fryer]] and [[Gil Norton]].<ref name=\"Kellman\">Kellman, Andy \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13895/biography|pure_url=yes}} Pale Saints Biography]\", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> The album includes a [[cover version]] of \"Fell From the Sun\" by [[Opal (band)|Opal]].\n\nIn late 1990, Meriel Barham, the original vocalist of [[Lush (band)|Lush]], joined the band as second guitarist and vocalist.<ref name=\"Strong\" /><ref name=\"Kellman\" /> Barham contributed backing vocals and guitars to the ''Half-Life'' EP, then joined permanently for the [[Nancy Sinatra]] [[Cover version|cover]] \"Kinky Love\", which gave the band a [[UK Singles Chart|minor hit single]] as part of ''Flesh Balloon'' EP.

Meriel Barham departed in September 1995 and the group eventually disbanded in 1996.<ref name=\"Kellman\" />\n\n==Post-band projects==\nMasters continues to create music, often of an experimental nature.
