It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones. The Posidonia Shale is considered to be the reference formation for the Lower Toarcian section.<ref>R\u00f6hl, H. J., & Schmid-R\u00f6hl, A. (2005).

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

The first fossils where recovered on several Collections, some since the Modern Age, present on localities like the pits near the Banz Abbey.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.
