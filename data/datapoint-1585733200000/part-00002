Johnson at the ESEA signing ceremony, with his childhood schoolteacher Ms. Kate Deadrich Loney]]\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n\nThe '''Elementary and Secondary Education Act''' ('''ESEA''') was passed by the [[89th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on April 11, 1965. Part of Johnson's \"[[War on Poverty]]\", the act has been the most far-reaching federal legislation affecting education ever passed by the [[United States Congress]].\n\nJohnson proposed a major reform of federal education policy in the aftermath of his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election]], and his proposal quickly led to the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The act provides federal funding to [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], with funds authorized for [[professional development]], instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. The act emphasizes equal access to education, aiming to shorten the [[achievement gap]]s between students by providing federal funding to support schools with children from impoverished families.\n\nSince 1965, ESEA has been modified and reauthorized by Congress several times. The [[Bilingual Education Act]] provides support for [[bilingual education]] and educational efforts for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and other groups. The [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]] prohibits discrimination against students and teachers. The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) introduced a testing regime designed to promote [[standards-based education reform in the United States|standards-based education]]. The [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] retained some of the testing requirements established by the NCLB, but shifted accountability provisions to the states.\n\n==Historical context==\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty.<ref>Bernstein (1996), pp. 183\u2013213.</ref>{{page range too broad|date=May 2019}} Education funding in the 1960s was especially tight due to the demographic challenges posed by the large [[Baby Boomer]] generation, but Congress had repeatedly rejected increased federal financing for public schools.<ref>Zelizer (2015), pp. 174\u2013176.</ref> Buoyed by his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], Johnson sought to dramatically increase federal funding for education at the start of his second term.<ref>Dallek (1998), pp. 195\u2013198.</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1965, President Johnson called for congressional efforts to improve education opportunities for America's children.  Wary of popular fears regarding increased federal involvement in local schools, the Johnson administration advocated giving local districts great leeway to use the new funds, which were to be first distributed as grants to each state.  Shortly thereafter, [[Carl D. Perkins]] (D-KY), the chair of the General Education Subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|House Committee on Education and Labor]] introduced H.R. 2362.  With the Johnson administration's support, and after significant wrangling over the structure of the bill's funding formula committee, the full committee voted 23\u20138 to report it on March 2, 1965.  Following a failed attempt to derail the bill by Representative [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-VA), the House passed H.R. 2362 on March 26, 1965 in a 263\u2013153 roll-call vote.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\">\"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act\" The Legislation, [http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/esea The Great Society Congress]</ref>\n\nAs the Senate prepared to consider the education bill, S. 370, Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to pass it without amendment, in hopes of avoiding the bill to be returned to the House to endure further reconsideration.  S. 370 was assigned to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee]], which subsequently reported the bill to the Senate floor with unanimous support.  During the Senate debates, several amendments were introduced, though none passed. The Senate passed the bill in a 73\u201318 vote on April 7, 1965.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\"/>\n\nPresident Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law two days later on April 9, 1965.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\"/>\n\n==Sections of the original 1965 Act==\n* Title I \u2013 Financial Assistance To Local Educational Agencies For The Education Of Children Of Low-Income Families\n* Title II \u2013 School Library Resources, Textbooks, and other Instructional Materials\n* Title III \u2013 Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students\n* Title IV \u2013 Educational Research And Training\n* Title V \u2013 Grants To Strengthen State Departments Of Education\n* Title VI \u2013 General Provisions\n\nNew Titles Created by Early Amendments to 1965 Law\n\n[[File:United States Department of Education Blue Ribbon School Logo.jpg|thumb|2008 No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School Logo]]\n;1966 amendments (Public Law 89-750)\n* Title VI \u2013 Aid to Handicapped Children (1965 title VI becomes Title VII){{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n;1967 amendments (Public Law 90-247)\n* Title VII \u2013 Bilingual Education Programs (1966 title VII becomes Title VIII)\n\n===Title I===\n{{redirect|Title I|other uses of \"Title I\"|Title I (disambiguation)}}\n\n====Overview====\nTitle I (\"Title One\"), which is a provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act passed in 1965, is a program created by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] to distribute funding to schools and school districts with a high percentage of students from low-income families, with the intention to create programs that will better children who have special needs that without funding could not be properly supported.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Archambault |first1=Francis X. |last2=St. Pierre |first2=Robert |title=Effect of Federal Policy on Services Delivered Through ESEA Title I |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |date=May\u2013June 1980 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=33\u201346 |jstor=1163596 |doi=10.3102/01623737002003033 }}</ref>\nFunding is distributed first to [[State education agency|state educational agencies]] (SEAs) which then allocate funds to local educational agencies (LEA's) which in turn dispense funds to public schools in need.<ref name=\"Source 1\">{{cite web|author=National Center for Education Statistics|title=Fast Facts|url=http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=158|publisher=Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>  Title I also helps children from families that have migrated to the United States and youth from intervention programs who are neglected or at risk of abuse.

Most recently, this legislation includes the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which was passed in 2001.<ref name=\"Source 1\" />\nIn the 2006\u20132007 school year, Title I provided assistance to over 17 million students who range from kindergarten through twelfth grade.<ref name=\"Source 1\" /> The majority of the funds (60%) were given to students between kindergarten through fifth grade.<ref name=\"Source 1\" /> The next highest group that received funding were students in sixth through eighth grade (21%).<ref name=\"Source 1\" /> Finally, 16% of the funds went to students in high school with 3% provided to students in preschool.<ref name=\"Source 1\" />\n\n====Historical context====\nIn its original conception, Title I under the ESEA, was designed by President [[Lyndon B.

but rather they would serve as subsidiary resources.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   These federal regulations, which were focused on financial resources, influenced local Title I programs in many ways.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>  \nPull-out programs were adopted by Title I schools in order to comply with the financial stipulations that were made in the initial reauthorizations.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   These programs separated eligible students from ineligible ones to ensure that those who were in-need would benefit from the program.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   By 1978, in response to the extensive criticism of pull-outs on the grounds that they were asynchronous with the instruction occurring in {{classrooms}}, another option for providing assistance to students was introduced, the school wide approach.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>     Schools with a student body in which the make-up had 100% or more low-income students could use Title I funds for the entire school's improvement rather than for specific individuals.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>  Despite this amendment, local fund requirements prevented all eligible students from using the school wide approach.\n\n=====The 1980s=====\nDuring the Reagan Administration, Congress passed the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) in 1981 to reduce federal regulations of Title I.<ref name=\"Source 6\">{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=M.M|author2=Birman, B.F. |author3=Demaline, R.E. |title=The effectiveness of Chapter 1 services: National assessment of Chapter 1|journal=U.S. Department of Education|year=1986}}</ref> This reflected the administration's stance that resource control should be in the hands of states and local jurisdictions rather than at a federal level.<ref name=\"Source 6\"/> Despite the change outlined by the ECIA and the new designation of Title I as Chapter I, little was done to implement it and traditional Title I practices, like the use of pull-outs, continued.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>\n\nAs the financial regulations became incorporated into practice, the conversation shifted around Title I to student achievement.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   In 1988, the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Act, re-focused Title I on cultivating school improvement and excellent programs.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   The additions that were made through this legislation called for synchrony between Chapter I and classroom instruction, it raised the achievement standard for low-income students by emphasizing advanced skills instead of basic ones and increased parental involvement.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   It also had two new provisions: program improvement and school wide projects.<ref name=\"Source 7\">{{cite journal|title=Chapter 1 Survey of the Hawkins-Stafford School Improvement Amendments.

The IASA attempted to coordinate federal resources and policies with the pre-existing efforts at the state and local levels in order to improve instruction for all students.  This reform made three major changes to Title I.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    It added math and reading/language arts standards to be used to assess student progress and provide accountability.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   It reduced the threshold for schools to implement school-wide programs from 75% poverty to 50% and gave schools a longer reign to use federal funding from multiple programs to dispense funds at a school wide level.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    Lastly, the IASA gave more local control overall so that federal officials and states could waive federal requirements that interfered with school improvements.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>\n\nThe most recent and significant alteration to the original Title I was made by its reauthorization under No Child Left Behind (NCLB).<ref name=\"Source 9\">{{cite web|title=Executive Summary \u2013 Evaluation of Title I Accountability Systems and School Improvement Efforts (TASSIE): First-Year Findings (2004)|url=http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/disadv/tassie1/index.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>   In this reauthorization, NCLB required increased accountability from its schools both from the teachers and from the students.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />   Yearly standardized tests were mandated in order to measure how schools were performing against the achievement bars set by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were also responsible for publishing annual report cards that detailed their student achievement data and demographics.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were now held accountable not only by punitive measures that would be taken if schools fail to meet [[Adequate Yearly Progress|Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)]], but also corrective actions were taken if states did not have an assessment system approved by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Under NCLB, Schools are also required to plan for \u201crestructuring\u201d if they fail to make AYP for three years after being identified for improvement.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  More schools took corrective action under NCLB than under IASA.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />    NCLB also required teachers to be highly qualified if hired using Title I funding.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />\n\nModern applications of the Title I money have been diverse.  Recent uses include wide-scale purchasing of iPads and other Internet using devices as electronic textbooks for students in 1:1 initiatives.  Along with this, students from low-income families often do not have adequate Internet access from home.  Thus, various public money, including Title I funds, are being investigated for possible use to provide cellular Internet access for students to receive remediation or other instructional content from home.  The purpose of 24/7 internet access from home is to close the gap between higher income families where remediation resources are generally more available through parents and additional services and low-income students where such resources are scarce.  Educational Technology advocates have long cited 24/7 Internet access as a boon to the education and advancement of at-risk children.\n\n====Funding====\nUnder NCLB, Title I funding is given to schools where at least 35% of the children in the school attendance area come from low-income families or to schools where 35% of the student population is low-income.<ref name=\"Source 10\">{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Requirements for Schools|url=http://www.greatschools.org/definitions/nclb/nclb.html|publisher=Great Schools}}</ref>    To determine the percentage of low-income families, school districts may select a poverty measure from among the following data sources: (1) the number of children ages 5\u201317 in poverty counted in the most recent census; (2) the number of children eligible for free and reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program; (3) the number of children in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; (4) the number of children eligible to receive Medicaid assistance; or (5) a composite of these data sources.  The district must use the same measure to rank all its school attendance areas. The funds are appropriated for the use of improving academic achievement for students in low-income households.<ref name=\"Source 10\" />\n\nTitle I funding is received by more than 50% of all public schools.<ref name=\"Source 10\" />  NCLB also requires that for funding to be received, all districts and schools must meet adequate yearly progress goals for their student populations and specific demographic subgroups.<ref name=\"Source 10\" />  Non-Title I schools are schools that do not receive federal Title I funds.<ref name=\"Source 10\" />  Although school districts have some freedom in how Title I funding is distributed among schools within a district, Title I requires them to prioritize the highest-poverty schools.<ref name=\"Source 10\" />\n\nThere are 4 distribution formulas under NCLB for Title I funding: Basic Grant, Concentration Grant, Targeted Assistance Grant, and the Education Finance Incentive Grant.<ref name=\"source 11\">{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind Act \u2013 Title I Distribution Formulas|url=http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/no-child-left-behind-act-title-i-distribution-formulas|publisher=New American Foundation|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>   The [http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/no-child-left-behind-act-title-i-distribution-formulas Federal Education Budget Project] details the requirements for each formula extensively.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> All of the grants mentioned above are designed to close the gap in education resources in underserved and funded communities <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Jaekyung |last2=Reeves |first2=Todd |title=Revisiting the Impact of NCLB High-Stakes School Accountability, Capacity, and Resources: State NAEP 1990\u20142009 Reading and Math Achievement Gaps and Trend |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |date=June 2012 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=209\u2013231 |jstor=23254111 |doi=10.3102/0162373711431604 }}</ref>\n\n=====Basic Grant=====\nThe Basic Grant formula provides funding to school districts based on the number of low income children they serve.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> To receive money through this grant, the school district must meet the requirement of having at least 10 poor children and 2% of its students in poverty.<ref name=\"source 11\" />\n\n=====Concentration Grant=====\nThe Concentration Grant formula is similar to the basic grant formula in the regard that funding is given to schools based on the number of low income children they serve.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> In order to receive money through this grant, school districts must meet the requirement of having at least 15% of children in poverty or a total of 6,500 poor children.<ref name=\"source 11\" />\n\n=====Targeted Assistance Grant=====\nThe Targeted Assistance Grant formula allocates more money for each child as the poverty rate in a district increases.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> This means that school districts with more poverty get more money for each poor child than districts with low poverty.<ref name=\"source 11\" />\n\n=====Education Finance Incentive Grant=====\nThe Education Finance Incentive Grant Formula is two-pronged approach.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> Its main intention is to reward schools that expend more state resources on public education and distribute funding in an equitable manner.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> It is also meant to concentrate funds in districts with high poverty that inequitably distribute state and local education funding.<ref name=\"source 11\" /> In states, funding is allocated to school districts in a way similar to the Targeted Assistance Grant formula but the weight of schools in districts with high poverty that inequitably distribute funding is doubled.<ref name=\"source 11\" />\n\nSince 2001, Federal Title I funding has increased by 88%.

However, in 1968 it transformed to the all-encompassing [[Bilingual Education Act]] (BEA). In its original form, the BEA was not explicit in mandating that all school districts provide bilingual education services\u2014it left much room for interpretation by districts. The ruling in [[Lau v.

There is no official language in the U.S., although some states have declared English as their official language. Three states in particular, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, have declared English as their official language. In 1998, California passed [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|Proposition 227]] with the help of sponsor, [[Ron Unz]], essentially ending bilingual education programs in exchange for an English immersion model which values assimilation over multiculturalism. In 2000, Arizona passed the [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|English for Children]] initiative backed, again, by Ron Unz which mirrored California's Proposition 227 in replacing bilingual education programs with English immersion ones.\n\nMany Americans question whether bilingual education programs or English immersion models are the best route to helping students acquire English. The question of whether public education should encourage the development of the native tongue or completely leave that up to the parent is a difficult one. Some point out that California's Proposition 227 is failing the students for simply failing to address both the linguistic and cultural struggles that students face; in 2004, the test results for California public school students showed the achievement gap for English learners widening and the test scores of English learners to be declining across grade levels.<ref>Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm \"Legislation Timeline\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm |date=2011-09-20 }} Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> Scholar [[Stephen Krashen]] maintains that these three states who have taken the harshest anti-bilingual education policies have seen progress that is modest, at best.<ref>Krashen, S., [http://sdkrashen.com/articles/krashen_immersion.pdf \"How Well Are They Doing?

Johnson at the ESEA signing ceremony, with his childhood schoolteacher Ms. Kate Deadrich Loney]]\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n\nThe '''Elementary and Secondary Education Act''' ('''ESEA''') was passed by the [[89th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on April 11, 1965. Part of Johnson's \"[[War on Poverty]]\", the act has been the most far-reaching federal legislation affecting education ever passed by the [[United States Congress]].\n\nJohnson proposed a major reform of federal education policy in the aftermath of his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election]], and his proposal quickly led to the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The act provides federal funding to [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], with funds authorized for [[professional development]], instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. The act emphasizes equal access to education, aiming to shorten the [[achievement gap]]s between students by providing federal funding to support schools with children from impoverished families.\n\nSince 1965, ESEA has been modified and reauthorized by Congress several times. The [[Bilingual Education Act]] provides support for [[bilingual education]] and educational efforts for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and other groups. The [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]] prohibits discrimination against students and teachers. The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) introduced a testing regime designed to promote [[standards-based education reform in the United States|standards-based education]]. The [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] retained some of the testing requirements established by the NCLB, but shifted accountability provisions to the states.\n\n==Historical context==\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty.<ref>Bernstein (1996), pp. 183\u2013213.</ref>{{page range too broad|date=May 2019}} Education funding in the 1960s was especially tight due to the demographic challenges posed by the large [[Baby Boomer]] generation, but Congress had repeatedly rejected increased federal financing for public schools.<ref>Zelizer (2015), pp. 174\u2013176.</ref> Buoyed by his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], Johnson sought to dramatically increase federal funding for education at the start of his second term.<ref>Dallek (1998), pp. 195\u2013198.</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1965, President Johnson called for congressional efforts to improve education opportunities for America's children.  Wary of popular fears regarding increased federal involvement in local schools, the Johnson administration advocated giving local districts great leeway to use the new funds, which were to be first distributed as grants to each state.  Shortly thereafter, [[Carl D. Perkins]] (D-KY), the chair of the General Education Subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|House Committee on Education and Labor]] introduced H.R. 2362.  With the Johnson administration's support, and after significant wrangling over the structure of the bill's funding formula committee, the full committee voted 23\u20138 to report it on March 2, 1965.  Following a failed attempt to derail the bill by Representative [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-VA), the House passed H.R. 2362 on March 26, 1965 in a 263\u2013153 roll-call vote.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\">\"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act\" The Legislation, [http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/esea The Great Society Congress]</ref>\n\nAs the Senate prepared to consider the education bill, S. 370, Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to pass it without amendment, in hopes of avoiding the bill to be returned to the House to endure further reconsideration.  S. 370 was assigned to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee]], which subsequently reported the bill to the Senate floor with unanimous support.  During the Senate debates, several amendments were introduced, though none passed.

The IASA attempted to coordinate federal resources and policies with the pre-existing efforts at the state and local levels in order to improve instruction for all students.  This reform made three major changes to Title I.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    It added math and reading/language arts standards to be used to assess student progress and provide accountability.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   It reduced the threshold for schools to implement school-wide programs from 75% poverty to 50% and gave schools a longer reign to use federal funding from multiple programs to dispense funds at a school wide level.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    Lastly, the IASA gave more local control overall so that federal officials and states could waive federal requirements that interfered with school improvements.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>\n\nThe most recent and significant alteration to the original Title I was made by its reauthorization under No Child Left Behind (NCLB).<ref name=\"Source 9\">{{cite web|title=Executive Summary \u2013 Evaluation of Title I Accountability Systems and School Improvement Efforts (TASSIE): First-Year Findings (2004)|url=http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/disadv/tassie1/index.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>   In this reauthorization, NCLB required increased accountability from its schools both from the teachers and from the students.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />   Yearly standardized tests were mandated in order to measure how schools were performing against the achievement bars set by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were also responsible for publishing annual report cards that detailed their student achievement data and demographics.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were now held accountable not only by punitive measures that would be taken if schools fail to meet [[Adequate Yearly Progress|Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)]], but also corrective actions were taken if states did not have an assessment system approved by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Under NCLB, Schools are also required to plan for \u201crestructuring\u201d if they fail to make AYP for three years after being identified for improvement.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  More schools took corrective action under NCLB than under IASA.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />    NCLB also required teachers to be highly qualified if hired using Title I funding.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />\n\nModern applications of the Title I money have been diverse.  Recent uses include wide-scale purchasing of iPads and other Internet using devices as electronic textbooks for students in 1:1 initiatives.  Along with this, students from low-income families often do not have adequate Internet access from home.  Thus, various public money, including Title I funds, are being investigated for possible use to provide cellular Internet access for students to receive remediation or other instructional content from home.  The purpose of 24/7 internet access from home is to close the gap between higher income families where remediation resources are generally more available through parents and additional services and low-income students where such resources are scarce.  Educational Technology advocates have long cited 24/7 Internet access as a boon to the education and advancement of at-risk children.\n\n====Funding====\nUnder NCLB, Title I funding is given to schools where at least 35% of the children in the school attendance area come from low-income families or to schools where 35% of the student population is low-income.<ref name=\"Source 10\">{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Requirements for Schools|url=http://www.greatschools.org/definitions/nclb/nclb.html|publisher=Great Schools}}</ref>    To determine the percentage of low-income families, school districts may select a poverty measure from among the following data sources: (1) the number of children ages 5\u201317 in poverty counted in the most recent census; (2) the number of children eligible for free and reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program; (3) the number of children in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; (4) the number of children eligible to receive Medicaid assistance; or (5) a composite of these data sources.  The district must use the same measure to rank all its school attendance areas.

Title V states that the government should endorse and support local education reforms that parallel reforms occurring at the state level. Parts of this section also state that the government should support innovative programs that help to improve an educational system. This includes support programs for libraries, scientific research leading to state and local educational agencies to put promising reforms into place, as well as for programs to improve teacher performance.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nTitle V also provides government grants given to educational institutions appropriating money to gifted programs for students, foreign language developers, as well as physical education, the arts, and overall mental health care of children and students.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Title VII===\nAdded during the 1967 reauthorization of ESEA, Title VII introduced a program for [[bilingual education]]. It was championed by Texas Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]] (''Political Education'', Cross 2004). It was originally created to aid Spanish-speaking students. However, in 1968 it transformed to the all-encompassing [[Bilingual Education Act]] (BEA). In its original form, the BEA was not explicit in mandating that all school districts provide bilingual education services\u2014it left much room for interpretation by districts. The ruling in [[Lau v. Nichols]] provided some clarity\u2014specific program goals were established, support centers for bilingual education were created, and what a \u201cbilingual education program\u201d should look like was defined. The courts upheld the language of the BEA as it declared a \u201cbilingual education program\u201d as one providing English instruction in unison with the native language. The idea was to push students to high academic achievement via a program encouraging them to learn English while maintaining the native language.<ref>[http://www.k12academics.com/us-education-legislation/bilingual-education-act \"Bilingual Education Act.\"] K12academics, 2004\u20132011</ref> \"It proposed to cultivate in this child his ancestral pride, to reinforce (not destroy) the language he natively speaks, to cultivate his inherent strengths, to give him the sense of personal identification so essential to social maturation,\" summarizes Professor Cordasco of Montclair State College.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20372531|title = The Bilingual Education Act|journal = The Phi Delta Kappan|volume = 51|issue = 2|page = 75|last1 = Cordasco|first1 = Francesco|date = October 1969}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to programs for bilingual students, Title VII implemented plans to help Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaskan natives be provided opportunities for achieving academic equality.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In late 1967, Congress gave $7.5 million to school districts, scholars, and private research groups who proposed the best programs for improving bilingual education.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 461110|title = Bilingual Problems and Developments in the United States|journal = PMLA|volume = 86|issue = 3|pages = 452\u2013458|last1 = Cannon|first1 = Garland|year = 1971|doi = 10.2307/461110}}</ref> This section of the ESEA promotes the federal government working closely with local educational institutions to ensure that Indian, Hawaiian, and Alaskan students are being aided in getting the same educational experiences as all other students.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> This is achieved through programs that keep cultural values intact and push students to strive for academic excellence.\n\nIt is worth noting that Title VII was replaced in the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, and is now Title III \u201cLanguage Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students.\u201d\n\n==Effects on bilingual education==\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter established the Department of Education which allowed for the Bilingual Education campaign to expand bilingual education programs.<ref name=\"History of Bilingual Education\">Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/historyofbilingualed.htm \"History of Bilingual Education\"] Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> In addition to Carter's efforts, President Clinton also showed his support through the [[Improving America's Schools Act of 1994]].

There is no official language in the U.S., although some states have declared English as their official language. Three states in particular, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, have declared English as their official language. In 1998, California passed [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|Proposition 227]] with the help of sponsor, [[Ron Unz]], essentially ending bilingual education programs in exchange for an English immersion model which values assimilation over multiculturalism. In 2000, Arizona passed the [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|English for Children]] initiative backed, again, by Ron Unz which mirrored California's Proposition 227 in replacing bilingual education programs with English immersion ones.\n\nMany Americans question whether bilingual education programs or English immersion models are the best route to helping students acquire English. The question of whether public education should encourage the development of the native tongue or completely leave that up to the parent is a difficult one. Some point out that California's Proposition 227 is failing the students for simply failing to address both the linguistic and cultural struggles that students face; in 2004, the test results for California public school students showed the achievement gap for English learners widening and the test scores of English learners to be declining across grade levels.<ref>Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm \"Legislation Timeline\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm |date=2011-09-20 }} Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> Scholar [[Stephen Krashen]] maintains that these three states who have taken the harshest anti-bilingual education policies have seen progress that is modest, at best.<ref>Krashen, S., [http://sdkrashen.com/articles/krashen_immersion.pdf \"How Well Are They Doing?
