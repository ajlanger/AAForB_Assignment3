Their secretion is mainly [[mucus|mucous]] in nature and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if there is dry mouth present (see further discussion).<ref name=\"Ten Cate 2008\" /> The minor salivary glands are innervated by the seventh cranial or facial nerve.<ref name=\"Neck 2012, p. 157\"/>\n\n===Von Ebner's glands===\n{{main|Von Ebner's glands}}\n[[Von Ebner's glands]] are glands found in a trough circling the [[circumvallate papillae]] on the dorsal surface of the tongue near the [[terminal sulcus of tongue|terminal sulcus]].

Note that in this regard both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli result in an increase in salivary gland secretions<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Costanzo L | title = Physiology | edition = 3rd | publisher = Saunders Elsevier | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4160-2320-3 }}</ref>, the difference lies on the composition of this saliva, once sympathetic stimulus results particularly in the increase of amilase secretion,  which is produced by serous glands. The sympathetic nervous system also affects salivary gland secretions indirectly by innervating the [[blood vessel]]s that supply the glands, resulting in vasoconstriction through the activation of \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors, lessening the saliva's water content.\n\n===Microanatomy===\nThe gland is internally divided into [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobules]]. [[Blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s enter the glands at the [[hilum (anatomy)|hilum]] and gradually branch out into the lobules.\n\n====Acini====\nSecretory cells are found in a group, or [[acinus]] (plural, acini). Each acinus is located at the terminal part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: [[serous]], [[mucoserous]] and [[mucus|mucous]].<ref name=\"Bath-Balogh_2011\">{{cite book | title = Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy | first1 = Mary | last1 = Bath-Balogh | first2 = Margaret | last2 = Fehrenbach | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Elsevier | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4377-2934-4 | page = 132}}</ref>\n\n====Ducts====\nIn the duct system, the lumina are formed by [[intercalated duct]]s, which in turn join to form [[striated duct]]s. These drain into ducts situated between the lobes of the gland (called [[interlobar duct]]s or secretory ducts). These are found on most major and minor glands (exception may be the sublingual gland).<ref name=\"Bath-Balogh_2011\" />\n\nAll of the human salivary glands terminate in the mouth, where the saliva proceeds to aid in digestion.

These benefits include:\n* Protection\n\nSaliva consists of proteins (for example; mucins) that lubricate and protect both the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Mucins are the principal organic constituents of mucus, the slimy visco-elastic material that coats all mucosal surfaces.<ref name=\"pmid6801238\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabak LA, Levine MJ, Mandel ID, Ellison SA | title = Role of salivary mucins in the protection of the oral cavity | journal = J.

Therefore, people with a slower rate of saliva secretion, combined with a low buffer capacity, have lessened salivary protection against microbes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Comba|first1=Allegra|title=Saliva|url=http://flipper.diff.org/app/items/371|website=flipper e nuvola|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Pellicle formation\nSaliva forms a pellicle on the surface of the tooth to prevent wearing. The film contains mucins and proline-rich glycoprotein from the saliva.\nThe proteins (statherin and proline-rich proteins) within the salivary pellicle inhibit demineralisation and promote remineralisation by attracting calcium ions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Function of Saliva|url=http://cariology.wikifoundry.com/page/Function+of+Saliva|website=Cariology|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Maintenance of tooth integrity\n\nDemineralization occurs when enamel disintegrates due to the presence of acid. When this occurs, the buffering capacity effect of saliva (increases saliva flow rate) inhibits demineralisation. Saliva can then begin to promote the remineralisation of the tooth by strengthening the enamel with calcium and phosphate minerals.<ref>{{cite web|title=6 Ways Saliva Protects Your Teeth|url=https://sunningdaledentalblog.com/2012/07/17/6-ways-saliva-protects-your-teeth/|website=Sunningdale Dental News & Views|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=2012-07-17}}</ref>\n\n* Antimicrobial action\n\nSaliva can prevent microbial growth based on the elements it contains. For example, lactoferrin in saliva binds naturally with iron. Since iron is a major component of bacterial cell walls, removal of iron breaks down the cell wall, which in turn breaks down the bacterium. Antimicrobial peptides such as histatins inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans. Salivary Immunoglobulin A serves to aggregate oral bacteria such as S. mutans and prevent the formation of dental plaque.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=John|title=Immunity in the oral cavity|url=https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/organs-and-tissues/immunity-in-the-oral-cavity|website=British Society for Immunology|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Tissue repair \nSaliva can encourage soft tissue repair by decreasing clotting time and increasing wound contraction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mandel|first1=ID|title=The functions of saliva|journal=Journal of Dental Research|volume=66 Spec No|date=February 1987|issue=66|pages=623\u20137|doi=10.1177/00220345870660S203|pmid=3497964|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n* Digestion\n\nSaliva contains the enzyme amylase, which hydrolyses starch into maltose and dextrin.

[[Blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s enter the glands at the [[hilum (anatomy)|hilum]] and gradually branch out into the lobules.\n\n====Acini====\nSecretory cells are found in a group, or [[acinus]] (plural, acini). Each acinus is located at the terminal part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: [[serous]], [[mucoserous]] and [[mucus|mucous]].<ref name=\"Bath-Balogh_2011\">{{cite book | title = Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy | first1 = Mary | last1 = Bath-Balogh | first2 = Margaret | last2 = Fehrenbach | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Elsevier | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4377-2934-4 | page = 132}}</ref>\n\n====Ducts====\nIn the duct system, the lumina are formed by [[intercalated duct]]s, which in turn join to form [[striated duct]]s.

These benefits include:\n* Protection\n\nSaliva consists of proteins (for example; mucins) that lubricate and protect both the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Mucins are the principal organic constituents of mucus, the slimy visco-elastic material that coats all mucosal surfaces.<ref name=\"pmid6801238\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabak LA, Levine MJ, Mandel ID, Ellison SA | title = Role of salivary mucins in the protection of the oral cavity | journal = J.

Therefore, people with a slower rate of saliva secretion, combined with a low buffer capacity, have lessened salivary protection against microbes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Comba|first1=Allegra|title=Saliva|url=http://flipper.diff.org/app/items/371|website=flipper e nuvola|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Pellicle formation\nSaliva forms a pellicle on the surface of the tooth to prevent wearing. The film contains mucins and proline-rich glycoprotein from the saliva.\nThe proteins (statherin and proline-rich proteins) within the salivary pellicle inhibit demineralisation and promote remineralisation by attracting calcium ions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Function of Saliva|url=http://cariology.wikifoundry.com/page/Function+of+Saliva|website=Cariology|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Maintenance of tooth integrity\n\nDemineralization occurs when enamel disintegrates due to the presence of acid. When this occurs, the buffering capacity effect of saliva (increases saliva flow rate) inhibits demineralisation. Saliva can then begin to promote the remineralisation of the tooth by strengthening the enamel with calcium and phosphate minerals.<ref>{{cite web|title=6 Ways Saliva Protects Your Teeth|url=https://sunningdaledentalblog.com/2012/07/17/6-ways-saliva-protects-your-teeth/|website=Sunningdale Dental News & Views|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=2012-07-17}}</ref>\n\n* Antimicrobial action\n\nSaliva can prevent microbial growth based on the elements it contains. For example, lactoferrin in saliva binds naturally with iron. Since iron is a major component of bacterial cell walls, removal of iron breaks down the cell wall, which in turn breaks down the bacterium. Antimicrobial peptides such as histatins inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans. Salivary Immunoglobulin A serves to aggregate oral bacteria such as S. mutans and prevent the formation of dental plaque.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=John|title=Immunity in the oral cavity|url=https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/organs-and-tissues/immunity-in-the-oral-cavity|website=British Society for Immunology|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Tissue repair \nSaliva can encourage soft tissue repair by decreasing clotting time and increasing wound contraction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mandel|first1=ID|title=The functions of saliva|journal=Journal of Dental Research|volume=66 Spec No|date=February 1987|issue=66|pages=623\u20137|doi=10.1177/00220345870660S203|pmid=3497964|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n* Digestion\n\nSaliva contains the enzyme amylase, which hydrolyses starch into maltose and dextrin.
