The division of the ships was on the basis of two-thirds of the fleet to India, one third to Pakistan.<ref>Bhatia (1977), p. 28: \"Consequent on the partition of the country on 15 August 1947, two thirds of the undivided fleet and associated assets came to India.\"</ref>\n\nThe operational ships of the remaining [[Royal Indian Navy]], minus Pakistan, were initially placed under the command of the Commodore Commanding Indian Naval Squadron (COMINS), later the Rear-Admiral Commanding Indian Naval Squadron (RACINS), whose title was then changed to Flag Officer (Flotilla) Indian Fleet (FOFIF). These appointments were initially held by British officers: Commodore H.N.S.
