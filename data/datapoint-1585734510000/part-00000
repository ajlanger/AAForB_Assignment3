To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to [[risk assessment]] wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for [[seismic risk]], where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from [[Wind engineering|extreme wind]] and to a lesser extent [[Flood risk assessment|flood risk]]. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=J.|date=2007-04-05|title=Physical vulnerability modelling in natural hazard risk assessment|journal=Nat.

In these examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative is a \"multi-hazard\" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11069-012-0294-2 | volume=64 | issue=2 | title=Challenges of analyzing multi-hazard risk: a review | journal=Natural Hazards | pages=1925\u20131958|year = 2012|last1 = Kappes|first1 = Melanie S.| last2=Keiler | first2=Margreth | last3=von Elverfeldt | first3=Kirsten | last4=Glade | first4=Thomas | url=https://boris.unibe.ch/17542/1/Kappes2012_Article_ChallengesOfAnalyzingMulti-haz.pdf }}</ref><ref name=\"Gilletal2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Joel C.|last2=Malamud|first2=Bruce D.|date=December 2014|title=Reviewing and visualizing the interactions of natural hazards|journal=[[Reviews of Geophysics]]|volume=52|issue=4|pages=680\u2013722|bibcode=2014RvGeo..52..680G|doi=10.1002/2013RG000445}}</ref>\n\nMany examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an [[earthquake]] may trigger [[landslides]], whereas a [[wildfire]] may increase the probability of landslides being generated in the future.<ref name=\"Gilletal2014\"/>  A detailed review of such interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of varying likelihood and spatial importance.<ref name=\"Gilletal2014\"/>  There may also be interactions between these natural hazards and [[anthropic]] processes.<ref>http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-3049.pdf</ref>  For example, [[groundwater]] abstraction may trigger [[groundwater-related subsidence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthgwlandsubside.html|title=Land Subsidence|work=USGS Water Science School|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nEffective [[hazard analysis]] in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of [[disaster risk reduction]]) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to [[risk assessment]] wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for [[seismic risk]], where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from [[Wind engineering|extreme wind]] and to a lesser extent [[Flood risk assessment|flood risk]]. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=J.|date=2007-04-05|title=Physical vulnerability modelling in natural hazard risk assessment|journal=Nat.
