In contrast, Facebook Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/us/pdf/2018/02/tnf-new-law-book-feb6-2018.pdf|title=KPMG Report on TCJA|publisher=KPMG|date=February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://hbr.org/ideacast/2017/12/breaking-down-the-new-u-s-corporate-tax-law|title=Breaking Down the New U.S. Corporate Tax Law|magazine=Harvard Business Review|date=December 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = US corporations could be saying goodbye to Ireland|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/us-corporations-could-be-saying-goodbye-to-ireland-1.3359050?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fus-corporations-could-be-saying-goodbye-to-ireland-1.3359050|work=Irish Times|date=January 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to [[GDPR]].<ref name=\"reuters\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-eu-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-to-put-1-5-billion-users-out-of-reach-of-new-eu-privacy-law-idUSKBN1HQ00P|title=Exclusive: Facebook to put 1.5 billion users out of reach of new EU privacy law|date=April 19, 2018|publisher=Reuters News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/19/facebook-moves-15bn-users-out-of-reach-of-new-european-privacy-law|title=Facebook moves 1.5bn users out of reach of new European privacy law|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n===Offices===\nUsers outside of the US and Canada contract with Facebook's Irish subsidiary \"Facebook Ireland Limited\".
