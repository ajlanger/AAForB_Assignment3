Some [[intersex]] people also take this form of therapy, according to their personal needs and preferences.\n\nThe purpose of the therapy is to cause the development of the secondary sex characteristics of the desired [[sex]], such as [[breast]]s and a feminine pattern of [[body hair|hair]], [[fat distribution|fat]], and [[skeletal muscle|muscle]] distribution. It cannot undo many of the changes produced by naturally occurring [[puberty]], which may necessitate [[surgery]] and other treatments to reverse (see [[transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)#Unaffected characteristics|below]]). The medications used for the MTF therapy include [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulator]]s (GnRH modulators).\n\nWhile the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first [[puberty]], developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different gender can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with [[gender dysphoria]], and can help the person to \"pass\" or be seen as the gender they identify with. Introducing exogenous hormones into the body impacts it at every level and many patients report changes in energy levels, mood, appetite, etc. The goal of the therapy is to provide patients with a more satisfying body that is more congruent with their [[gender identity]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Medical uses==\n* To produce [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and/or [[wikt:demasculinization|demasculinization]] in transgender women and [[transfeminine]] [[non-binary]] individuals.\n* To produce feminization and/or demasculinization in intersex people.\n\n==Requirements==\n{{Main|Transgender hormone therapy#Requirements|Transgender hormone therapy#Accessibility}}\n\nMany physicians operate by the [[World Professional Association of Transgender Health]] (WPATH) [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SoC) model and require [[psychotherapy]] and a [[letter of recommendation]] from a [[psychotherapist]] in order for a transgender person to obtain hormone therapy.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Other physicians operate by an [[informed consent]] model and have no requirements for transgender hormone therapy aside from consent.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Medications used in transgender hormone therapy are also sold without a prescription on the [[Internet]] by unregulated [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]], and some transgender women purchase these medications and treat themselves using a [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) or [[self-medication]] approach.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\">{{cite web | last = Branstetter | first = Gillian | title = Sketchy Pharmacies Are Selling Hormones to Transgender People: Burdened by cost and medical discrimination, many people are taking a do-it-yourself approach to transitioning | website = [[The Atlantic]] | date = 31 August 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/diy-hormone-replacement-therapy/498044/}}</ref><ref name=\"Newman2016\">{{cite web | last1 = Newman | first1 = Rosalind | last2 = Jeory | first2 = Ted | title = Fears of 'DIY transitioning' as hormone drugs sold to transgender women without checks | website = [[The Independent]] | date = 16 November 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/female-hormone-drug-transgender-online-pharmacy-progynova-asset-chemist-gmc-cqc-a7403366.html}}</ref> Many transgender individuals discuss and share information on DIY hormone therapy on [[Reddit]] communities such as /r/TransDIY and /r/MtFHRT.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" /><ref name=\"Reddit-TransDIY\">{{cite web | title = r/TransDIY | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/}}</ref><ref name=\"Reddit-MtFHRT\">{{cite web | title = r/MtFHRT | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/MtFHRT/}}</ref> One reason that many transgender people turn to DIY hormone therapy is due to long waiting lists of up to years for standard physician-based hormone therapy in some parts of the world such as the [[United Kingdom]], as well as due to the often high costs of seeing a physician.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" />\n\nThe accessibility of transgender hormone therapy differs throughout the world and throughout individual countries.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" />\n\n==Contraindications==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome medical conditions may be a reason to not to take feminizing hormone therapy because of the harm it could cause to the individual.

The sixth edition of the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]]'s Standards of Care permit it from Tanner stage 2 but do not allow the addition of hormones until age 16, which could be five or more years later.

As a result, [[enzyme inducer|inducer]]s of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], [[rifampin]], [[rifampicin]], and [[St. John's wort]], among others, may decrease circulating levels of these medications and thereby decrease their effects. Conversely, [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[cimetidine]], [[clotrimazole]], [[grapefruit juice]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], and [[ritonavir]], among others, may increase circulating levels of these medications and thereby increase their effects. The concomitant use of a cytochrome P450 inducer or inhibitor with feminizing hormone therapy may necessitate medication dosage adjustments.\n\n==Effects==\nThe spectrum of effects of hormone therapy in transgender women depend on the specific medications and dosages used. In any case, the main effects of hormone therapy in transgender women are [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and [[demasculinization]], and are as follows:\n\n{{Effects of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women}}\n\n===Physical changes===\n\n====Breast development====\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Breast development in a transgender woman.png\n| width1 = 220\n| image2 = Breast development in a transgender woman 2.png\n| width2 = 220\n| footer = Breast development induced by hormone therapy in transgender women.\n<ref name=\"BaggishKarram2011\">{{cite book|author1=Michael S.

Development can take a couple years to nearly a decade for some. However, many transgender women report there is often a \"stall\" in breast growth during transition, or significant [[Breast#Asymmetry|breast asymmetry]]. Transgender women on HRT often experience less breast development than cisgender women (especially if started after young adulthood). For this reason, many seek [[breast augmentation]]. Transgender patients opting for [[breast reduction]] are rare. Shoulder width and the size of the rib cage also play a role in the perceivable size of the breasts; both are usually larger in transgender women, causing the breasts to appear proportionally smaller. Thus, when a transgender woman opts to have breast augmentation, the [[Breast implant|implant]]s used tend to be larger than those used by cisgender women.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nIn [[clinical trial]]s, cisgender women have used [[stem cell]]s from fat to regrow their breasts after [[Mastectomy|mastectomies]].

HRT causes the body to accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, and breasts. (Fat on the hips, thighs, and buttocks has a higher concentration of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and is meant to be used for [[lactation]].) The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nSubcutaneous fat increases in the [[cheek]]s and [[lip]]s, making the face appear rounder, with slightly less emphasis on the [[jaw]] as the lower portion of the cheeks fills in.\n\n====Muscle changes====\nHRT causes a reduction in [[muscle]] [[lean body mass|mass]] and distribution towards female proportions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====Bone/skeletal changes====\nMale-to-female hormone therapy causes the hips to rotate slightly forward because of changes in the [[tendon]]s. Hip discomfort is common.  This can cause a reduction in total body height.\n\nIf estrogen therapy is begun prior to pelvis ossification, which occurs around the age of 25, the pelvic outlet and inlet open slightly. The [[Femur|femora]] also widen, because they are connected to the pelvis. The pelvis retains some masculine characteristics, but the end result of HRT is wider hips than a cisgender man and closer to those of a cisgender woman.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Unaffected characteristics====\nHRT does not reverse bone changes that have already been established by puberty. Consequently, it does not affect height; the length of the arms, legs, hands, and feet; or the width of the [[shoulder]]s and [[rib cage]]. However, details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens, and HRT does prevent such changes from progressing further.\n\nThe width of the hips is not affected in individuals for whom [[Epiphysis|epiphyseal closure]] (fusion and closure of the ends of bones, which prevents any further lengthening) has taken place. This occurs in most people between 18 and 25 years of age. {{citation needed|reason=Supporting evidence for age range required |date=January 2016}} Already-established changes to the shape of the hips cannot be reversed by HRT whether epiphyseal closure has taken place or not.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEstablished changes to the bone structure of the face are also unaffected by HRT.

These changes may be reversed by surgery ([[facial feminization surgery]] and [[tracheal shave]], respectively).\n\nDuring puberty, the voice deepens in [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and becomes more [[vocal resonation|resonant]]. These changes are permanent and are not affected by HRT. [[Voice therapy (transgender)|Voice therapy]] and/or surgery may be used instead to achieve a more female-sounding voice.\n\nFacial hair develops during puberty and is only slightly affected by HRT. It may, however, be eliminated nearly permanently with [[laser hair removal]], or permanently with [[Electrology|electrolysis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Mental changes===\nThe psychological effects of feminizing hormone therapy are harder to define than physical changes.

Some [[intersex]] people also take this form of therapy, according to their personal needs and preferences.\n\nThe purpose of the therapy is to cause the development of the secondary sex characteristics of the desired [[sex]], such as [[breast]]s and a feminine pattern of [[body hair|hair]], [[fat distribution|fat]], and [[skeletal muscle|muscle]] distribution. It cannot undo many of the changes produced by naturally occurring [[puberty]], which may necessitate [[surgery]] and other treatments to reverse (see [[transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)#Unaffected characteristics|below]]). The medications used for the MTF therapy include [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulator]]s (GnRH modulators).\n\nWhile the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first [[puberty]], developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different gender can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with [[gender dysphoria]], and can help the person to \"pass\" or be seen as the gender they identify with. Introducing exogenous hormones into the body impacts it at every level and many patients report changes in energy levels, mood, appetite, etc. The goal of the therapy is to provide patients with a more satisfying body that is more congruent with their [[gender identity]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Medical uses==\n* To produce [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and/or [[wikt:demasculinization|demasculinization]] in transgender women and [[transfeminine]] [[non-binary]] individuals.\n* To produce feminization and/or demasculinization in intersex people.\n\n==Requirements==\n{{Main|Transgender hormone therapy#Requirements|Transgender hormone therapy#Accessibility}}\n\nMany physicians operate by the [[World Professional Association of Transgender Health]] (WPATH) [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SoC) model and require [[psychotherapy]] and a [[letter of recommendation]] from a [[psychotherapist]] in order for a transgender person to obtain hormone therapy.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Other physicians operate by an [[informed consent]] model and have no requirements for transgender hormone therapy aside from consent.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Medications used in transgender hormone therapy are also sold without a prescription on the [[Internet]] by unregulated [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]], and some transgender women purchase these medications and treat themselves using a [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) or [[self-medication]] approach.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\">{{cite web | last = Branstetter | first = Gillian | title = Sketchy Pharmacies Are Selling Hormones to Transgender People: Burdened by cost and medical discrimination, many people are taking a do-it-yourself approach to transitioning | website = [[The Atlantic]] | date = 31 August 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/diy-hormone-replacement-therapy/498044/}}</ref><ref name=\"Newman2016\">{{cite web | last1 = Newman | first1 = Rosalind | last2 = Jeory | first2 = Ted | title = Fears of 'DIY transitioning' as hormone drugs sold to transgender women without checks | website = [[The Independent]] | date = 16 November 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/female-hormone-drug-transgender-online-pharmacy-progynova-asset-chemist-gmc-cqc-a7403366.html}}</ref> Many transgender individuals discuss and share information on DIY hormone therapy on [[Reddit]] communities such as /r/TransDIY and /r/MtFHRT.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" /><ref name=\"Reddit-TransDIY\">{{cite web | title = r/TransDIY | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/}}</ref><ref name=\"Reddit-MtFHRT\">{{cite web | title = r/MtFHRT | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/MtFHRT/}}</ref> One reason that many transgender people turn to DIY hormone therapy is due to long waiting lists of up to years for standard physician-based hormone therapy in some parts of the world such as the [[United Kingdom]], as well as due to the often high costs of seeing a physician.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" />\n\nThe accessibility of transgender hormone therapy differs throughout the world and throughout individual countries.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" />\n\n==Contraindications==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome medical conditions may be a reason to not to take feminizing hormone therapy because of the harm it could cause to the individual.

As a result, [[enzyme inducer|inducer]]s of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], [[rifampin]], [[rifampicin]], and [[St. John's wort]], among others, may decrease circulating levels of these medications and thereby decrease their effects. Conversely, [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[cimetidine]], [[clotrimazole]], [[grapefruit juice]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], and [[ritonavir]], among others, may increase circulating levels of these medications and thereby increase their effects. The concomitant use of a cytochrome P450 inducer or inhibitor with feminizing hormone therapy may necessitate medication dosage adjustments.\n\n==Effects==\nThe spectrum of effects of hormone therapy in transgender women depend on the specific medications and dosages used. In any case, the main effects of hormone therapy in transgender women are [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and [[demasculinization]], and are as follows:\n\n{{Effects of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women}}\n\n===Physical changes===\n\n====Breast development====\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Breast development in a transgender woman.png\n| width1 = 220\n| image2 = Breast development in a transgender woman 2.png\n| width2 = 220\n| footer = Breast development induced by hormone therapy in transgender women.\n<ref name=\"BaggishKarram2011\">{{cite book|author1=Michael S.

Development can take a couple years to nearly a decade for some. However, many transgender women report there is often a \"stall\" in breast growth during transition, or significant [[Breast#Asymmetry|breast asymmetry]]. Transgender women on HRT often experience less breast development than cisgender women (especially if started after young adulthood). For this reason, many seek [[breast augmentation]]. Transgender patients opting for [[breast reduction]] are rare. Shoulder width and the size of the rib cage also play a role in the perceivable size of the breasts; both are usually larger in transgender women, causing the breasts to appear proportionally smaller. Thus, when a transgender woman opts to have breast augmentation, the [[Breast implant|implant]]s used tend to be larger than those used by cisgender women.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nIn [[clinical trial]]s, cisgender women have used [[stem cell]]s from fat to regrow their breasts after [[Mastectomy|mastectomies]].

The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nSubcutaneous fat increases in the [[cheek]]s and [[lip]]s, making the face appear rounder, with slightly less emphasis on the [[jaw]] as the lower portion of the cheeks fills in.\n\n====Muscle changes====\nHRT causes a reduction in [[muscle]] [[lean body mass|mass]] and distribution towards female proportions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====Bone/skeletal changes====\nMale-to-female hormone therapy causes the hips to rotate slightly forward because of changes in the [[tendon]]s. Hip discomfort is common.  This can cause a reduction in total body height.\n\nIf estrogen therapy is begun prior to pelvis ossification, which occurs around the age of 25, the pelvic outlet and inlet open slightly. The [[Femur|femora]] also widen, because they are connected to the pelvis. The pelvis retains some masculine characteristics, but the end result of HRT is wider hips than a cisgender man and closer to those of a cisgender woman.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Unaffected characteristics====\nHRT does not reverse bone changes that have already been established by puberty. Consequently, it does not affect height; the length of the arms, legs, hands, and feet; or the width of the [[shoulder]]s and [[rib cage]]. However, details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens, and HRT does prevent such changes from progressing further.\n\nThe width of the hips is not affected in individuals for whom [[Epiphysis|epiphyseal closure]] (fusion and closure of the ends of bones, which prevents any further lengthening) has taken place. This occurs in most people between 18 and 25 years of age. {{citation needed|reason=Supporting evidence for age range required |date=January 2016}} Already-established changes to the shape of the hips cannot be reversed by HRT whether epiphyseal closure has taken place or not.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEstablished changes to the bone structure of the face are also unaffected by HRT. A significant majority of craniofacial changes occur during [[adolescence]]. Post-adolescent growth is considerably slower and minimal by comparison.<ref name=\"PMPH2012\">{{cite book|title=Peterson's Principles of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gxo8AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1209|year=2012|publisher=PMPH-USA|isbn=978-1-60795-111-7|pages=1209\u2013}}</ref> Also unaffected is the prominence of the [[thyroid cartilage]] ([[Adam's apple]]). These changes may be reversed by surgery ([[facial feminization surgery]] and [[tracheal shave]], respectively).\n\nDuring puberty, the voice deepens in [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and becomes more [[vocal resonation|resonant]]. These changes are permanent and are not affected by HRT. [[Voice therapy (transgender)|Voice therapy]] and/or surgery may be used instead to achieve a more female-sounding voice.\n\nFacial hair develops during puberty and is only slightly affected by HRT. It may, however, be eliminated nearly permanently with [[laser hair removal]], or permanently with [[Electrology|electrolysis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Mental changes===\nThe psychological effects of feminizing hormone therapy are harder to define than physical changes. Because hormone therapy is usually the first physical step taken to transition, the act of beginning it has a significant psychological effect, which is difficult to distinguish from hormonally induced changes.\n\n====Mood changes====\nChanges in mood and well-being occur with hormone therapy in transgender women.<ref name=\"NguyenChavez2018\" />\n\n====Sexual changes====\nSome transgender women report a significant reduction in [[libido]], depending on the dosage of antiandrogens. A small number of post-operative transgender women take low doses of testosterone to boost their libido. Many pre-operative transgender women wait until after reassignment surgery to begin an active sex life. Raising the dosage of estrogen or adding a progestogen raises the libido of some transgender women.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nSpontaneous and morning [[erection]]s decrease significantly in frequency, although some patients who have had an orchiectomy still experience morning erections.

Symptoms of PE include [[chest pain]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[syncope (medicine)|fainting]], and [[palpitations|heart palpitations]], sometimes without leg pain or swelling.\n\nVTE occurs more frequently in the first year of treatment with estrogens.
