efficacy as a [[topical medication]] than via [[systemic administration]] which is typical of antisense drugs.<ref name=Marafini2015rev/>\n\n'''Preclinical Studies of Alicaforsen'''\n\nAlicaforsen was found to selectively inhibit cytokine-induced ICAM-1 expression in a variety of human cells in vitro (1). A murine analogue, ISIS 3082, has been shown to be active in multiple models of inflammation, demonstrating down-regulation of either ICAM-1 message or protein in involved tissue in the endotoxin pneumonitis (2) and the dextran-induced colitis (3) models. Control oligonucleotides failed to show pharmacological activity\n\nIn a phase 1 study, a single intravenous dose of alicaforsen from 0.06 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg and four doses every other day ranging from 0.5 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg was administered over 2 hours, were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Drug-related adverse events observed were dose related, modest ~1.5-fold at the 2-mg/kg dose, and transient (2\u20134 hours after dosing) increases in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and threshold effects on complement C3, but not C5, conversion at the highest doses. (4) Both of these dose-related effects (prolongation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and alternative pathway complement activation) have been observed in monkeys given alicaforsen and a spectrum of other phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides.(5) Alternative pathway complement activation seemed to be mediated by an interaction with the inhibitory protein factor H.(6) The prolongation of aPTT appears to be effected through inhibition of intrinsic tenase complex (factors IXa and VIIIa, phospholipid, and calcium) activity.\n\n'''Clinical Studies of Alicaforsen (ISIS 2302) in Crohn\u2019s Disease'''\n\nThe first clinical trial of a systemic antisense drug in humans and additionally, the first use of an anti-adhesion molecule therapy in human disease was performed using a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized (3:1; alicaforsen to placebo), fixed-dose within patient, and dose-escalation trial(7).  The study was designed to obtain pilot assessment of tolerability, pharmacology, and efficacy of alicaforsen in Crohn's disease. Twenty patients with active, steroid-treated Crohn's disease were randomized (3:1, alicaforsen to placebo) to received alicaforsen over 26 days 13 intravenous infusions of alicaforsen (0.5, 1, or 2&nbsp;mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blinded study. The patients were followed up for 6 months.  At the end of treatment, 47% (7 of 15) of alicaforsen\u2013treated and 20% (1 of 5) of the placebo-treated patients were in remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] < 150). At the end of month 6, 5 of these 7 alicaforsen\u2013treated remitters were still in remission, and a 6th patient had a CDAI of 156. Corticosteroid usage was significantly lower (P = 0.0001) in the alicaforsen\u2013treated patients. These findings were corroborated by significant increases in \u03b27 and \u03b1d bearing CD3+ peripheral blood lymphocytes and by decreases in intestinal mucosal ICAM-1 expression during the treatment period.\n\nA subsequent, pivotal, large study consisting of active (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) 200\u2013350), steroid dependent (prednisone 10\u201340&nbsp;mg) Crohn's patients randomized into three treatment groups: placebo versus Alicaforsen (2&nbsp;mg/kg intravenously three times a week) for two or four weeks was performed (8). Patients were treated in months 1 and 3, with steroid withdrawal attempted by week 10. The primary end point (steroid free remission) was a CDAI <150 off steroids at the end of week 14.  A total of 299 patients were enrolled, with a mean baseline CDAI of 276 and steroid dose of 23&nbsp;mg/day. Rates of steroid free remission were equivalent for the two and four week ISIS 2302 groups (20.2% and 21.2%) and the placebo group (18.8%). At week 14, steroid withdrawal was successful in more alicaforsen patients compared with placebo treated patients (78% v 64%; p=0.032). Steroid free remission was highly correlated with exposure (p=0.0064). Other clinical responses were correlated with exposure, with significant results versus placebo being observed in the highest area under the curve subgroup. CDAI scores decreased by 136 (112) at week 14 versus 52 (107) for placebo (p=0.027) and inflammatory bowel disease score questionnaire improved by 43 (31) versus 15 (36) for placebo (p=0.027)\n\nAlthough the primary outcomes failed to demonstrate efficacy, pharmacodynamic modelling identified a subset of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease in whom the drug worked effectively, based upon CRP levels, CDAI scores and PK.\n\n1.\tBennett, CF, Condon, T, Grimm, S, Chan, H, and Chiang, MY.

efficacy as a [[topical medication]] than via [[systemic administration]] which is typical of antisense drugs.<ref name=Marafini2015rev/>\n\n'''Preclinical Studies of Alicaforsen'''\n\nAlicaforsen was found to selectively inhibit cytokine-induced ICAM-1 expression in a variety of human cells in vitro (1). A murine analogue, ISIS 3082, has been shown to be active in multiple models of inflammation, demonstrating down-regulation of either ICAM-1 message or protein in involved tissue in the endotoxin pneumonitis (2) and the dextran-induced colitis (3) models. Control oligonucleotides failed to show pharmacological activity\n\nIn a phase 1 study, a single intravenous dose of alicaforsen from 0.06 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg and four doses every other day ranging from 0.5 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg was administered over 2 hours, were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Drug-related adverse events observed were dose related, modest ~1.5-fold at the 2-mg/kg dose, and transient (2\u20134 hours after dosing) increases in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and threshold effects on complement C3, but not C5, conversion at the highest doses. (4) Both of these dose-related effects (prolongation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and alternative pathway complement activation) have been observed in monkeys given alicaforsen and a spectrum of other phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides.(5) Alternative pathway complement activation seemed to be mediated by an interaction with the inhibitory protein factor H.(6) The prolongation of aPTT appears to be effected through inhibition of intrinsic tenase complex (factors IXa and VIIIa, phospholipid, and calcium) activity.\n\n'''Clinical Studies of Alicaforsen (ISIS 2302) in Crohn\u2019s Disease'''\n\nThe first clinical trial of a systemic antisense drug in humans and additionally, the first use of an anti-adhesion molecule therapy in human disease was performed using a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized (3:1; alicaforsen to placebo), fixed-dose within patient, and dose-escalation trial(7).  The study was designed to obtain pilot assessment of tolerability, pharmacology, and efficacy of alicaforsen in Crohn's disease. Twenty patients with active, steroid-treated Crohn's disease were randomized (3:1, alicaforsen to placebo) to received alicaforsen over 26 days 13 intravenous infusions of alicaforsen (0.5, 1, or 2&nbsp;mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blinded study. The patients were followed up for 6 months.  At the end of treatment, 47% (7 of 15) of alicaforsen\u2013treated and 20% (1 of 5) of the placebo-treated patients were in remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] < 150). At the end of month 6, 5 of these 7 alicaforsen\u2013treated remitters were still in remission, and a 6th patient had a CDAI of 156. Corticosteroid usage was significantly lower (P = 0.0001) in the alicaforsen\u2013treated patients. These findings were corroborated by significant increases in \u03b27 and \u03b1d bearing CD3+ peripheral blood lymphocytes and by decreases in intestinal mucosal ICAM-1 expression during the treatment period.\n\nA subsequent, pivotal, large study consisting of active (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) 200\u2013350), steroid dependent (prednisone 10\u201340&nbsp;mg) Crohn's patients randomized into three treatment groups: placebo versus Alicaforsen (2&nbsp;mg/kg intravenously three times a week) for two or four weeks was performed (8). Patients were treated in months 1 and 3, with steroid withdrawal attempted by week 10. The primary end point (steroid free remission) was a CDAI <150 off steroids at the end of week 14.  A total of 299 patients were enrolled, with a mean baseline CDAI of 276 and steroid dose of 23&nbsp;mg/day. Rates of steroid free remission were equivalent for the two and four week ISIS 2302 groups (20.2% and 21.2%) and the placebo group (18.8%). At week 14, steroid withdrawal was successful in more alicaforsen patients compared with placebo treated patients (78% v 64%; p=0.032). Steroid free remission was highly correlated with exposure (p=0.0064). Other clinical responses were correlated with exposure, with significant results versus placebo being observed in the highest area under the curve subgroup. CDAI scores decreased by 136 (112) at week 14 versus 52 (107) for placebo (p=0.027) and inflammatory bowel disease score questionnaire improved by 43 (31) versus 15 (36) for placebo (p=0.027)\n\nAlthough the primary outcomes failed to demonstrate efficacy, pharmacodynamic modelling identified a subset of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease in whom the drug worked effectively, based upon CRP levels, CDAI scores and PK.\n\n1.\tBennett, CF, Condon, T, Grimm, S, Chan, H, and Chiang, MY.
