The band's main community and offices are located on the {{convert|312|acre|km2|1}} [[Semiahmoo Indian Reserve]] which is sandwiched between the boundary of [[White Rock, British Columbia]] and the Canada\u2013United States boundary and [[Peace Arch Provincial Park]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Semiahmoo people}}\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1790, Europeans estimated the Semiahmoo population at 300. By 1854, the band's numbers were reduced to 250 due to smallpox and warfare. In 1909 there were 38 band members in British Columbia.  In 1963, the number had reached 28 and then just 25 by 1971.  Between 1996 and 2001, the reserve population dropped 34.5 per cent, from 200 people to 131, and currently they have 98 registered members and 53 members who live on site\n\nThe Semiahmoo remain one of the smallest First Nations in the region with about 74 band members, of whom 40 live on Reserve. In fact, Semiahmoo has more non-Aboriginals living on its reserve than band members. As of 2003, the median age of the Semiahmoo population was 42.5 years: higher than the average for all people living on Indian Reserves in Greater Vancouver (which was 39.2 years).\n\n== Reserve and governance ==\nThe Semiahmoo Reserve was established by the Canadian government in 1887. Renowned [[Haida people|Haida]] artist [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]] currently works from a studio on the reserve.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1996, {{convert|172|acre|km2|1}} or more than half the reserve's area was leased by the band to the Municipality of Surrey for recreational \"parkland\" purposes. The City of White Rock and the City of Surrey both used the land, known as \"Semiahmoo Park\" for [[landfill]] and municipal infrastructure purposes.
