Many of the schools that were not used as shelters were severely damaged by the hurricane, and an estimated 44 schools would never reopen.\n\n[[World Central Kitchen]] chef [[Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s]] begged Keleher to use her power to order schools to open their kitchens and cook for their communities. Unsure if school officials would even receive the message because the internet and telephone service was down on the entire island Keleher posted a message, on her social media accounts, telling school officials they had permission to use school kitchens to provide food for hungry Puerto Ricans, who were struggling to find food in the days following Hurricane Maria. Later, a school administrator explained to Andr\u00e9s that schools were required to do just that by law.<ref name=\"We Fed book\">{{cite book |first=Jos\u00e9|last=Andr\u00e9s| title=We Fed an Island: the True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time| date=22 February 2018|oclc=1057000234}}</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 2017, 33 days after the storm, the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|PRDE]] re-opened 152 schools in the regions of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]]. The department was then able to open more schools, starting on a weekly basis and then on a daily basis. As of November 13, 2017, a total of 755 schools had been re-opened, many of them without power but with running water. Keleher had first estimated that 80% of the schools would be open by mid-November; it turned out that a total of 932 schools (84%) had re-opened by November 16. The PRDE adjusted the school calendar so that students would be able to complete the {{nowrap|2017\u20132018}} [[academic year]].\n\nKeleher argued the hurricane provided Puerto Rico with an opportunity to reform the public school system, citing [[Orleans Parish School Board#Reorganization of school system following Hurricane Katrina|comparable changes in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>{{cite tweet|url=https://twitter.com/SecEducacionPR/status/923724280885661696|last=Keleher|first=Julia|user=SecEducacionPR|number=923724280885661696|title=Sharing info on Katrina as a point of reference; we should not underestimate the damage or the opportunity to create new, better schools|date=26 October 2017}}</ref> On November 8, 2017, [[United States Secretary of Education|US Secretary of Education]], [[Betsy DeVos]], Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, and Secretary Julia Keleher, paid a joint visit to the Loaiza Cordero School in the [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] district of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].
