South of this fault is the Northern Basin, or Caroni [[Syncline]], consisting of [[Tertiary]] [[sedimentary rock]]s [[unconformably]] overlying Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks.

The Los Bajos Fault is a [[wrench fault]], with [[Lower Pliocene]] displacement of 6.51 miles, bordered on the north by the Siparia syncline, and on the south by the Erin syncline.  Finally, the [[Southern Range]] consists of anticlinal folds, including the Rock Dome-Herrera anticline and the Moruga-West Field.  East of this Rock Dome are [[en echelon]] folds containing the Lizard Springs Field.  South of these folds is another fold trend containing the Moruga-East, Guayaguayare, Beach, and Galeota Fields.  South of the Morne Diablo-Quinam Erin Field westward is a strongly folded anticline associated with shale [[diapirism]], which extends west southwestward to the Pedernales Field in southeast Venezuela.
