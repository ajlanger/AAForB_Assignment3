{"title_page": "Relative pronoun", "text_new": " \n\nIn the English language, the following are the most common relative pronouns: which, that, whose, whoever, whomever, who and whom.\n\nIn conjoining a subordinate clause and a main clause, a relative pronoun functions as a subordinating [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]. According to some [[dependency grammar]] theories, a relative pronoun does not simply mark the subordinate (relative) clause but also may be considered to play the role of a noun within that clause. For example, in the relative clause \"that Jack built\" given above, the pronoun \"that\" may be construed to syntactically  function as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb \"built.\" Compare this with \"Jack built the house after he married,\" where the conjunction ''after'' marks the subordinate clause ''after he married'', but does not play the role of any noun within that clause.  \n\nIn relative clauses, relative pronouns take the number (singular or plural) and the person (first, second or third) of its antecedent. \n\nFor more information on the formation and uses of relative clauses\u2014with and without relative pronouns\u2014see [[Relative clause]]. For detailed information about relative clauses and relative pronouns in English, see [[English relative clause]].\n\n==Antecedents==\nThe element in the main clause that the relative pronoun in the relative clause stands for (''house'' in the above example) is the [[Antecedent (grammar)|''antecedent'']] of that pronoun. In most cases the antecedent is a nominal (noun or noun phrase), though the pronoun can also refer to a whole [[proposition]], as in \"The train was late, which annoyed me greatly\", where the antecedent of the relative pronoun ''which'' is the clause \"The train was late\" (the thing that annoyed me was the fact of the train's being late). \n\nIn a [[free relative clause]], a relative pronoun has no antecedent: the relative clause itself plays the role of the co-referring element in the main clause. For example, in \"I like what you did\", ''what'' is a relative pronoun, but without an antecedent. The clause ''what you did'' itself plays the role of a nominal (the object of ''like'') in the main clause. A relative pronoun used this way is sometimes called a '''fused relative pronoun''', since the antecedent appears fused into the pronoun (''what'' in this example can be regarded as a fusion of ''that which'').\n\n==Absence==\nNot all relative clauses contain relative pronouns. Some languages, such as [[Mandarin Chinese]],  do not have relative pronouns at all, and form relative clauses (or their equivalents) [[Relative_clause#Mandarin|by different methods]]. English can also make relative clauses without relative pronouns in some cases. For example, in \"The man you saw yesterday was my uncle\", the relative clause ''you saw yesterday'' contains no relative pronoun. It can be said to have a gap, or [[zero (linguistics)|zero]], in the position of the object of the verb ''saw''.\n\n==Role==\nOther arguments can be relativised using relative pronouns:\n;Subject: ''Hunter is the boy who helped Jessica.''\n;Indirect object: ''Hunter is the boy to whom Jessica gave a gift.''/''Hunter is the boy whom Jessica gave a gift to.''\n;Prepositional complement: ''Jack built the house in which I now live.'' (Similarly with prepositions and prepositional phrases in general, for example, ''These are the walls between which Jack ran.'')\n;Possessor: ''Jack is the boy whose friend built my house.''\n\n==Variant forms==\nIn some languages with [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and noun [[declension]]s\u2014such as [[German language|German]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and [[Latin]]\u2014the relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number, while its [[Grammatical case|case]] indicates its relationship with the verb in the relative or main clause.{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 1999 | pp = 36\u201337}} In some other languages, the relative pronoun is an invariable word.\n\nWords used as relative pronouns often originally had other functions. For example, the English ''which'' is also an [[interrogative word]]. This suggests that relative pronouns might be a fairly late development in many languages.{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 1999 | pp = 16\u201319}} Some languages, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], have no relative pronouns.\n\nIn English, different pronouns are sometimes used if the antecedent is a human being, as opposed to a non-human or an inanimate object (as in ''who'' vs. ''that''). \n:(1)  ''This is a bank.  This bank accepted my identification.''\n:(2)  ''She is a bank teller.

The word ''that'' is used because the bank is a thing; the word ''who'' is used because the teller is a person.
