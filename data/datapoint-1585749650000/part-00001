The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word \"plandovati\" used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means \"odmarati\", and in English means \"to rest\".\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895</ref>. In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century the Hungarian empire started it's career and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two thirds of Hungary, including Banat. After the [[Ottoman]] siege of Vienna the Ottoman empire was slowly driven back again and the history of Plandi\u0161te gets more concrete.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* Pervan is serbian and means first, which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker doesnt't tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it's nothing more than a guess: in German it's common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Huangarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happend to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787)</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got it's present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].

He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1887 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787)</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got it's present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].
