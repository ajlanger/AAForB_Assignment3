Most of the remainder of the church originates from the 14th century. The nave, aisles, transepts and crossing were all built together, between approximately 1329 and 1361 (based on [[heraldic]] evidence).<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Construction materials ===\nThe church is primarily built from [[flint]] and [[rubble]], with rubble and [[ashlar]] dressings. The [[Church porch|porch]] and [[buttress]]es are [[brick]] constructions.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Layout ===\nThe church consists of a [[nave]], [[Aisle#Church architecture|aisles]] and a chancel. The chapel is in the North-east of the church, a [[crossing tower]] with a 2-stair [[turret]]. There are north and south porches. Both the chancel and the chapel are at a lower level than the transepts and crossing, with steps leading down to the east.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Windows ===\nThe West and North transept windows have a [[curvilinear]] design - as did the former south transept window - of 4 [[Window#Lights|lights]] with [[Tracery|cinquefoil]] over. The North aisle has two 3-light windows in brick while the South aisle has two 3-light windows in curvilinearstyle, all in plain [[chamfer]]ed surrounds. In the North chapel, there are two [[Gothic architecture#Lancet arch|lancets]] to the west, and two paired lancets with quatrefoils over to east, while the chancel  has a 3-light Perpendicular window and a 2-light curvilinear window on the south wall. The chancel east window is a 5-light perpendicular window, while the chapel east window is a 4-light perpendicular window. All of the windows possess the original [[Reveal (carpentry)|reveals]], as do all of the doors. The chancel south wall has two blocked window openings: the westernmost one is blocked by the stair turret while the easterly one is cut through by 14th century curvilinear window.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\nThe South Transept window is a work of art by Leonie Seliger, commissioned in 2002, which replaced the original windows which was damaged by [[incendiary bomb]]s in the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/><ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/> The window had been bricked up and concreted over in 1952.<ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/> The money to pay for the new window was raised by the ''[[Stour Music Festival]] Appeal Fund'' in memory of its founder [[Alfred Deller]] and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Festival.<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/><ref name=\"leonieseliger\"/>\n\n=== Doors ===\nThe West door is made of 18th century plank in a 14th-century [[Molding (decorative)|roll-moulded]] surround between two large offset buttresses. The North door is a 17th-century plank with door-width plain metal [[hinge]]s. The South door has been [[plaster]]ed over.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Bays, Piers, Arches, Reveals ===\nThe nave has 4 [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] on moulded bases. The arches are double-chamfered. The crossing piers are a continuation of the nave arcade, although on a slightly larger scale, with crossing arches. All of the piers are made from [[chalk]] blocks. Over the west and the north doors, there are angular 4-centred arches. The [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] to the chancel has 3 round piers, various moulded and undercut [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and 'water-holding' bases. The arches are similar double-chamfered ones as seen in the nave. The same style of arches are also used in the nave, and in the transept crossing arches.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n\n=== Features and Fittings ===\n* [[Holy water stoup]] by north door.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* 13th century [[sedile]] in chancel, with hollow-chamfered and undercut surround. There are attached shafts of uneven height in the [[door jamb]]s, with drip-mould over the jambs.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* To the east of the church, a [[piscina]] with 14th century leaf [[crocket]]s over a 13th-century trefoil, with a small plain [[aumbry]] over it.

This was a dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/><ref name=\"kentchurches\"/>\n* In the North chapel, there is a 14th-century [[Rood screen|wooden screen]], with solid lower panels, and 8-light traceried screens on either side of 4-light double door. This is roll moulded with a hollow chamfered beam on top.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/><ref name=\"kentchurches\"/>\n* In the chancel are 17th-century [[altar rails]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* Several windows contain mediaeval glass.<ref name=\"wyebenefice\"/> [[Stained glass]] shields of the King and Kentish families associated with him form part of the  East window,<ref name=\"kentchurches\"/> along with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and representations of Edward III and Eleanor.<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* The nave contains an octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]].<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n* There are several monuments in the north (\"Moyle\") chapel:<ref name=\"britishlistedbuildings\"/>\n** \"To Amye Clerk (nee Moyle), d.1631\"\n** A marble monument showing a shrouded person lying down, with children at their head and feet.

On 31 May 2012, All Saints' Church held a concert to celebrate Deller's 100th birthday during which [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]] planted a tree in memory of Deller in the churchyard.\n\n== Worship ==\nAll Saints' Church is used for Sunday worship in the summer months (May to October);
