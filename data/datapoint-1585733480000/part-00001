As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
