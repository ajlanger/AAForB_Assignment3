[[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], and on both the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Bristol]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].\n\nThe first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.\n\nToday,{{when|date=August 2019}} Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.<ref name=\"Good Growth for Cities 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government & public sector|work=PwC}}</ref> Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the [[University of Reading]]. Every year it hosts the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]], [[Reading City F.C.]] and [[London Irish]] rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the [[Reading Half Marathon]].\n\nIn 2018, Reading had a population of 230,046<ref name=\"ReadingTown\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/southeastengland/reading/E35001501__reading/|title=Reading (Reading, South East England, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> and the wider [[Reading/Wokingham Urban Area|urban area]] had 337,108 inhabitants,<ref name=\"ReadingUA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/englandua/?cityid=7246|title=United Kingdom: Urban Areas in England - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> while the smaller [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] covered by the '''Borough of Reading''' had 163,203 residents.<ref name=\"ReadingUnitary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/admin/reading/E06000038__reading/|title=Reading (Unitary District, Reading, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> The borough is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|two]] [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|members]], and has been continuously represented there since 1295.

The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading.

Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain.

[[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], and on both the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Bristol]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].\n\nThe first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.\n\nToday,{{when|date=August 2019}} Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.<ref name=\"Good Growth for Cities 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government & public sector|work=PwC}}</ref> Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the [[University of Reading]]. Every year it hosts the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]], [[Reading City F.C.]] and [[London Irish]] rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the [[Reading Half Marathon]].\n\nIn 2018, Reading had a population of 230,046<ref name=\"ReadingTown\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/southeastengland/reading/E35001501__reading/|title=Reading (Reading, South East England, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> and the wider [[Reading/Wokingham Urban Area|urban area]] had 337,108 inhabitants,<ref name=\"ReadingUA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/englandua/?cityid=7246|title=United Kingdom: Urban Areas in England - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> while the smaller [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] covered by the '''Borough of Reading''' had 163,203 residents.<ref name=\"ReadingUnitary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/admin/reading/E06000038__reading/|title=Reading (Unitary District, Reading, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> The borough is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|two]] [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|members]], and has been continuously represented there since 1295. For [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial purposes]], Reading has served as the [[county town]] of Berkshire since 1867, previously sharing this status with [[Abingdon-on-Thames]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Reading, Berkshire}}\n{{see also|Timeline of Reading, Berkshire}}\nReading may date back to the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation of Britain]], possibly as a trading port for [[Calleva Atrebatum]].{{sfn|Lawes Long|1836|p=11\u201313}} However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town came to be known as ''Readingum''. The name probably comes from the ''[[Readingas]]'', an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribe whose name means ''Reada's People'' in [[Old English]],{{sfn|Cameron|1961|p=64}} or less probably the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''Rhydd-Inge'', meaning ''Ford over the River''.<ref name=rbhreading>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/reading.html |title=History of Reading, Berkshire |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2001 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122144845/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/reading.html |archive-date=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In late 870, an army of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] invaded the kingdom of [[Wessex]] and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the [[Battle of Reading (871)|first Battle of Reading]], [[Ethelred of Wessex|King Ethelred]] and his brother [[Alfred the Great]] attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342\u2013364}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of [[Battle Abbey]]. In its 1086 [[Domesday Book]] listing, the town was explicitly described as a [[borough]]. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342\u2013364}} [[Reading Abbey]] was founded in 1121 by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], who is buried within the Abbey grounds.

Historically, the town of Reading was smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old [[ecclesiastical parish]]es of the churches of [[Reading Minster|St Mary]], [[St Laurence's Church, Reading|St Laurence]] and [[St Giles' Church, Reading|St Giles]], or the even smaller pre-19th century borough.{{sfn|Dils|1998}} Today, as well as the town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to civil parishes, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading town area, sometimes referred to as ''Greater Reading'', incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley, Tilehurst and Shinfield.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> This area had a population of 230,046 in 2018, with ONS recognising this definition (the USD) as the town of Reading.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes [[Winnersh]], [[Wokingham]] and [[Crowthorne]].\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest official [[Met Office]] weather station is located at the Reading University Atmospheric Observatory on the [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]], which has recorded atmospheric
