He continued the expansion of the empire that his father had begun, and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions of Europe]] and [[Mongol conquests#East Asia|East Asia]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 74.</ref> Like all of Genghis' primary sons, he participated extensively in conquests in [[China]], [[Iran]], and [[Central Asia]].\n\n==Background==\n\u00d6gedei was the third son of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[B\u00f6rte|B\u00f6rte Ujin]]. He participated in the turbulent events of his father's rise. When \u00d6gedei was 17 years old, Genghis Khan experienced the disastrous defeat of [[Khalakhaljid Sands]] against the army of [[Jamukha]]. \u00d6gedei was heavily wounded and lost on the battlefield.<ref>Secret history of the Mongols, $3, II</ref> His father's adopted brother and companion Borokhula rescued him. Although he was already married, in 1204 his father gave him [[T\u00f6regene]], the wife of a defeated [[Merkit]] chief. The addition of such a wife was not uncommon in [[steppe]] culture.\n\nAfter Genghis was proclaimed Emperor or [[Khagan]] in 1206, ''myangans'' (thousands) of the [[Jalayir]], Besud, [[Suldus]], and [[Khongqatan]] clans were given to him as his [[appanage]]. \u00d6gedei's territory occupied the [[Emil (river)|Emil]] and [[Hobok]] rivers. According to his father's wish, [[Ilugei]], the commander of the Jalayir, became \u00d6gedei's tutor.\n\n\u00d6gedei, along with his brothers, campaigned independently for the first time in November 1211 against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]]. He was sent to ravage the land south through [[Hebei]] and then north through [[Shanxi]] in 1213. \u00d6gedei's force drove the Jin garrison out of the [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], and he rode to the juncture of the [[Xi Xia]], Jin, and Song domains.<ref>Marvin C Whiting ''Imperial Chinese Military History'', p. 355.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Mongol conquest of Eastern Persia]], \u00d6gedei and [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] massacred the residents of [[Otrar]] after a five-month siege in 1219\u201320 and joined [[Jochi]] who was outside the walls of [[Urganch]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 57.</ref> Because Jochi and Chagatai were quarreling over the military strategy, \u00d6gedei was appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the siege of Urganch.<ref>John Powell ''Magill's Guide to Military History: Jap-Pel'', p. 1148.</ref> They captured the city in 1221.

[[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], early 14th century.]]\n\nThe Empress Yisui insisted that [[Genghis Khan]] designate an heir before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in 1219. After the terrible brawl between two elder sons Jochi and Chagatai, they agreed that \u00d6gedei was to be chosen as heir. Genghis confirmed their decision.\n\nGenghis Khan died in 1227, and Jochi had died a year or two earlier. \u00d6gedei's younger brother [[Tolui]] held the regency until 1229. \u00d6gedei was elected supreme khan in 1229, according to the [[kurultai]] held at Kodoe Aral on the [[Kherlen River]] after Genghis' death, although this was never really in doubt as it was Genghis' clear wish that he be succeeded by \u00d6gedei. After ritually declining three times, \u00d6gedei was proclaimed Khagan of the [[Mongols]] on 13 September 1229.<ref>[[Michael Prawdin]], Gerard (INT) Chaliand, ''The Mongol Empire'', p. 237.</ref> Chagatai continued to support his younger brother's claim.\n\nGenghis Khan saw \u00d6gedei as having a courteous and generous character.<ref>The Secret history of the Mongols</ref> His charisma is partially credited for his success in keeping the Empire on his father's path. Thanks mostly to the organization left behind by Genghis Khan, and to the personality of \u00d6gedei, the affairs of the Mongol Empire remained for the most part stable during his reign. \u00d6gedei was a pragmatic man, though he made some mistakes during his reign. \u00d6gedei had no delusions that he was his father's equal as a military commander or organizer and used the abilities of those he found most capable.\n\nNotwithstanding reports of his charisma, \u00d6gedei was criticized by Mongol and Persian chroniclers for a crime he committed in 1237, which according to Persian chroniclers consisted of ordering the rape of four thousand [[Oirats|Oirat]] girls above the age of seven. These girls were then confiscated for \u00d6gedei's harem or given to caravan hostels throughout the Mongol Empire for use as prostitutes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> This move brought the Oirat and their lands under \u00d6gedei's control following the death of \u00d6gedei's sister Checheyigen, who previously controlled Oirat lands.<ref>{{Citation|last=Weatherford, Jack, 1946-|title=The secret history of the Mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|date=2010|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=978-0307407153|oclc=951745549}}, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n== World conquests ==\n\n=== Expansion in the Middle East ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|l1=Mongol conquest of Persia}}\n{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}\n\nAfter destroying the Khwarazmian empire, Genghis Khan was free to move against [[Western Xia]]. In 1226, however, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the last of the Khwarizm monarchs, returned to [[Persia]] to revive the empire lost by his father, [[Muhammad \u2018Ala al-Din II.]] The Mongol forces sent against him in 1227 were defeated at [[Dameghan]]. Another army that marched against Jalal al-Din scored a pyrrhic victory in the vicinity of [[Isfahan]] but was unable to follow up that success.\n\nWith \u00d6gedei's consent to launch a campaign, [[Chormaqan]] left [[Bukhara]] at the head of 30,000 to 50,000 Mongol soldiers.  He occupied Persia and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], two long-standing bases of Khwarazmian support. Crossing the [[Amu Darya River]] in 1230 and entering Khorasan without encountering any opposition, Chormaqan passed through quickly. He left a sizable contingent behind under the command of Dayir Noyan, who had further instructions to invade western [[Afghanistan]]. Chormaqan and the majority of his army then entered the northern section of Persia known as Mazandaran in the autumn of 1230, thus avoiding the mountainous area south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. That region was controlled by the [[Ismailis]].\n\nUpon reaching the city of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], Chormaqan made his winter camp there and dispatched his armies to pacify the rest of northern Persia. In 1231, he led his army southward and quickly captured the cities of [[Qum]] and [[Hamadan]]. From there, he sent armies into the regions of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kirman]], whose rulers quickly submitted, preferring to pay tribute to Mongol overlords rather than having their states ravaged. Meanwhile, further east, Dayir steadily achieved his goals in capturing [[Kabul]], Ghazni, and Zawulistan. With the Mongols already in control of Persia, Jalal al-Din was isolated in Transcaucasia where he was banished. Thus all of Persia was added to the Mongol Empire.\n\n=== The fall of the Jin dynasty ===\n{{See also|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nAt the end of 1230, responding to the Jin's unexpected defeat of the Mongol general Doqulkhu, the Khagan went south to [[Shanxi]] province with [[Tolui]], clearing the area of the Jin forces and taking the city of [[Fengxiang]]. After passing the summer in the north, they again campaigned against the Jin in [[Henan]], cutting through territory of South China to assault the Jin's rear. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|besieged in his capital]] of [[Kaifeng]]. \u00d6gedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals. After taking several cities, the Mongols, with the belated assistance of the [[Song dynasty]], destroyed the Jin with the [[Siege of Caizhou|fall of Caizhou]] in February 1234. However, a viceroy of the Song murdered a Mongol ambassador, and the Song armies recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, [[Luoyang]], and [[Chang'an]], which were now ruled by the Mongols.\n\nIn addition to the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|war with the Jin dynasty]], \u00d6gedei crushed the [[Eastern Xia]] founded by [[Puxian Wannu]] in 1233, pacifying southern [[Manchuria]]. \u00d6gedei subdued the [[Tungusic peoples|Water Tatars]] in the northern part of the region and suppressed their rebellion in 1237.\n\n=== Conquest of Georgia and Armenia ===\n[[File:Geor tamro aandersen.png|250px|thumb|\u00d6gedei conquered the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia}}\n\nThe Mongols under Chormaqan returned to the [[Caucasus]] in 1232. The walls of [[Ganjak]] were breached by [[catapult]] and [[battering ram]] in 1235. The Mongols eventually withdrew after the citizens of [[Irbil]] agreed to send a yearly tribute to the court of the khagan. Chormaqan waited until 1238, when the force of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] was also active in the north Caucasus.<ref>Timothy May-Mongol Empire: Chormaquan and the Mongol Conquest of the Middle East</ref> After subduing [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenia]], Chormaqan took [[Tiflis]]. In 1238, the Mongols captured [[Lorhe]] whose ruler, [[Shahanshah]], fled with his family before the Mongols arrived, leaving the rich city to its fate. After putting up a spirited defense at [[Hohanaberd]], the city's ruler, [[Hasan Jalal]], submitted to the Mongols. Another column then advanced against Gaian, ruled by Prince Avak. The Mongol commander Tokhta ruled out a direct assault and had his men construct a wall around the city, and Avak soon surrendered. By 1240, Chormaqan had completed the conquest of [[Transcaucasia]], forcing the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] nobles to surrender.\n\n=== Invasion of Korea ===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Korea}}\nIn 1224, a Mongol envoy was killed in obscure circumstances and Korea stopped paying [[tribute]].<ref>Michel Ho\u00e0ng, Ingrid Cranfield ''Genghis Khan'', p. 159.</ref> \u00d6gedei dispatched [[Saritai]] to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to [[Mongol invasions of Korea|invade Korea]] in order to subdue the kingdom. The [[Goryeo]] King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept [[darughachi|Mongol overseers]]. When they withdrew for the summer, however, [[Choe U]] moved the capital from [[Kaesong]] to [[Ganghwa Island|Ganghwa]] Island. Saritai was hit with a stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them.\n\n\u00d6gedei announced plans for the conquest of the [[Koreans]], the [[Southern Song]], the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]]s and their European allies, all of whom killed Mongol [[diplomat|envoy]]s, at the kurultai in Mongolia in 1234. \u00d6gedei appointed Danqu commander of the Mongol army and made Bog Wong, a defected Korean general, governor of 40 cities with their subjects. When the court of Goryeo sued for peace in 1238, \u00d6gedei demanded that the king of Goryeo appear before him in person. The Goryeo king finally sent his relative Yeong Nong-gun Sung with ten noble boys to [[Mongolia]] as [[hostage]]s, temporarily ending the war in 1241.<ref>J.Bor ''Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, vol.II'', p. 197.</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Capture of the Mongol-Tatars Russian city.jpg|230px|thumb|The Mongol army captures a [[Rus' people|Rus']] city]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\n\nThe Mongol Empire expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]] to subdue the Russian steppe and drive into Europe. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal, and [[Principality of Minsk|Minsk]], which became part of [[Lithuania]]), Hungary, Poland, Serbia and Bulgaria. During the siege of [[Kolomna]], the Khagan's half brother Khulgen<ref>He was the son of Genghis Khan by Khulan khatun of the Merkid clan.</ref> was killed by an arrow.\n\nAfter the conquest of [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Alania]], and the Rus' principalities, \u00d6gedei's son [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] and Chagatai's grandson [[B\u00fcri]] ridiculed Batu, and the Mongol camp suffered dissension. The Khagan harshly criticized G\u00fcy\u00fck: \"You broke the spirit of every man in your army...Do you think that the Russians surrendered because of how mean you were to your own men?\". He then sent G\u00fcy\u00fck back to continue the conquest of Europe. G\u00fcy\u00fck and another of \u00d6gedei's sons, [[Kadan]], attacked [[Transylvania]] and Poland, respectively.\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan had granted permission to invade the remainder of Europe, all the way to the \"Great Sea\", the Atlantic Ocean; his death prevented the invasions from continuing west, as Batu withdrew to participate in the election of a successor.\n\n=== Conflict with Song China ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}\n\nIn a series of razzias from 1235 to 1245, the Mongols commanded by \u00d6gedei's sons penetrated deep into the Song Dynasty and reached [[Chengdu]], [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and [[Yangtze River]]. But they could not succeed in completing their conquest due to climate and the number of Song troops, and \u00d6gedei's son Khochu died in the process. In 1240, \u00d6gedei's other son [[Khuden]] dispatched a subsidiary expedition to [[Tibet]]. The situation between the two nations worsened when Song officers murdered \u00d6gedei's envoys headed by Selmus.<ref>Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States'', p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe Mongol expansion throughout the Asian continent under the leadership of \u00d6gedei helped bring political stability and re-establish the [[Silk Road]], the primary trading route between East and West.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of India}}\n\n\u00d6gedei appointed Dayir commander of Ghazni and Menggetu commander in [[Qonduz]]. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the [[Indus valley]] and besieged [[Lahore]], which was controlled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. However, Dayir died storming the town, on 30 December 1241, and the Mongols butchered the town before withdrawing from the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref>Islamic Culture Board ''Islamic culture'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nSome time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded [[Kashmir]], stationing a [[darughachi]] there for several years. Soon Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency.<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p. 84.</ref> Around the same time, a Kashmiri [[Buddhist]] master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of \u00d6gedei.\n\n== Administration ==\n\u00d6gedei began the bureaucratization of Mongol administration. Three divisions constituted his administration: \n* the [[Christians|Christian]] eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], represented by Chinqai, the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[scribe]], and the [[Keraites]].\n* the Islamic cycle, represented by two [[Khorazm]]ians, Mahumud Yalavach, and Masud Beg.\n*the [[North Chinese]] [[Confucian]] circle, represented by [[Yelu Chucai]], a [[Khitan people|Khitan]], and Nianhe Zhong-shan, a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]].\n\nMahamud Yalavach promoted a system in which the government would delegate tax collection to [[tax farmer]]s who collect payments in silver. Yelu Chucai encouraged \u00d6gedei to institute a traditional Chinese system of government, with taxation in the hands of government agents and payment in a government issued currency. The Muslim merchants, working with capital supplied by the Mongol aristocrats, [[loan]]ed at higher [[interest rate|interest]] the silver needed for tax payments. At the same time the Mongols began circulating [[paper currency]] backed by silver reserves.\n\n[[File:Ogedei qaghan.svg|thumb|left|40px|''\u00d6gedei Khan'' in traditional [[Mongolian script]]]]\n\n\u00d6gedei abolished the branch departments of state affairs and divided the areas of Mongol-ruled China into ten routes according to the suggestion of Yel\u00fc Chucai. He also divided the empire into [[Beshbalik]] and [[Yanjing]] administration, while the headquarters in Karakorum directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Siberia. Late in his reign, [[Amu Darya]] administration was established. [[Turkestan]] was administered by Mahamud Yalavach, while Yelu Chucai administered North China from 1229 to 1240. \u00d6gedei appointed [[Shigi Khutugh]] chief judge in China. In [[Iran]], \u00d6gedei appointed first Chin-temur, a [[Kara-kitai]], and then [[Korguz]], an Uyghur who proved to be honest administrator. Later, some of Yelu Chucai's duties were transferred to Mahamud Yalavach and taxes were handed over to Abd-ur-Rahman, who promised to double the annual payments of silver.<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 102.</ref> The Ortoq or partner merchants lent \u00d6gedei's money at exorbitant rates of interest to the peasants, though \u00d6gedei banned considerably higher rates. Despite it proving profitable, many people fled their homes to avoid the tax collectors and their strong-arm gangs.\n\n\u00d6gedei had imperial princes tutored by the Christian scribe Qadaq and the [[Taoist]] priest Li Zhichang and built schools and an academy. \u00d6gedei Khan also decreed to issue paper currency backed by [[silk]] reserves and founded a Department responsible for destroying old notes. Yelu Chucai protested to \u00d6gedei that his large-scale distribution of [[appanage]]s in Iran, [[Western China|Western]] and North China, and Khorazm could lead to a disintegration of the Empire.<ref>Chunjiang Fu, Asiapac Editorial, Liping Yang ''Chinese History'', p. 148.</ref> \u00d6gedei thus decreed that the Mongol nobles could appoint overseers in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes.\n\nThe Khagan proclaimed the Great [[Yassa]] as an integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father's commands and ordinances, while adding his own. \u00d6gedei codified rules of dress and conduct during the kurultais. Throughout the Empire, in 1234, he created postroad stations ([[Yam (route)|Yam]]) with a permanent staff who would supply post riders' needs.<ref>Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach ''Medieval Islamic Civilization'', p. 632.</ref> Relay stations were set up every 25 miles and the yam staff supplied remounts to the envoys and served specified rations. The attached households were exempt from other taxes, but they had to pay a qubchuri tax to supply the goods. \u00d6gedei ordered Chagatai and Batu to control their yams separately. The Khagan prohibited the nobility from issuing [[paiza]]s (tablets that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations) and [[jarliq]]s. \u00d6gedei decreed that within decimal units one out of every 100 [[sheep]] of the well-off should be levied for the poor of the unit, and that one sheep and one mare from every herd should be forwarded to form a [[herd]] for the imperial table.<ref>Mongolia Society \u2013 Occasional Papers \u2013 p. 17.</ref>\n\n== Karakorum ==\n[[File:Karakorum - Tortue Sud.jpg|thumb|[[Bixi (tortoise)|Stone tortoise]] of Karakorum]]\n{{Main|Karakorum}}\n\nFrom 1235\u201338 \u00d6gedei constructed a series of palaces and [[pavilion]]s at stopping places in his annual [[nomad]]ic route through central Mongolia. The first palace Wanangong was constructed by North Chinese artisans. The Emperor urged his relatives build residences nearby and settled the deported craftsmen from China near the site. The construction of the city, [[Karakorum]] (\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c), was finished in 1235, assigning different quarters to Islamic and North Chinese craftsmen, who competed to win \u00d6gedei's favor. Earthen walls with 4 gates surrounded the city. Attached were private apartments, while in front of stood a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] bearing an engraved pillar, like those that were commonly used in East Asia. There was a castle with doors like the gates of the garden and a series of lakes where many water fowl gathered. \u00d6gedei erected several houses of worship for his Buddhist, Muslim, Taoist, and Christian followers. In the Chinese ward, there was a Confucian temple where Yelu Chucai used to create or regulate a calendar on the Chinese model.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:\u00d6gedei Khan Statue.JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of \u00d6gedei Khan in Mongolia]]\n\n\u00d6gedei was considered to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force of his personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.{{Citation needed|reason=many Reliable Sources exist-the editor should have referenced!|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe sudden death of [[Tolui]] in 1232 seems to have affected \u00d6gedei deeply. According to some sources, Tolui sacrificed his own life, accepting a poisoned drink in shamanist ritual in order to save \u00d6gedei who was suffering from illness.<ref>Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Rudi Paul Lindner, Valentin Aleksandrovich ''The Uralic and Altaic Series'', p. 176.</ref> Other sources say \u00d6gedei orchestrated Tolui's death with the help of shamans who drugged the alcoholic Tolui.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=92|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\n\u00d6gedei was well known for his [[alcoholism]]. Chagatai entrusted an official to watch his habit, but \u00d6gedei managed to drink anyway.  It is commonly told that \u00d6gedei did so by vowing to reduce the number of cups he drank a day then having cups twice the size created for his personal use. When he died at dawn on 11 December 1241, after a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman, the people blamed the sister of Tolui's widow and Abd-ur-Rahman. The Mongol aristocrats recognized, however, that the Khagan's own lack of self-control had killed him.\n\n\u00d6gedei was also known to be a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a [[dictator]].<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 104.</ref> Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to establish a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was a pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.\n\nHowever, Mongol and Persian chroniclers criticize \u00d6gedei for a crime he committed in 1237 which violated the laws of his father, Genghis Khan, which forbade seizure, rape, kidnapping, bartering, or selling young girls, who were allowed to be married at a young age but could not engage in sexual activity until the age of sixteen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> Mongol chronicles were vague about the nature of the crime, but Persian chroniclers indicated that after the Oirat did not send girls for \u00d6gedei's harem, \u00d6gedei had four thousand Oirat girls above the age of seven stripped naked and raped by his soldiers repeatedly in full sight of the girls' relatives. Two of these girls died from the ordeal, and the remaining non-raped were divided up by soldiers, with some being sent to the royal harem, and others assigned to caravan hostels for sexual servitude, and others not deemed suitable for this were left present for anyone to carry them away or use them for any purposes deemed fit. \u00d6gedei seems not to have done this out of sexual depravity as such, but more to consolidate power over the Oirat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\nThe above account, including the assumption that Mongol sources criticized the crime (still questionable), was described in Jack Weatherford's 2011 book ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire''. Weatherford calls it \"the most horrendous crime of his twelve-year reign and one of the worst Mongol atrocities recorded\". A more recent book in feminist historiography \"Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire\" (2018) by Anne F. Broadbridge links the \"infamous alleged mass rape of Oirat girls\" to \u00d6gedei's requisitioning of girls from his uncle Tem\u00fcge Otchigin's territories without Tem\u00fcge's approval.

In Chapter 32 Juvayni starts by praising \u00d6gedei Khan then proceeds to give 50 highly detailed anecdotes to illustrate \u00d6gedei's \"clemency, forgiveness, justice and generosity\" followed by one anecdote to illustrate his \"violence, severity, fury and awesomeness\" which was the rape incident. This anecdote closes the chapter. The name of the tribe is unclear in two manuscripts of Juvayni but Manuscript D and Rashid-Al-Din give it as Oirat. Broadbridge and De Rachewiltz questioned the factual accuracy of this identification with the Oirats.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broadbridge |first1=Anne F. |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |page=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032\u20131035}}</ref> The anecdotes are written in the style of a Persian tale.

This anecdote contradicts the standard account of \u00d6gedei's death from a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman. A number of anecdotes evince a tone of ridicule for \u00d6gedei's lack of self-control. While the anecdotes may contain a kernel of truth some seem to be apocryphal legends originating from the community of Muslim merchants and should be approached with a degree of caution. Another Persian account was the mass sodomy against soldiers of the Jin Dynasty quoted in Rashid-Al-Din and noted by Weatherford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref> Homosexuality was taboo among the Mongols and punishable by death, so the factual accuracy of this \"act of the people of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]\" (Rashid-Al-Din) is still debatable. While Juvayni is a valuable source of information about the Mongol Empire his writings are commonly inflated, as when he estimates the strength of the Mongol army at 700,000, against other accounts that put the number between 105,000 and 130,000. Biased readings of Juvayni's account and projection of modern sensitivities backward in time has also led to the popular but unfounded theory that \u00d6gedei's wife T\u00f6regene and Fatima were in fact lesbian lovers. It is also notable that when Juvayni started writing the [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]] in Karakorum in the year 1252 the \u00d6gedeid faction had been purged by [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] so anti-\u00d6gedei bias could have been widespread.\n\n==Aftermath of \u00d6gedei's death==\n\n\u00d6gedei had nominated his grandson Shiremun as his heir, but G\u00fcy\u00fck eventually succeeded him after the five-year regency of his widow [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]]. However, Batu, the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] (also known as the Kipchak Khanate or the Ulus of Jochi) only nominally accepted G\u00fcy\u00fck, who died on the way to confront Batu. It was not until 1255, well into the reign of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], that Batu felt secure enough to again prepare to invade Europe. He died before his plans could be implemented.\n\nWhen [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271, he had \u00d6gedei Khan placed on the official record as Taizong ({{zh|\u592a\u5b97|T\u00e0iz\u014dng}}).\n\n== Spouses and children ==\nLike his father Genghis Khan, \u00d6gedei had many wives and concubines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rash\u012bd al-D\u012bn \u1e6cab\u012bb, 1247-1318.|title=The successors of Genghis Khan.|date=1971|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-03351-6|location=New York|pages=620|oclc=160563}}</ref> \u00d6gedei married first [[Boraqchin (wife of \u00d6gedei)|Boraqchin]] and then [[T\u00f6regene Khatun|T\u00f6regene]].

Although he was already married, in 1204 his father gave him [[T\u00f6regene]], the wife of a defeated [[Merkit]] chief. The addition of such a wife was not uncommon in [[steppe]] culture.\n\nAfter Genghis was proclaimed Emperor or [[Khagan]] in 1206, ''myangans'' (thousands) of the [[Jalayir]], Besud, [[Suldus]], and [[Khongqatan]] clans were given to him as his [[appanage]]. \u00d6gedei's territory occupied the [[Emil (river)|Emil]] and [[Hobok]] rivers. According to his father's wish, [[Ilugei]], the commander of the Jalayir, became \u00d6gedei's tutor.\n\n\u00d6gedei, along with his brothers, campaigned independently for the first time in November 1211 against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]]. He was sent to ravage the land south through [[Hebei]] and then north through [[Shanxi]] in 1213. \u00d6gedei's force drove the Jin garrison out of the [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], and he rode to the juncture of the [[Xi Xia]], Jin, and Song domains.<ref>Marvin C Whiting ''Imperial Chinese Military History'', p. 355.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Mongol conquest of Eastern Persia]], \u00d6gedei and [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] massacred the residents of [[Otrar]] after a five-month siege in 1219\u201320 and joined [[Jochi]] who was outside the walls of [[Urganch]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 57.</ref> Because Jochi and Chagatai were quarreling over the military strategy, \u00d6gedei was appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the siege of Urganch.<ref>John Powell ''Magill's Guide to Military History: Jap-Pel'', p. 1148.</ref> They captured the city in 1221.

Thanks mostly to the organization left behind by Genghis Khan, and to the personality of \u00d6gedei, the affairs of the Mongol Empire remained for the most part stable during his reign. \u00d6gedei was a pragmatic man, though he made some mistakes during his reign. \u00d6gedei had no delusions that he was his father's equal as a military commander or organizer and used the abilities of those he found most capable.\n\nNotwithstanding reports of his charisma, \u00d6gedei was criticized by Mongol and Persian chroniclers for a crime he committed in 1237, which according to Persian chroniclers consisted of ordering the rape of four thousand [[Oirats|Oirat]] girls above the age of seven. These girls were then confiscated for \u00d6gedei's harem or given to caravan hostels throughout the Mongol Empire for use as prostitutes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> This move brought the Oirat and their lands under \u00d6gedei's control following the death of \u00d6gedei's sister Checheyigen, who previously controlled Oirat lands.<ref>{{Citation|last=Weatherford, Jack, 1946-|title=The secret history of the Mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|date=2010|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=978-0307407153|oclc=951745549}}, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n== World conquests ==\n\n=== Expansion in the Middle East ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|l1=Mongol conquest of Persia}}\n{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}\n\nAfter destroying the Khwarazmian empire, Genghis Khan was free to move against [[Western Xia]]. In 1226, however, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the last of the Khwarizm monarchs, returned to [[Persia]] to revive the empire lost by his father, [[Muhammad \u2018Ala al-Din II.]] The Mongol forces sent against him in 1227 were defeated at [[Dameghan]]. Another army that marched against Jalal al-Din scored a pyrrhic victory in the vicinity of [[Isfahan]] but was unable to follow up that success.\n\nWith \u00d6gedei's consent to launch a campaign, [[Chormaqan]] left [[Bukhara]] at the head of 30,000 to 50,000 Mongol soldiers.  He occupied Persia and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], two long-standing bases of Khwarazmian support. Crossing the [[Amu Darya River]] in 1230 and entering Khorasan without encountering any opposition, Chormaqan passed through quickly. He left a sizable contingent behind under the command of Dayir Noyan, who had further instructions to invade western [[Afghanistan]]. Chormaqan and the majority of his army then entered the northern section of Persia known as Mazandaran in the autumn of 1230, thus avoiding the mountainous area south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. That region was controlled by the [[Ismailis]].\n\nUpon reaching the city of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], Chormaqan made his winter camp there and dispatched his armies to pacify the rest of northern Persia. In 1231, he led his army southward and quickly captured the cities of [[Qum]] and [[Hamadan]]. From there, he sent armies into the regions of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kirman]], whose rulers quickly submitted, preferring to pay tribute to Mongol overlords rather than having their states ravaged. Meanwhile, further east, Dayir steadily achieved his goals in capturing [[Kabul]], Ghazni, and Zawulistan. With the Mongols already in control of Persia, Jalal al-Din was isolated in Transcaucasia where he was banished. Thus all of Persia was added to the Mongol Empire.\n\n=== The fall of the Jin dynasty ===\n{{See also|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nAt the end of 1230, responding to the Jin's unexpected defeat of the Mongol general Doqulkhu, the Khagan went south to [[Shanxi]] province with [[Tolui]], clearing the area of the Jin forces and taking the city of [[Fengxiang]]. After passing the summer in the north, they again campaigned against the Jin in [[Henan]], cutting through territory of South China to assault the Jin's rear. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|besieged in his capital]] of [[Kaifeng]]. \u00d6gedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals. After taking several cities, the Mongols, with the belated assistance of the [[Song dynasty]], destroyed the Jin with the [[Siege of Caizhou|fall of Caizhou]] in February 1234. However, a viceroy of the Song murdered a Mongol ambassador, and the Song armies recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, [[Luoyang]], and [[Chang'an]], which were now ruled by the Mongols.\n\nIn addition to the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|war with the Jin dynasty]], \u00d6gedei crushed the [[Eastern Xia]] founded by [[Puxian Wannu]] in 1233, pacifying southern [[Manchuria]]. \u00d6gedei subdued the [[Tungusic peoples|Water Tatars]] in the northern part of the region and suppressed their rebellion in 1237.\n\n=== Conquest of Georgia and Armenia ===\n[[File:Geor tamro aandersen.png|250px|thumb|\u00d6gedei conquered the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia}}\n\nThe Mongols under Chormaqan returned to the [[Caucasus]] in 1232. The walls of [[Ganjak]] were breached by [[catapult]] and [[battering ram]] in 1235. The Mongols eventually withdrew after the citizens of [[Irbil]] agreed to send a yearly tribute to the court of the khagan. Chormaqan waited until 1238, when the force of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] was also active in the north Caucasus.<ref>Timothy May-Mongol Empire: Chormaquan and the Mongol Conquest of the Middle East</ref> After subduing [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenia]], Chormaqan took [[Tiflis]]. In 1238, the Mongols captured [[Lorhe]] whose ruler, [[Shahanshah]], fled with his family before the Mongols arrived, leaving the rich city to its fate. After putting up a spirited defense at [[Hohanaberd]], the city's ruler, [[Hasan Jalal]], submitted to the Mongols. Another column then advanced against Gaian, ruled by Prince Avak. The Mongol commander Tokhta ruled out a direct assault and had his men construct a wall around the city, and Avak soon surrendered. By 1240, Chormaqan had completed the conquest of [[Transcaucasia]], forcing the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] nobles to surrender.\n\n=== Invasion of Korea ===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Korea}}\nIn 1224, a Mongol envoy was killed in obscure circumstances and Korea stopped paying [[tribute]].<ref>Michel Ho\u00e0ng, Ingrid Cranfield ''Genghis Khan'', p. 159.</ref> \u00d6gedei dispatched [[Saritai]] to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to [[Mongol invasions of Korea|invade Korea]] in order to subdue the kingdom. The [[Goryeo]] King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept [[darughachi|Mongol overseers]]. When they withdrew for the summer, however, [[Choe U]] moved the capital from [[Kaesong]] to [[Ganghwa Island|Ganghwa]] Island. Saritai was hit with a stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them.\n\n\u00d6gedei announced plans for the conquest of the [[Koreans]], the [[Southern Song]], the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]]s and their European allies, all of whom killed Mongol [[diplomat|envoy]]s, at the kurultai in Mongolia in 1234. \u00d6gedei appointed Danqu commander of the Mongol army and made Bog Wong, a defected Korean general, governor of 40 cities with their subjects. When the court of Goryeo sued for peace in 1238, \u00d6gedei demanded that the king of Goryeo appear before him in person. The Goryeo king finally sent his relative Yeong Nong-gun Sung with ten noble boys to [[Mongolia]] as [[hostage]]s, temporarily ending the war in 1241.<ref>J.Bor ''Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, vol.II'', p. 197.</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Capture of the Mongol-Tatars Russian city.jpg|230px|thumb|The Mongol army captures a [[Rus' people|Rus']] city]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\n\nThe Mongol Empire expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]] to subdue the Russian steppe and drive into Europe. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal, and [[Principality of Minsk|Minsk]], which became part of [[Lithuania]]), Hungary, Poland, Serbia and Bulgaria. During the siege of [[Kolomna]], the Khagan's half brother Khulgen<ref>He was the son of Genghis Khan by Khulan khatun of the Merkid clan.</ref> was killed by an arrow.\n\nAfter the conquest of [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Alania]], and the Rus' principalities, \u00d6gedei's son [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] and Chagatai's grandson [[B\u00fcri]] ridiculed Batu, and the Mongol camp suffered dissension. The Khagan harshly criticized G\u00fcy\u00fck: \"You broke the spirit of every man in your army...Do you think that the Russians surrendered because of how mean you were to your own men?\". He then sent G\u00fcy\u00fck back to continue the conquest of Europe. G\u00fcy\u00fck and another of \u00d6gedei's sons, [[Kadan]], attacked [[Transylvania]] and Poland, respectively.\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan had granted permission to invade the remainder of Europe, all the way to the \"Great Sea\", the Atlantic Ocean; his death prevented the invasions from continuing west, as Batu withdrew to participate in the election of a successor.\n\n=== Conflict with Song China ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}\n\nIn a series of razzias from 1235 to 1245, the Mongols commanded by \u00d6gedei's sons penetrated deep into the Song Dynasty and reached [[Chengdu]], [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and [[Yangtze River]]. But they could not succeed in completing their conquest due to climate and the number of Song troops, and \u00d6gedei's son Khochu died in the process. In 1240, \u00d6gedei's other son [[Khuden]] dispatched a subsidiary expedition to [[Tibet]]. The situation between the two nations worsened when Song officers murdered \u00d6gedei's envoys headed by Selmus.<ref>Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States'', p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe Mongol expansion throughout the Asian continent under the leadership of \u00d6gedei helped bring political stability and re-establish the [[Silk Road]], the primary trading route between East and West.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of India}}\n\n\u00d6gedei appointed Dayir commander of Ghazni and Menggetu commander in [[Qonduz]]. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the [[Indus valley]] and besieged [[Lahore]], which was controlled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. However, Dayir died storming the town, on 30 December 1241, and the Mongols butchered the town before withdrawing from the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref>Islamic Culture Board ''Islamic culture'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nSome time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded [[Kashmir]], stationing a [[darughachi]] there for several years. Soon Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency.<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p. 84.</ref> Around the same time, a Kashmiri [[Buddhist]] master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of \u00d6gedei.\n\n== Administration ==\n\u00d6gedei began the bureaucratization of Mongol administration. Three divisions constituted his administration: \n* the [[Christians|Christian]] eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], represented by Chinqai, the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[scribe]], and the [[Keraites]].\n* the Islamic cycle, represented by two [[Khorazm]]ians, Mahumud Yalavach, and Masud Beg.\n*the [[North Chinese]] [[Confucian]] circle, represented by [[Yelu Chucai]], a [[Khitan people|Khitan]], and Nianhe Zhong-shan, a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]].\n\nMahamud Yalavach promoted a system in which the government would delegate tax collection to [[tax farmer]]s who collect payments in silver. Yelu Chucai encouraged \u00d6gedei to institute a traditional Chinese system of government, with taxation in the hands of government agents and payment in a government issued currency. The Muslim merchants, working with capital supplied by the Mongol aristocrats, [[loan]]ed at higher [[interest rate|interest]] the silver needed for tax payments. At the same time the Mongols began circulating [[paper currency]] backed by silver reserves.\n\n[[File:Ogedei qaghan.svg|thumb|left|40px|''\u00d6gedei Khan'' in traditional [[Mongolian script]]]]\n\n\u00d6gedei abolished the branch departments of state affairs and divided the areas of Mongol-ruled China into ten routes according to the suggestion of Yel\u00fc Chucai. He also divided the empire into [[Beshbalik]] and [[Yanjing]] administration, while the headquarters in Karakorum directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Siberia. Late in his reign, [[Amu Darya]] administration was established. [[Turkestan]] was administered by Mahamud Yalavach, while Yelu Chucai administered North China from 1229 to 1240. \u00d6gedei appointed [[Shigi Khutugh]] chief judge in China. In [[Iran]], \u00d6gedei appointed first Chin-temur, a [[Kara-kitai]], and then [[Korguz]], an Uyghur who proved to be honest administrator. Later, some of Yelu Chucai's duties were transferred to Mahamud Yalavach and taxes were handed over to Abd-ur-Rahman, who promised to double the annual payments of silver.<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 102.</ref> The Ortoq or partner merchants lent \u00d6gedei's money at exorbitant rates of interest to the peasants, though \u00d6gedei banned considerably higher rates. Despite it proving profitable, many people fled their homes to avoid the tax collectors and their strong-arm gangs.\n\n\u00d6gedei had imperial princes tutored by the Christian scribe Qadaq and the [[Taoist]] priest Li Zhichang and built schools and an academy. \u00d6gedei Khan also decreed to issue paper currency backed by [[silk]] reserves and founded a Department responsible for destroying old notes. Yelu Chucai protested to \u00d6gedei that his large-scale distribution of [[appanage]]s in Iran, [[Western China|Western]] and North China, and Khorazm could lead to a disintegration of the Empire.<ref>Chunjiang Fu, Asiapac Editorial, Liping Yang ''Chinese History'', p. 148.</ref> \u00d6gedei thus decreed that the Mongol nobles could appoint overseers in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes.\n\nThe Khagan proclaimed the Great [[Yassa]] as an integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father's commands and ordinances, while adding his own. \u00d6gedei codified rules of dress and conduct during the kurultais. Throughout the Empire, in 1234, he created postroad stations ([[Yam (route)|Yam]]) with a permanent staff who would supply post riders' needs.<ref>Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach ''Medieval Islamic Civilization'', p. 632.</ref> Relay stations were set up every 25 miles and the yam staff supplied remounts to the envoys and served specified rations. The attached households were exempt from other taxes, but they had to pay a qubchuri tax to supply the goods. \u00d6gedei ordered Chagatai and Batu to control their yams separately. The Khagan prohibited the nobility from issuing [[paiza]]s (tablets that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations) and [[jarliq]]s. \u00d6gedei decreed that within decimal units one out of every 100 [[sheep]] of the well-off should be levied for the poor of the unit, and that one sheep and one mare from every herd should be forwarded to form a [[herd]] for the imperial table.<ref>Mongolia Society \u2013 Occasional Papers \u2013 p. 17.</ref>\n\n== Karakorum ==\n[[File:Karakorum - Tortue Sud.jpg|thumb|[[Bixi (tortoise)|Stone tortoise]] of Karakorum]]\n{{Main|Karakorum}}\n\nFrom 1235\u201338 \u00d6gedei constructed a series of palaces and [[pavilion]]s at stopping places in his annual [[nomad]]ic route through central Mongolia. The first palace Wanangong was constructed by North Chinese artisans. The Emperor urged his relatives build residences nearby and settled the deported craftsmen from China near the site. The construction of the city, [[Karakorum]] (\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c), was finished in 1235, assigning different quarters to Islamic and North Chinese craftsmen, who competed to win \u00d6gedei's favor. Earthen walls with 4 gates surrounded the city. Attached were private apartments, while in front of stood a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] bearing an engraved pillar, like those that were commonly used in East Asia. There was a castle with doors like the gates of the garden and a series of lakes where many water fowl gathered. \u00d6gedei erected several houses of worship for his Buddhist, Muslim, Taoist, and Christian followers. In the Chinese ward, there was a Confucian temple where Yelu Chucai used to create or regulate a calendar on the Chinese model.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:\u00d6gedei Khan Statue.JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of \u00d6gedei Khan in Mongolia]]\n\n\u00d6gedei was considered to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force of his personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.{{Citation needed|reason=many Reliable Sources exist-the editor should have referenced!|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe sudden death of [[Tolui]] in 1232 seems to have affected \u00d6gedei deeply. According to some sources, Tolui sacrificed his own life, accepting a poisoned drink in shamanist ritual in order to save \u00d6gedei who was suffering from illness.<ref>Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Rudi Paul Lindner, Valentin Aleksandrovich ''The Uralic and Altaic Series'', p. 176.</ref> Other sources say \u00d6gedei orchestrated Tolui's death with the help of shamans who drugged the alcoholic Tolui.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=92|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\n\u00d6gedei was well known for his [[alcoholism]]. Chagatai entrusted an official to watch his habit, but \u00d6gedei managed to drink anyway.  It is commonly told that \u00d6gedei did so by vowing to reduce the number of cups he drank a day then having cups twice the size created for his personal use. When he died at dawn on 11 December 1241, after a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman, the people blamed the sister of Tolui's widow and Abd-ur-Rahman. The Mongol aristocrats recognized, however, that the Khagan's own lack of self-control had killed him.\n\n\u00d6gedei was also known to be a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a [[dictator]].<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 104.</ref> Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to establish a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was a pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.\n\nHowever, Mongol and Persian chroniclers criticize \u00d6gedei for a crime he committed in 1237 which violated the laws of his father, Genghis Khan, which forbade seizure, rape, kidnapping, bartering, or selling young girls, who were allowed to be married at a young age but could not engage in sexual activity until the age of sixteen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> Mongol chronicles were vague about the nature of the crime, but Persian chroniclers indicated that after the Oirat did not send girls for \u00d6gedei's harem, \u00d6gedei had four thousand Oirat girls above the age of seven stripped naked and raped by his soldiers repeatedly in full sight of the girls' relatives. Two of these girls died from the ordeal, and the remaining non-raped were divided up by soldiers, with some being sent to the royal harem, and others assigned to caravan hostels for sexual servitude, and others not deemed suitable for this were left present for anyone to carry them away or use them for any purposes deemed fit. \u00d6gedei seems not to have done this out of sexual depravity as such, but more to consolidate power over the Oirat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\nThe above account, including the assumption that Mongol sources critized the crime (still questionable), was described in Jack Weatherford's 2011 book ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire''. Weatherford calls it \"the most horrendous crime of his twelve-year reign and one of the worst Mongol atrocities recorded\". A more recent book in feminist historiography \"Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire\" (2018) by Anne F. Broadbridge links the \"infamous alleged mass rape of Oirat girls\" to \u00d6gedei's requisitioning of girls from his uncle Tem\u00fcge Otchigin's territories without Tem\u00fcge's approval. Broadbridge notes however that \"with all the evidence suppressed, this can only be a surmise\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broadbridge |first1=Anne F. |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |page=187}}</ref> The History of the Yuan or ''Yuanshi'' (YS 2, 35) and Secret History of the Mongols (SHM 281) speak of a forceful requisitioning of women by \u00d6gedei from the \"left wing\" and \"uncle Otchigin's domain\" respectively but do not mention a rape (De Rachewiltz 2004).<ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032-1035}}</ref> In the Secret History \u00d6gedei expresses remorse for his act stating \"as to my second fault, to listen to the word of a woman without principle, and to have the girls of my uncle Otchigin's domain brought to me was surely a mistake\" but De Rachewiltz notes that the entire paragraph listing four good deeds and four mistakes may be a posthumous assessment (De Rachewiltz 2004).<ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032-1035}}</ref>\n\nThe only account alleging a rape is in Chapter 32 of the [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]] (History of the World Conqueror) written in 1252 by [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] (1226-1283).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boyle |first1=John Andrew |title=The History of the World Conqueror by Ala-ad-din Ata-Malik JUVAINI, Translated from the text of Mirza Muhammad Qazvini |date=1958 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge Massachusetts |page=201}}</ref> This entire chapter was later copied verbatim by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]] into his early 14th century [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Jami' Al-Tawarikh]] (Compendium of Chronicles) albeit in a slightly abridged version. In Chapter 32 Juvayni starts by praising \u00d6gedei Khan then proceeds to give 50 highly detailed anecdotes to illustrate \u00d6gedei's \"clemency, forgiveness, justice and generosity\" followed by one anecdote to illustrate his \"violence, severity, fury and awesomeness\" which was the rape incident. This anecdote closes the chapter. The name of the tribe is unclear in two manuscripts of Juvayni but Manuscript D and Rashid-Al-Din give it as Oirat. Broadbridge and De Rachewiltz questioned the factual accuracy of this identification with the Oirats.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broadbridge |first1=Anne F. |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |page=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032-1035}}</ref> The anecdotes are written in the style of a Persian tale.

This anecdote contradicts the standard account of \u00d6gedei's death from a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman. A number of anecdotes evince a tone of ridicule for \u00d6gedei's lack of self-control. While the anecdotes may contain a kernel of truth some seem to be apocryphal legends originating from the community of Muslim merchants and should be approached with a degree of caution. Another Persian account was the mass sodomy against soldiers of the Jin Dynasty quoted in Rashid-Al-Din and noted by Weatherford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref>. Homosexuality was taboo among the Mongols and punishable by death, so the factual accuracy of this \"act of the people of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]\" (Rashid-Al-Din) is still debatable. While Juvayni is a valuable source of information about the Mongol Empire his writings are commonly inflated, as when he estimates the strength of the Mongol army at 700,000, against other accounts that put the number between 105,000 and 130,000. Biased readings of Juvayni's account and projection of modern sensitivities backward in time has also led to the popular but unfounded theory that \u00d6gedei's wife T\u00f6regene and Fatima were in fact lesbian lovers. It is also notable that when Juvayni started writing the [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]] in Karakorum in the year 1252 the \u00d6gedeid faction had been purged by [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] so anti-\u00d6gedei bias could have been widespread.\n\n==Aftermath of \u00d6gedei's death==\n\n\u00d6gedei had nominated his grandson Shiremun as his heir, but G\u00fcy\u00fck eventually succeeded him after the five-year regency of his widow [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]]. However, Batu, the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] (also known as the Kipchak Khanate or the Ulus of Jochi) only nominally accepted G\u00fcy\u00fck, who died on the way to confront Batu. It was not until 1255, well into the reign of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], that Batu felt secure enough to again prepare to invade Europe.
