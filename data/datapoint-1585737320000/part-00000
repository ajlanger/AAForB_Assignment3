But these experiments do not test what people would do in situations that are forced or rushed, most mistakes are made from rushing and or forgetting something due to lack of concentration. Situationism can be looked at in many different ways, this means that situationism needs to be tested and experimented in many different ways.\n\n#\n\n==Experimental evidence==\n===Evidence for===\nMany studies have found evidence supporting situationism. One notable situationist study is [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]]'s [[Stanford prison experiment]]. This study was considered one of the most unethical because the participants were deceived and were physically and psychologically abused. The goal of the study was that Zimbardo wanted to discover two things. If prison guards abused prisoners because of their nature, or because of the power they were given in the situation. They also wanted to figure out of prisoners acted violent because of their nature or because of being in a secluded and violent environment. To carry out this experiment, Zimbardo gathered 24 college men and paid them 15 dollars an hour to live two weeks in a mock prison. The participants were told that they were chosen to be guard or prisoner because of their personality traits, but they were randomly selected. The prisoners were booked and given prison clothes and no possessions. They were also assigned a number to be referred to with the intent of farther dehumanizing them. Within the first night, the prisoner and guard dynamics began to take place. The guards started waking up the prisoners in the middle of the night for count, and they would yell and ridicule them. The prisoners also started developing hostile traits against the guards and having prison related conversations. By the second day, the guards started abusing the prisoners by forcing them to do push ups, and the prisoners started rebelling by removing their caps and numbers, and hiding in their cells with their mattresses blocking the door. As the days passed the relationship between the guards and prisoners became extremely hostile- the prisoners fought for their independence, and the guards fought to strip them of it.\n\nThere were many cases where the prisoners began breaking down psychologically, and it all started with prisoner 8612. After one day after the experiment started, prisoner number 8612 has anxiety attacks and asked to leave. He was then told \"You can't leave. You can't quit.\u201d He then went back to the prison and \u201cbegan to act \u2018crazy,\u2019 to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control.\u201d <ref name=\"simplypsychology.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> After this, he was sent home. The other prisoner that broke down was 819. 819 Had broken down and was told to rest in a room. When Dr.Zimbardo when to check on him he said \" what I found was a boy crying hysterically while in the background his fellow prisoners were yelling and chanting that he was a bad prisoner, that they were being punished because of him.\" Zimbardo then allowed him to leave but he said he couldn't because he was labeled as a bad prisoner, to which Zimbardo Responded \"Listen, you are not 819. My name is Dr. Zimbardo, I am a psychologist, and this is not a prison. This is just an experiment and those are students, just like you. Let's go. \" He stopped crying suddenly and looked up at me just like a small child awakened from a nightmare and said, \"OK, let's go.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=August 1971|title=THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/spec_coll/uarch/exhibits/Narration.pdf|journal=A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe guards also began to have extremely abusive relations with the prisoners. Zimbardo claimed there were three types of guards. The first were the guards that followed all the rules but got the job done, the second felt bad for the prisoners, and the third were extremely hostile and treated them like animals. This last type showed behaviors of actual guards and seemed to have forgotten they were college students, they got into their roles faster, and seemed to enjoy tormenting the prisoners. On Thursday night, 6 days into the experiment, Zimbardo described the guards as having \"sadistic\" behavior, and then decided to close down the study early.\n\nThis study showed how regular people can completely disassociate with who they are when their environment changes. Regular college boys turned into broken down prisoners and sadistic guards.\n\nStudies investigating [[Bystander effect|bystander]] effects also support situationism. For example, in 1973, [[John M. Darley|Darley]] and [[Daniel Batson|Batson]] conducted a study where they asked students at a seminary school to give a presentation in a separate building. They gave each individual participant a topic, and would then tell a participant that they were supposed to be there immediately, or in a few minutes, and sent them on their way to the building. On the way, each participant encountered a confederate who was on the ground, clearly in need of medical attention. Darley and Batson observed that more participants who had extra time stopped to help the confederate than those who were in a hurry. Helping was not predicted by religious personality measures, and the results therefore indicate that the situation influenced their behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Darley |first1=J.

Stanley Milgram made his obedience study to explain the obedience phenomenon, specifically the holocaust. He wanted to explain how people follow orders, and how people are likely to do unmoral things when ordered to by people of authority. The way the experiment was devised was that Milgram picked 40 men from a newspaper add to take part in a study at Yale University.<ref name=\"simplypsychology.org\"/> The men were between 20 and 50 years old, and were paid $4.50 for showing up. In this study, a participant was assigned to be a \"teacher\" and a confederate was assigned to be a \"learner\". The teachers were told the learners had to memorize word pairs, and every time they got it wrong they were shocked with increasing voltages. The voltages ranged from 15 to 450, and in order for the participants to believe the shock was real, the experimenters administered to them a real 45v shock, The participant was unaware that the learner was a confederate. The participant would test the learner, and for each incorrect answer the learner gave, the participant would have to shock the learner with increasing voltages. The shocks were not actually administered, but the participant believed they were. When the shocks reached 300v, the learner began to protest and show discomfort. [[Stanley Milgram|Milgram]] expected participants to stop the procedure, but 65% of them continued to completion, administering shocks that could have been fatal, even if they were uncomfortable or upset. Even though most of the participants continued administering the shocks, they had distressed reactions when administering the shocks, such as laughing hysterically. Participants felt compelled to listen to the experimenter, who was the authority figure present in the room and continued to encourage the participant throughout the study. Out of 40 participants, 26 went all the way to the end.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|date=1963|title=Behavioral Study of Obedience|url=https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/pdf/MilgramOriginalWork.pdf|journal=Behavioral Study of Obedience|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence against===\nPersonality traits have a very weak relationship to behavior in contrast, situational factors usually have a stronger impact on behavior; Which is the core evidence of situationism.
