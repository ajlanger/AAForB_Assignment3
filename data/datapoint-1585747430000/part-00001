Originally intended as a twelve-week experiment, the programme appeared to have become a permanent fixture in the CNBC Europe schedule. While advertised as \"strictly for the United Kingdom\", the programme was in fact also broadcast on both the [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Digital]] and [[UPC Ireland]] systems in the [[Republic of Ireland]], meaning that practically all domestic and a large proportion of commercial customers also in Ireland received the programme. Outside of the UK and Ireland, [[Squawk Box]] from [[CNBC]] US was screened instead.\n\nAfter the cancellation of ''Power Lunch Europe'', many of the segments that used to appear on that program moved to ''Strictly Money'', including the \"Investor Clinic\" and the \"Halftime Report.\"\n\nOn the day each month when the bank lending rates are announced, the programme was retitled \"Strictly Rates\" and was extended to two hours due to the timing of the rates decisions - 1200 for the UK announcement and 1245 for the ECB announcement. The monthly edition of Strictly Rates was broadcast across Europe as well as in the UK and Ireland.\n\n==Cancellation==\n''Strictly Money'' ended its 2-year run on 11 March 2011. However the monthly ''Strictly Rates'' specials continued to be broadcast but eventually ''Strictly Rates'' was renamed ''Decision Time''.\n\n{{CNBC Europe Business Day}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:CNBC Europe programmes]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:British television news programmes]]\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British television series]]\n[[Category:2011 British television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Strictly Money\n| image                = Strictly Money.png\n| image_size           = 230px\n| caption              =\n| genre                = Business News and Analysis\n| camera               =\n| picture_format       =\n| audio_format         =\n| runtime              = 60 minutes\n| creator              =\n| developer            =\n| producer             =\n| executive_producer   =\n| presenter            = [[Ross Westgate]]\n| starring             =\n| voices               =\n| narrated             =\n| theme_music_composer =\n| opentheme            =\n| endtheme             =\n| country              = United Kingdom\n| location             =\n| language             = English\n| network              = [[CNBC Europe]]\n| first_aired          = 12 January 2009\n| last_aired           = 11 March 2011\n| num_seasons          =\n| num_episodes         =\n| list_episodes        =\n| preceded_by          = ''[[Power Lunch Europe]]''<br/>''[[Squawk Box]]'', replacing the first hour\n| followed_by          = incumbent\n| related              =\n| website              = https://www.cnbc.com/id/15838641/site/14081545/\n}}\n\n'''''Strictly Money''''' is a business news programme aired on [[CNBC Europe]] in the United Kingdom and for domestic customers in the [[Republic of Ireland]], each weekday at 11:00am [[Western European Time]], between 2009 and 2011.
