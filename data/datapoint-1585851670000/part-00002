The agreement stated that the players would have an increased base pay and improved match bonuses. These changes could increase their previous pay from $200,000 to $300,000. This 2017 CBA, however, does not guarantee the U.S national women's team equal pay with the men's national team. The CBA's five-year term, through 2021, ensured that the next negotiation would not become an issue for the team in its next major competitions. On top of this CBA, U.S Soccer had agreed to pay the players for two years' worth of unequal per-diem payments.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-soccer-labor-deal-contract.html |title=Long Days, Google Docs and Anonymous Surveys: How the U.S. Soccer Team Forged a Deal |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=April 5, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=March 8, 2019  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOn March 8, 2019, all 28 members of the U.S. team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=March 8, 2019 |work=The New York Times|access-date=March 8, 2019  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Los Angeles, accused the Federation of \"institutional gender discrimination.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/653-us-womens-soccer-complaint/f9367608e2eaf10873f4/optimized/full.pdf#page=1 |title=Case No. 2:19-CV-01717 |last=Winston & Strawn LLP |date=March 8, 2019 }}</ref> The lawsuit claims that the discrimination affects not only the amount the players are paid but also their playing, training, and travel conditions.\n\n==Staff==\n'''Coaching staff'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
