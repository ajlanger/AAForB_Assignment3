Garland appeared in 34 feature films. She was nominated for multiple [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]], receiving an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] and one Golden Globe. Her film career was interrupted in 1951 after she was cast in a series of films she was unable to complete, but she returned to the screen in 1954 in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' and continued to appear in films until 1963.\n\nAlthough Garland appeared in concert as early as 1943, it was only when her film career stalled that she began regular concert appearances, beginning with a critically acclaimed 1951 concert series at the [[London Palladium]]. Garland set a record when she appeared for 19 weeks at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, also in 1951, and her 1961 concert ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'' is often considered as one of the greatest nights in show business history. She continued to tour until just three months prior to her death in 1969.\n\nGarland starred in a series of television specials beginning in 1955, when she appeared in the first episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''. The success of these specials led CBS to offer Garland a regular series. ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' premiered in 1963. Although the show was critically well-received, it suffered in the [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen ratings]] from being scheduled across from ''[[Bonanza]]'', which was then the most popular show on the air. ''The Judy Garland Show'' was canceled after one season but Garland and the series were nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n[[File:Judy Garland in A Star is Born trailer.jpg|thumb|Judy Garland as Vicki Lester in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'']]\n[[File:Judygarland astarisborn warnerbros publicitystill 19542.jpg|thumb|right|Gatland in a 1954 publicity still]] \n[[File:Judy Garland in Presenting Lily Mars.jpg|thumb|Garland given the Hollywood \"glamor treatment\" for her role in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Garland in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]\n[[File:Meet Me In St Louis Judy Garland Margaret O'Brien 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Garland with [[Margaret O'Brien]] in 1944]]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Garland performing \"The Trolley Song\" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Judgement at Nuremberg trailer.jpg|thumb|Garland as Mrs. Wallner in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'']]\n\n===Feature films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Pigskin Parade]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1936\n| Sairy Dodd\n| Film  debut\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Betty Clayton\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Cricket West\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Everybody Sing]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Judy Bellaire\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Listen, Darling]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| \"Pinkie\" Wingate\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| [[Dorothy Gale]]\n| rowspan=2| Garland was honored with an [[Academy Juvenile Award]]{{efn|\"for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year\" for ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.<ref name = tvguide>{{cite web\n  | title =Judy Garland: Biography\n  | publisher =TV Guide\n  | url =http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/judy-garland/bio/159192\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-03 }}</ref>}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| Patsy Barton\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Mary Holden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Nellie Noonan Kelly / Little Nellie Kelly\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Susan Gallagher\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Betsy Booth\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes on Broadway]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Penny Morris\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1942}}\n| Jo Hayden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Lily Mars\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thousands Cheer]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Herself\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Ginger Gray\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1944}}\n| Esther Smith\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| Alice Mayberry\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| The Star\n| \"The Great Lady Has An Interview\" segment\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| Susan Bradley\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| [[Marilyn Miller]]\n| Performed \"[[Look for the Silver Lining]]\", \"[[Sunny (musical)#Songs|Sunny]]\" and \"[[Who?

Garland appeared in 34 feature films. She was nominated for multiple [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]], receiving an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] and one Golden Globe. Her film career was interrupted in 1951 after she was cast in a series of films she was unable to complete, but she returned to the screen in 1954 in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' and continued to appear in films until 1963.\n\nAlthough Garland appeared in concert as early as 1943, it was only when her film career stalled that she began regular concert appearances, beginning with a critically acclaimed 1951 concert series at the [[London Palladium]]. Garland set a record when she appeared for 19 weeks at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, also in 1951, and her 1961 concert ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'' is often considered as one of the greatest nights in show business history. She continued to tour until just three months prior to her death in 1969.\n\nGarland starred in a series of television specials beginning in 1955, when she appeared in the first episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''. The success of these specials led CBS to offer Garland a regular series. ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' premiered in 1963. Although the show was critically well-received, it suffered in the [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen ratings]] from being scheduled across from ''[[Bonanza]]'', which was then the most popular show on the air. ''The Judy Garland Show'' was canceled after one season but Garland and the series were nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n[[File:Judy Garland in A Star is Born trailer.jpg|thumb|Judy Garland as Vicki Lester in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'']]\n[[File:Judygarland astarisborn warnerbros publicitystill 19542.jpg|thumb|right|Gatland in a 1954 publicity still]] \n[[File:Judy Garland in Presenting Lily Mars.jpg|thumb|Garland given the Hollywood \"glamor treatment\" for her role in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Garland in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]\n[[File:Meet Me In St Louis Judy Garland Margaret O'Brien 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Garland with [[Margaret O'Brien]] in 1944]]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Garland performing \"The Trolley Song\" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Judgement at Nuremberg trailer.jpg|thumb|Garland as Mrs. Wallner in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'']]\n\n===Feature films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Pigskin Parade]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1936\n| Sairy Dodd\n| Film  debut\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Betty Clayton\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Cricket West\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Everybody Sing]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Judy Bellaire\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Listen, Darling]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| \"Pinkie\" Wingate\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| [[Dorothy Gale]]\n| rowspan=2| Garland was honored with an [[Academy Juvenile Award]]{{efn|\"for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year\" for ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.<ref name = tvguide>{{cite web\n  | title =Judy Garland: Biography\n  | publisher =TV Guide\n  | url =http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/judy-garland/bio/159192\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-03 }}</ref>}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| Patsy Barton\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Mary Holden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Nellie Noonan Kelly / Little Nellie Kelly\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Susan Gallagher\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Betsy Booth\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes on Broadway]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Penny Morris\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1942}}\n| Jo Hayden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Lily Mars\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thousands Cheer]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Herself\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Ginger Gray\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1944}}\n| Esther Smith\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| Alice Mayberry\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| The Star\n| \"The Great Lady Has An Interview\" segment\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| Susan Bradley\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| [[Marilyn Miller]]\n| Performed \"[[Look for the Silver Lining]]\", \"[[Sunny (musical)#Songs|Sunny]]\" and \"[[Who?
