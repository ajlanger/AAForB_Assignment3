This method required burning timber to be placed on the rock surface. The heat generated would be sufficient to crack the rock, and any moisture within would become vaporized and expand further cracking the rock. The separated rock would be easily removed either by hand or with the use of picks and shovels.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Stoping#Open-stope%20systems|'''Open Stope mining''':]] This is a method of underground mining where ore bodies are completely removed leaving sizeable caverns (stopes) within the mine. Open stope mining leaves these caverns with no additional bracing or external support. What is used to support the cavern walls, are random pillars of ore which have not removed.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cut and Fill stoping''': A method of underground mining which removes ore from below the deposit. The stope is then filled with waste rock to replace the mined out ore to support the stope walls, and to provide an elevated floor for the miners and equipment to further extract ore from the deposit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Production ==\n{{see also|List of countries by zinc production}}\nThe global mine production of zinc in 2019 was 12.9 million tons or a 0.9% increase from 2018, with the increase primarily attributed to the increased output from zinc mines located in Australia and South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=International Lead and Zinc Study Group|date=19 February 2020 |title=Review of Trends in 2019 - Zinc |url=http://www.ilzsg.org/generic/pages/file.aspx?file_id=2596|location=Lisbon, Portugal}}</ref><ref name=usgs/> \u00a0\n\nIn 2020 production of zinc is expected to rise 3.7% to 13.99 million tons, with this increase caused by increased production of zinc generated by China and India.<ref name=ilzsg4>{{Cite journal|last=International Lead and Zinc Study Group|date=October 28, 2019|title=ILZSG SESSION/FORECASTS|url=http://www.ilzsg.org/pages/document/p1/list.aspx?id=2&from=1&ff_aa_document_type=R&select=A|journal=ILZSG Publications|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the global demand for refined zinc exceeded supply and resulted in a deficit of 0.178 million tonnes, while in 2020 there is an expected surplus of 0.192 million tonnes.<ref name=ilzsg4/>\n\nZinc producing countries ranked by their output for 2019 is as follows:<ref name=usgs/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Country'''\n|'''Output'''<br>(million tonnes)\n|-\n|China\n|4.371\n|-\n|Peru\n|1.404\n|-\n|Australia\n|1.283\n|-\n|USA\n|0.795\n|-\n|India\n|0.712\n|-\n|Mexico\n|0.703\n|-\n|Bolivia\n|0.46\n|-\n|Canada\n|0.339\n|-\n|Other Countries\n|2.83\n|}\n\n== Environmental impact ==\nResearch conducted in the health of the benthic macroinvertebrate populations in the mining areas of southeastern Missouri, a US state, have yielded a wealth of information on the effect of zinc mining and its effect on its local environment.
