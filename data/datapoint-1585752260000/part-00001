It is situated southeast of the capital city of [[Sarajevo]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 22,282 inhabitants, while the town of Pale has a population of 13,883 inhabitants.\n\nThe famous [[Jahorina ski resort]] is located some {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from the municipality.\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nPale always represented an important junction between east and west that is the [[Sarajevo]] Valley and the [[Drina]] River basin. There are preserved ruins of roads and building from the Roman times in the nearby villages of Miosici and Ilijak. From early on this area served as a place of trade. In the late 14th and early 15th century the area surrounding Pale belonged to the Feudal [[House of Pavlovi\u0107]]. There were several fortified settlements: Pavlovac on the River Pra\u010da, Gradina in the Upper Pale and Hodidjed above the junction of the Miljacka rivers. The Hodidjed settlement served as an administrative center for the surrounding area.\n\nThe feudal house of Pavlovi\u0107 belonged to the upper crust of the Bosnian aristocracy, their holdings extended from [[Vrhbosna]] (today's [[Sarajevo]]) on the West to Dobruna on the east. Pavle Radenovi\u0107, the founder of the Pavlovi\u0107 line, aside from his ancestral holdings around Pale also owned the mines in Olovo, the city of Trebinje, and parts of Konavle and [[Cavtat]]. The area under his control enjoyed prosperous trade between the locals and the Merchants from [[Dubrovnik]]. The main trading center was the town of Praca, part of the Pale Municipality today. After the death of Pavle in 1415 during a duel, his younger son Radoslav Pavlovi\u0107 (1420\u20131421) would take over from his father.\n\nAfter the death of the Bosnian [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|King Tvrtko I]] in 1391 the Bosnian feudals houses struggled to gain the throne. The sons of Pavle, under the threat from other Bosnian aristocrats, asked for the help of their allies the [[Ottomans]]. The Ottomans pursued a strategy of divide and conquer that eventually resulted in complete conquest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D59%26Itemid%3D69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923170721/http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=69 |archivedate=September 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter the [[Fall of Bosnia to the Ottomans|fall of Bosnia]] the feudal holdings of the House of Pavlovi\u0107 were divided into 11 districts, and renamed the entire area the \"Pavli [[Vilayet]]. The first Ottoman census in the year 1468\u201369 the town of Pale is recorded under the name of \"Bogazi Yumry\" as the seat of one of the 11 districts. The district of \"Bogazi Yumry\" contained six villages of which two were located on the plane of Pale.\n\nDue to the harsh conditions in which the local Christian population found itself, there is very little data about the urban development during the Ottoman rule of this area in the Middle Ages. The area continued to be commercially viable and valuable to the new rulers. The town of Praca continued to grow and expand until the great fire and outbreak of Black Death in the 18th century. The name \"Pavli Vilayet\" continued to be used for this area until the beginning of the 19th century and the town eventually came to be known as Pale. One of the earliest recordings of this new name is a map from 1877, where the town itself as well as the entire region are labelled as \"Pale\".\n\nDuring the 19th century the Ottoman Empire found itself under the two politically and socially completely different power struggles. The early decades of the 19th century were marked with a series of national and ethnic freedom movements of the many subject people. The Ottoman aristocracy on the other hand was deeply conservative and was resisting any efforts towards reform and development of a centralized state. The aristocracy in Bosnia was among the most dissatisfied in the empire, jealously guarding its right against the powers.\n\nIn 1831, Captain [[Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful members of the Bosnian aristocracy, came to lead the rebel aristocrats. After the conquest of Travnik, the seat of the Ottoman Viceroy, the Bosnian aristocracy demanded that the Sultan halt his reform efforts and keep the status quo in Bosnia. In addition they wanted the right to vote for and appoint the Viceroy from among their ranks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCaptain Hussain did not wait for the Sultan to answer their demands and appointed himself the Vice Roy of Bosnia, alienating many of his supporters in the process. The Sultan played the different factions against each other and in 1832 sent an army against the rebels. One of the decisive battles against the rebels took place in the town of Pale itself. Captain Husein did not command sufficient numbers of troops and suffered a defeat. The decisive victory broke the back of the revolt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Narrow-Gauge-Railway Ostbahn Station-Pale.jpg|thumb|left|Railway station in Pale after opening in 1906]]\nWith the [[Berlin Congress]] Bosnia was [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|placed under the administration of Austria-Hungary]]. During this time significant investment and economic changes were made in Pale and the surrounding areas.\n\nThe new overlords were favoring the exploitation of the natural resources, primarily mineral and wood products.  The town of Pale at this point becomes an important logging and wood products center in the region. According to the 1895 census, Pale with the adjacent villages had 483 inhabitants. 440 inhabitants were engaged in agricultural and logging activities while 27 were engaged in clerical work. Industrial development spurs on supporting activities. New trade shops, hotels and other service activities are brought to the town.\n\nIn February 1907 Pale receives the first Elementary School. The school was administered by the school-church board of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in Pale. The school admitted students regardless of their faith. Along with Orthodox Christians, Catholic and Jewish students also attended the school. These were mostly the children of people who were involved in the town log mill.\n\nAccording to administrative records of the Austro-Hungarian administration, by 1879 in Pale there were already two modern log mills, and their products were transported to Sarajevo.  With the construction of the rail line connecting the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo with its eastern border town [[Vi\u0161egrad]] the town of Pale received its first railway station. The railway link enabled Pale to continue to grow and prosper with foreign investment making it possible to open several additional mills in the town. Construction of the [[East Bosnian railway|Bosnian Eastern Railway]] from [[Sarajevo]] to [[Uvac, Rudo|Uvac]] and [[Donje Vardi\u0161te|Vardi\u0161te]] started in 1903. It was completed in 1906, using the {{RailGauge|760mm|lk=on}} [[track gauge]]. With the cost of 75 million gold crowns, which approximately translates to 450 thousand gold crowns per kilometer, it was one of the most expensive railways in the world built by that time. The line was closed down in 1978, and dismantled afterwards.<ref name=\"VisegradTurizam NGR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|title=Narrow-gauge railway in Vi\u0161egrad|website=visegradturizam.com|publisher=Tourist organization of Vi\u0161egrad|access-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917020046/http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|archivedate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nIn the early months of 1914 after the decisive Serbian victory at the [[Battle of Cer]] the allies requested from the Serbs and their Montenegrin allies to attack the Austro-Hungarians in Bosnia and tie up their forces there.\n\nIn October 1914 the Serbo-Montenegrin armies penetrated the areas surrounding Sarajevo and gained control of Mt. Romanija. During that operation, Montenegrin units entered Pale. Soon afterwards, the Montegrins had to withdraw. Along with them a large part of the local Serbian population.\n\nThose who were unable to flee were at the mercy of the Austrian Schutz corps, irregular Austrian police forces tasked with suppressing revolt within the empire. Pale was pillaged and burned down completely after the Austrian forces re-entered the town. 54 local residents were lynched in the town center.\n\nIn the town of [[Gora\u017ede]], a refugee column of villagers from nearby villages such as Praca, Vijara, Budj, Podgrab, Vrhpraca, Gorovici, Hotocine, Glasinac, Podromanija and Socica were intercepted by Austrian regular forces and the irregulars before they could cross the [[Drina]] river. 48 adult men were separated from the rest of the group and executed by pistol-shot, while the remaining refugees were forced into detention camps.\n\nConditions in these detention camps were especially harsh. Among the most infamous was the detention camp in [[Doboj]]. From December 1914 to July 1917 more than 45,000 people (mostly [[Serbs]]) were detained there. While the exact numbers of fatalities will probably never be known, more than 1000 fatalities were identified, 230 of which were from the Pale municipality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Post WWI===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nWith the end of the war and the absorption of Bosnia into the newly created Kingdom of [[Yugoslavia]], the town of Pale once again struck out towards growth. The basis for economic recovery and development once again, as before, were based the on the natural resources of the region, in particular forestry.\n\nNewly developed transportation links with [[Sarajevo]] spurred growth. In 1928 the town itself became the center of the municipality. By 1939 there were more than 14 log mills in Pale which generated more than {{convert|90000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. Increased economic development spurred population growth. Between 1921 and 1931 the number of inhabitants increased from 2,382 to 11,103.\n\nIn the 1930 one could already find 30 to 40 large buildings. In 1935 a modern water supply system was put into use. The town flourished culturally as well. New and old schools were renovated and built. A community center, completed in 1928, dedicated to the victims of World War I featured gymnastic equipment and from time to time cultural and entertainment events were held there. Amateur theater and folk dance companies were active there as well.\n\nIn 1934 the Vihor Football Club was founded, and along with it a new soccer stadium was constructed. The cultural and sport society \"Soko\" was responsible for a large level of participation by Pale's inhabitants in their athletic programs. The members of this club would go on to successfully compete in [[Zagreb]], [[Ljubljana]] and [[Prague]]. In this period the town also received the first medical facility as well as a library.\n\nBy the 1940 Pale already have the looks of a small, but very well arranged city. A significant number of intellectuals as well as affluent and influential people from Sarajevo and other places in the country constructed summer homes in Pale.  All of this was interrupted with the German attack on Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the conquests of Zagreb and Belgrade the German forces turned their drive towards the center of the country. On 15 April, a German motorized division would occupy Sarajevo and capture the Yugoslav Supreme Military command in the town of Pale itself. By April 1941 a complete surrender was signed. The short April war brought on a full dismemberment of the country. The town of Pale was incorporated into the Nazi-affiliated [[Independent State of Croatia]].\n\nThe first of act of the newly installed puppet regime in the town of Pale was the demolition of the World War I Victim Memorial as well the demolition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. All Serb enterprises were nationalized and taken over by Nazi sympathizers. The former home to the cultural center was turned into the HQ of the local regiment of Ustashe, which would soon serve as prison and detention center. Mass deportations, executions of prominent Serbs were daily occurrences. During the summer of 1941 the first massacres occurred, the villages of Njemanici and Bjelogorica were completely destroyed and more than sixty people were murdered.\n\nFaced with this kind of mistreatment the local populace started an armed revolt. The initial skirmishes took place in the early morning hours of 1 August 1941. The occupation forces tried to brutally suppress this revolt and during the month of August more than 75 prominent town folk were arrested and deported to death camps.\n\nIn mid-November 1943 in a retaliatory expedition the Ustashe killed more than 100 inhabitants of the village of [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]. After 45 men out of that village reported to the [[Usta\u0161e]] administration for the issuance of new identification documents they were all arrested and in pairs of two were chained to each other. They were transported and murdered. After they killed the men they went to Rakovac to kill the remaining women, children and the elderly. Once the surviving witnesses, Milan Star\u010devi\u0107, residing today in Pale, testified: ''\"After they say that a part of the village inhabitants was missing the Ustashe sent out search parties and came to the Alija Hill. There they were stopped by the Germans. The Germans did not allow them to go into the Santrac house where about 10 or so women and children had fled. There were even shots exchanged among the Ustashe and the Germans.\"''\n\nThe next day Milan Star\u010devi\u0107's brother went with German troops back to bury the victims of the Ustashe massacre. During World War II in the municipality of Pale more than 1200 civilians were murdered, while another 350 resistance fighters were killed in the fighting.\n\n===Pale after WWII===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter World War II, the town and municipality of Pale, thanks to the tireless efforts of the local population, slowly recover and resume their economic development. In 1946 on the foundations of the old log mil a new one is constructed. This new mill would produce more than {{convert|25000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. The mill itself employed more than 170 in the mill and an addition 150 in the forest.\n\nIn 1952 a military maintenance facility in the suburb of Koran was constructed. The local economy received the first important building block for the metal industry. Between 1952 and 1960 and additional 300\u2013400 employees were hired in that facility.\n\nWith the development of the metal industry there are significant migration into the town, the suburb of Koran is built out with new building and apartment complexes constructed.\n\nIn 1968 the Military Maintenance complex in Koran enters is merged with the \"FAMOS\" corporation and is incorporated as \"FAMOS-Koran\". This merger brings further development and new work opportunities. Famos-Koran would go on to manufacture parts for heavy engines, transmissions and vehicles. Towards the end of the 1980s there were more than 2000 employees at Famos-Koran. In addition factories were add for the manufacture of engine turbos and manufacture of parts for the Mercedes Benz OM-360 engine that was built under licence.\n\n===War in Bosnia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDuring 1991 and 1992, as the tensions rose in the run up to the [[Bosnian War]], the Pale region became an administrative center of the nascent anti-Sarajevo and pro-Serb [[Republika Srpska]]. It would remain a center of activity for the Serb forces during their [[Siege of Sarajevo]] which led to the deaths of more than 10,000 people and the wounding of 56,000 (including 15,000 children). Several high ranking Serb commanders in control of forces from the region, including General [[Stanislav Gali\u0107]] were sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against the people of Sarajevo where a campaign of unrelenting violence against the inhabitants was led.\n\nThe town became the nominal administrative headquarters of the Bosnian Serb government, while [[Banja Luka]] became the ''de facto'' capital. Pale remained an important cultural center with a collection of cultural and informational institutions such as a news agency (SRNA), a television station (Canal S) and newspapers (''Javnost'' and ''Ognji\u0161ta'') are based there.\n\n===Post Dayton===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nThe Bosnian War ended with the signing of the Dayton Peace accords on 14 December 1995. With the war at the end the town return to some sort of normalcy. As the [[Constitution of Republika Srpska]] sets out that [[Sarajevo]] is the capital of [[Republika Srpska]] which was recognized as an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. The administrative capital has now transferred to [[Banja Luka]].\n\nIn 2013 the local authorities and residents welcomed convicted war criminal [[Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik]] after his release from jail. In 2006, he had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for crimes against humanity on non-Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, some of which included persecution, extermination, murder and forced deportations. But his sentence was reduced and he was released early. The Municipal Board of the Serbian Democratic Party prepared the welcome which was attended by 3,000 Serbs.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/116577/war-criminal-krajisnik-welcomed-by-serbs-in-pale |title=War criminal Krajisnik welcomed by Serbs in Pale &#124; Balkans &#124; Worldbulletin News |publisher=Worldbulletin.net |date=2013-08-31 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bjelogorci (Pale)|Bjelogorci]]\n* [[Blju\u0161tevac]]\n* [[Bogovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdari\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdo (Pale)|Brdo]]\n* [[Brezovice (Pale)|Brezovice]]\n* [[Brnjica (Pale)|Brnjica]]\n* [[Brojni\u0107i]]\n* [[Bu\u0111]]\n* [[\u010celjadini\u0107i]]\n* [[\u010cemernica (Pale)|\u010cemernica]]\n* [[\u0106emanovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Datelji]]\n* [[Donja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Donja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gluhovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Gornja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gornje Pale]]\n* [[Gornji Pribanj]]\n* [[Gorovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gradac (Pale)|Gradac]]\n* [[Gute (Pale)|Gute]]\n* [[Hoto\u010dina]]\n* [[Jahorina (Pale)|Jahorina]]\n* [[Jasik (Pale)|Jasik]]\n* [[Jelovci]]\n* [[Kadino Selo]]\n* [[Kamenica (Pale)|Kamenica]]\n* [[Kasidoli]]\n* [[Komrani]]\n* [[Kosmaj (Pale)|Kosmaj]]\n* [[Kostre\u0161a]]\n* [[Kra\u010dule]]\n* [[Luke (Pale)|Luke]]\n* [[Mio\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Modrik]]\n* [[Mokro (Pale)|Mokro]]\n* [[Nehori\u0107i (Pale)|Nehori\u0107i]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Pavlovac (Pale)|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Petovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Podgrab]]\n* [[Podloznik]]\n* [[Podmedenik]]\n* [[Podvitez]]\n* [[Ponor (Pale)|Ponor]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Prutine]]\n* [[Pustopolje]]\n* [[Radonji\u0107i (Pale)|Radonji\u0107i]]\n* [[Rakite]]\n* [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Renovica]]\n* [[Rogou\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Rosulje (Pale)|Rosulje]]\n* [[Saice]]\n* [[Sinjevo]]\n* [[Sjetlina]]\n* [[Srednje (Pale)|Srednje]]\n* [[Stajna]]\n* [[Stambol\u010di\u0107]]\n* [[Strane (Pale)|Strane]]\n* [[Sumbulovac]]\n* [[\u0160ainovi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ip (Pale)|\u0160ip]]\n* [[Turkovi\u0107i (Pale)|Turkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ude\u017e]]\n* [[Vinograd]]\n* [[Vlahovi\u0107i (Pale)|Vlahovi\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Dating of the remnants places them in the late Bronze Age, but remnants dating back to neolite and mezolite age are also expected to be found.\n\nBecause of its scientific and aesthetic characteristics the cave is destined to become the focus of the research and educational projects of the Faculty of Philosophy in Pale.

It is situated southeast of the capital city of [[Sarajevo]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 22,282 inhabitants.\n\nThe famous [[Jahorina ski resort]] is located some {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from the municipality.\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nPale always represented an important junction between east and west that is the [[Sarajevo]] Valley and the [[Drina]] River basin. There are preserved ruins of roads and building from the Roman times in the nearby villages of Miosici and Ilijak. From early on this area served as a place of trade. In the late 14th and early 15th century the area surrounding Pale belonged to the Feudal [[House of Pavlovi\u0107]]. There were several fortified settlements: Pavlovac on the River Pra\u010da, Gradina in the Upper Pale and Hodidjed above the junction of the Miljacka rivers. The Hodidjed settlement served as an administrative center for the surrounding area.\n\nThe feudal house of Pavlovi\u0107 belonged to the upper crust of the Bosnian aristocracy, their holdings extended from [[Vrhbosna]] (today's [[Sarajevo]]) on the West to Dobruna on the east. Pavle Radenovi\u0107, the founder of the Pavlovi\u0107 line, aside from his ancestral holdings around Pale also owned the mines in Olovo, the city of Trebinje, and parts of Konavle and [[Cavtat]]. The area under his control enjoyed prosperous trade between the locals and the Merchants from [[Dubrovnik]]. The main trading center was the town of Praca, part of the Pale Municipality today. After the death of Pavle in 1415 during a duel, his younger son Radoslav Pavlovi\u0107 (1420\u20131421) would take over from his father.\n\nAfter the death of the Bosnian [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|King Tvrtko I]] in 1391 the Bosnian feudals houses struggled to gain the throne. The sons of Pavle, under the threat from other Bosnian aristocrats, asked for the help of their allies the [[Ottomans]]. The Ottomans pursued a strategy of divide and conquer that eventually resulted in complete conquest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D59%26Itemid%3D69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923170721/http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=69 |archivedate=September 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter the [[Fall of Bosnia to the Ottomans|fall of Bosnia]] the feudal holdings of the House of Pavlovi\u0107 were divided into 11 districts, and renamed the entire area the \"Pavli [[Vilayet]]. The first Ottoman census in the year 1468\u201369 the town of Pale is recorded under the name of \"Bogazi Yumry\" as the seat of one of the 11 districts. The district of \"Bogazi Yumry\" contained six villages of which two were located on the plane of Pale.\n\nDue to the harsh conditions in which the local Christian population found itself, there is very little data about the urban development during the Ottoman rule of this area in the Middle Ages. The area continued to be commercially viable and valuable to the new rulers. The town of Praca continued to grow and expand until the great fire and outbreak of Black Death in the 18th century. The name \"Pavli Vilayet\" continued to be used for this area until the beginning of the 19th century and the town eventually came to be known as Pale. One of the earliest recordings of this new name is a map from 1877, where the town itself as well as the entire region are labelled as \"Pale\".\n\nDuring the 19th century the Ottoman Empire found itself under the two politically and socially completely different power struggles. The early decades of the 19th century were marked with a series of national and ethnic freedom movements of the many subject people. The Ottoman aristocracy on the other hand was deeply conservative and was resisting any efforts towards reform and development of a centralized state. The aristocracy in Bosnia was among the most dissatisfied in the empire, jealously guarding its right against the powers.\n\nIn 1831, Captain [[Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful members of the Bosnian aristocracy, came to lead the rebel aristocrats. After the conquest of Travnik, the seat of the Ottoman Viceroy, the Bosnian aristocracy demanded that the Sultan halt his reform efforts and keep the status quo in Bosnia. In addition they wanted the right to vote for and appoint the Viceroy from among their ranks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCaptain Hussain did not wait for the Sultan to answer their demands and appointed himself the Vice Roy of Bosnia, alienating many of his supporters in the process. The Sultan played the different factions against each other and in 1832 sent an army against the rebels. One of the decisive battles against the rebels took place in the town of Pale itself. Captain Husein did not command sufficient numbers of troops and suffered a defeat. The decisive victory broke the back of the revolt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Narrow-Gauge-Railway Ostbahn Station-Pale.jpg|thumb|left|Railway station in Pale after opening in 1906]]\nWith the [[Berlin Congress]] Bosnia was [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|placed under the administration of Austria-Hungary]]. During this time significant investment and economic changes were made in Pale and the surrounding areas.\n\nThe new overlords were favoring the exploitation of the natural resources, primarily mineral and wood products.  The town of Pale at this point becomes an important logging and wood products center in the region. According to the 1895 census, Pale with the adjacent villages had 483 inhabitants. 440 inhabitants were engaged in agricultural and logging activities while 27 were engaged in clerical work. Industrial development spurs on supporting activities. New trade shops, hotels and other service activities are brought to the town.\n\nIn February 1907 Pale receives the first Elementary School. The school was administered by the school-church board of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in Pale. The school admitted students regardless of their faith. Along with Orthodox Christians, Catholic and Jewish students also attended the school. These were mostly the children of people who were involved in the town log mill.\n\nAccording to administrative records of the Austro-Hungarian administration, by 1879 in Pale there were already two modern log mills, and their products were transported to Sarajevo.  With the construction of the rail line connecting the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo with its eastern border town [[Vi\u0161egrad]] the town of Pale received its first railway station. The railway link enabled Pale to continue to grow and prosper with foreign investment making it possible to open several additional mills in the town. Construction of the [[East Bosnian railway|Bosnian Eastern Railway]] from [[Sarajevo]] to [[Uvac, Rudo|Uvac]] and [[Donje Vardi\u0161te|Vardi\u0161te]] started in 1903. It was completed in 1906, using the {{RailGauge|760mm|lk=on}} [[track gauge]]. With the cost of 75 million gold crowns, which approximately translates to 450 thousand gold crowns per kilometer, it was one of the most expensive railways in the world built by that time. The line was closed down in 1978, and dismantled afterwards.<ref name=\"VisegradTurizam NGR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|title=Narrow-gauge railway in Vi\u0161egrad|website=visegradturizam.com|publisher=Tourist organization of Vi\u0161egrad|access-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917020046/http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|archivedate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nIn the early months of 1914 after the decisive Serbian victory at the [[Battle of Cer]] the allies requested from the Serbs and their Montenegrin allies to attack the Austro-Hungarians in Bosnia and tie up their forces there.\n\nIn October 1914 the Serbo-Montenegrin armies penetrated the areas surrounding Sarajevo and gained control of Mt. Romanija. During that operation, Montenegrin units entered Pale. Soon afterwards, the Montegrins had to withdraw. Along with them a large part of the local Serbian population.\n\nThose who were unable to flee were at the mercy of the Austrian Schutz corps, irregular Austrian police forces tasked with suppressing revolt within the empire. Pale was pillaged and burned down completely after the Austrian forces re-entered the town. 54 local residents were lynched in the town center.\n\nIn the town of [[Gora\u017ede]], a refugee column of villagers from nearby villages such as Praca, Vijara, Budj, Podgrab, Vrhpraca, Gorovici, Hotocine, Glasinac, Podromanija and Socica were intercepted by Austrian regular forces and the irregulars before they could cross the [[Drina]] river. 48 adult men were separated from the rest of the group and executed by pistol-shot, while the remaining refugees were forced into detention camps.\n\nConditions in these detention camps were especially harsh. Among the most infamous was the detention camp in [[Doboj]]. From December 1914 to July 1917 more than 45,000 people (mostly [[Serbs]]) were detained there. While the exact numbers of fatalities will probably never be known, more than 1000 fatalities were identified, 230 of which were from the Pale municipality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Post WWI===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nWith the end of the war and the absorption of Bosnia into the newly created Kingdom of [[Yugoslavia]], the town of Pale once again struck out towards growth. The basis for economic recovery and development once again, as before, were based the on the natural resources of the region, in particular forestry.\n\nNewly developed transportation links with [[Sarajevo]] spurred growth. In 1928 the town itself became the center of the municipality. By 1939 there were more than 14 log mills in Pale which generated more than {{convert|90000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. Increased economic development spurred population growth. Between 1921 and 1931 the number of inhabitants increased from 2,382 to 11,103.\n\nIn the 1930 one could already find 30 to 40 large buildings. In 1935 a modern water supply system was put into use. The town flourished culturally as well. New and old schools were renovated and built. A community center, completed in 1928, dedicated to the victims of World War I featured gymnastic equipment and from time to time cultural and entertainment events were held there. Amateur theater and folk dance companies were active there as well.\n\nIn 1934 the Vihor Football Club was founded, and along with it a new soccer stadium was constructed. The cultural and sport society \"Soko\" was responsible for a large level of participation by Pale's inhabitants in their athletic programs. The members of this club would go on to successfully compete in [[Zagreb]], [[Ljubljana]] and [[Prague]]. In this period the town also received the first medical facility as well as a library.\n\nBy the 1940 Pale already have the looks of a small, but very well arranged city. A significant number of intellectuals as well as affluent and influential people from Sarajevo and other places in the country constructed summer homes in Pale.  All of this was interrupted with the German attack on Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the conquests of Zagreb and Belgrade the German forces turned their drive towards the center of the country. On 15 April, a German motorized division would occupy Sarajevo and capture the Yugoslav Supreme Military command in the town of Pale itself. By April 1941 a complete surrender was signed. The short April war brought on a full dismemberment of the country. The town of Pale was incorporated into the Nazi-affiliated [[Independent State of Croatia]].\n\nThe first of act of the newly installed puppet regime in the town of Pale was the demolition of the World War I Victim Memorial as well the demolition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. All Serb enterprises were nationalized and taken over by Nazi sympathizers. The former home to the cultural center was turned into the HQ of the local regiment of Ustashe, which would soon serve as prison and detention center. Mass deportations, executions of prominent Serbs were daily occurrences. During the summer of 1941 the first massacres occurred, the villages of Njemanici and Bjelogorica were completely destroyed and more than sixty people were murdered.\n\nFaced with this kind of mistreatment the local populace started an armed revolt. The initial skirmishes took place in the early morning hours of 1 August 1941. The occupation forces tried to brutally suppress this revolt and during the month of August more than 75 prominent town folk were arrested and deported to death camps.\n\nIn mid-November 1943 in a retaliatory expedition the Ustashe killed more than 100 inhabitants of the village of [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]. After 45 men out of that village reported to the [[Usta\u0161e]] administration for the issuance of new identification documents they were all arrested and in pairs of two were chained to each other. They were transported and murdered. After they killed the men they went to Rakovac to kill the remaining women, children and the elderly. Once the surviving witnesses, Milan Star\u010devi\u0107, residing today in Pale, testified: ''\"After they say that a part of the village inhabitants was missing the Ustashe sent out search parties and came to the Alija Hill. There they were stopped by the Germans. The Germans did not allow them to go into the Santrac house where about 10 or so women and children had fled. There were even shots exchanged among the Ustashe and the Germans.\"''\n\nThe next day Milan Star\u010devi\u0107's brother went with German troops back to bury the victims of the Ustashe massacre. During World War II in the municipality of Pale more than 1200 civilians were murdered, while another 350 resistance fighters were killed in the fighting.\n\n===Pale after WWII===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter World War II, the town and municipality of Pale, thanks to the tireless efforts of the local population, slowly recover and resume their economic development. In 1946 on the foundations of the old log mil a new one is constructed. This new mill would produce more than {{convert|25000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. The mill itself employed more than 170 in the mill and an addition 150 in the forest.\n\nIn 1952 a military maintenance facility in the suburb of Koran was constructed. The local economy received the first important building block for the metal industry. Between 1952 and 1960 and additional 300\u2013400 employees were hired in that facility.\n\nWith the development of the metal industry there are significant migration into the town, the suburb of Koran is built out with new building and apartment complexes constructed.\n\nIn 1968 the Military Maintenance complex in Koran enters is merged with the \"FAMOS\" corporation and is incorporated as \"FAMOS-Koran\". This merger brings further development and new work opportunities. Famos-Koran would go on to manufacture parts for heavy engines, transmissions and vehicles. Towards the end of the 1980s there were more than 2000 employees at Famos-Koran. In addition factories were add for the manufacture of engine turbos and manufacture of parts for the Mercedes Benz OM-360 engine that was built under licence.\n\n===War in Bosnia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDuring 1991 and 1992, as the tensions rose in the run up to the [[Bosnian War]], the Pale region became an administrative center of the nascent anti-Sarajevo and pro-Serb [[Republika Srpska]]. It would remain a center of activity for the Serb forces during their [[Siege of Sarajevo]] which led to the deaths of more than 10,000 people and the wounding of 56,000 (including 15,000 children). Several high ranking Serb commanders in control of forces from the region, including General [[Stanislav Gali\u0107]] were sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against the people of Sarajevo where a campaign of unrelenting violence against the inhabitants was led.\n\nThe town became the nominal administrative headquarters of the Bosnian Serb government, while [[Banja Luka]] became the ''de facto'' capital. Pale remained an important cultural center with a collection of cultural and informational institutions such as a news agency (SRNA), a television station (Canal S) and newspapers (''Javnost'' and ''Ognji\u0161ta'') are based there.\n\n===Post Dayton===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nThe Bosnian War ended with the signing of the Dayton Peace accords on 14 December 1995. With the war at the end the town return to some sort of normalcy. As the [[Constitution of Republika Srpska]] sets out that [[Sarajevo]] is the capital of [[Republika Srpska]] which was recognized as an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. The administrative capital has now transferred to [[Banja Luka]].\n\nIn 2013 the local authorities and residents welcomed convicted war criminal [[Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik]] after his release from jail. In 2006, he had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for crimes against humanity on non-Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, some of which included persecution, extermination, murder and forced deportations. But his sentence was reduced and he was released early. The Municipal Board of the Serbian Democratic Party prepared the welcome which was attended by 3,000 Serbs.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/116577/war-criminal-krajisnik-welcomed-by-serbs-in-pale |title=War criminal Krajisnik welcomed by Serbs in Pale &#124; Balkans &#124; Worldbulletin News |publisher=Worldbulletin.net |date=2013-08-31 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bjelogorci (Pale)|Bjelogorci]]\n* [[Blju\u0161tevac]]\n* [[Bogovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdari\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdo (Pale)|Brdo]]\n* [[Brezovice (Pale)|Brezovice]]\n* [[Brnjica (Pale)|Brnjica]]\n* [[Brojni\u0107i]]\n* [[Bu\u0111]]\n* [[\u010celjadini\u0107i]]\n* [[\u010cemernica (Pale)|\u010cemernica]]\n* [[\u0106emanovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Datelji]]\n* [[Donja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Donja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gluhovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Gornja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gornje Pale]]\n* [[Gornji Pribanj]]\n* [[Gorovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gradac (Pale)|Gradac]]\n* [[Gute (Pale)|Gute]]\n* [[Hoto\u010dina]]\n* [[Jahorina (Pale)|Jahorina]]\n* [[Jasik (Pale)|Jasik]]\n* [[Jelovci]]\n* [[Kadino Selo]]\n* [[Kamenica (Pale)|Kamenica]]\n* [[Kasidoli]]\n* [[Komrani]]\n* [[Kosmaj (Pale)|Kosmaj]]\n* [[Kostre\u0161a]]\n* [[Kra\u010dule]]\n* [[Luke (Pale)|Luke]]\n* [[Mio\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Modrik]]\n* [[Mokro (Pale)|Mokro]]\n* [[Nehori\u0107i (Pale)|Nehori\u0107i]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Pavlovac (Pale)|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Petovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Podgrab]]\n* [[Podloznik]]\n* [[Podmedenik]]\n* [[Podvitez]]\n* [[Ponor (Pale)|Ponor]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Prutine]]\n* [[Pustopolje]]\n* [[Radonji\u0107i (Pale)|Radonji\u0107i]]\n* [[Rakite]]\n* [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Renovica]]\n* [[Rogou\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Rosulje (Pale)|Rosulje]]\n* [[Saice]]\n* [[Sinjevo]]\n* [[Sjetlina]]\n* [[Srednje (Pale)|Srednje]]\n* [[Stajna]]\n* [[Stambol\u010di\u0107]]\n* [[Strane (Pale)|Strane]]\n* [[Sumbulovac]]\n* [[\u0160ainovi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ip (Pale)|\u0160ip]]\n* [[Turkovi\u0107i (Pale)|Turkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ude\u017e]]\n* [[Vinograd]]\n* [[Vlahovi\u0107i (Pale)|Vlahovi\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| type = \n| percentages = pagr\n|1971|16119 |1991|14480 |2013|20909\n}}\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 20,909 inhabitants.
