It formally incorporated in 1969.\n\nAt the 2000 census, there were 643 people, 145 households, and 113 families residing in the city.<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> The population density was 105.5 people per square mile (40.7/km\u00b2). There were 160 housing units at an average density of 26.2 per square&nbsp;mile (10.1/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 95.33% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 4.35% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 0.16% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], and 0.16% from other races.\n\nOf the 145 households 55.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.7% were married couples living together, 15.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.4% were non-families. 16.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 0.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.43 and the average family size was 5.22.\n\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 36.1% under the age of 18, 13.2% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 16.5% from 45 to 64, and 5.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 115.2 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $23,438, and the median income for a family was $27,917. Males had a median income of $30,500 versus $29,167 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $7,725. About 29.3% of families and 29.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 40.6% of those under age 18 and 9.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\nSt. Lawrence Island has been inhabited sporadically for the past 2,000 years by both Alaskan [[Yup'ik]] and [[Siberian Yupik]] people. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the island had a population of about 4,000 in numerous villages.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1880, a famine devastated the island's population. Many who did not starve left. The remaining population of St. Lawrence Island was nearly all Siberian Yupik.\n\nIn 1900, [[reindeer]] were introduced on the island and by 1917, the herd had grown to over 10,000 animals. A reindeer camp was established near present-day Savoonga in 1916. The village of Savoonga was established near the camp in the 1930s. Good hunting and trapping in the area attracted more residents.\n\nGambell and Savoonga received joint title to most of the land on St. Lawrence Island under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Asof|2013}}, 25% of the adults in the community had no jobs. Of those who did, 37% worked for the school system. Other jobs involved air transportation, fishing, and the oil industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garland, Sarah|url=http://hechingerreport.org/in-remote-alaskan-villages-teachers-struggle-to-make-school-meaningful/ |title=In remote Alaskan villages, teachers struggle to make school meaningful |publisher=[[The Hechinger Report]] |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2017-02-14}} - [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/in-remote-alaskan-villages-teachers-struggle-to-make-school-meaningful/273596/ Also published in] ''[[The Atlantic]]''</ref>\n\n==Education==\nSavoonga is served by the [[Bering Strait School District]].

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the island had a population of about 4,000 in numerous villages.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1880, a famine devastated the island's population. Many who did not starve left. The remaining population of St. Lawrence Island was nearly all Siberian Yupik.\n\nIn 1900, [[reindeer]] were introduced on the island and by 1917, the herd had grown to over 10,000 animals. A reindeer camp was established near present-day Savoonga in 1916. The village of Savoonga was established near the camp in the 1930s. Good hunting and trapping in the area attracted more residents.\n\nGambell and Savoonga received joint title to most of the land on St. Lawrence Island under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Asof|2013}}, 25% of the adults in the community had no jobs. Of those who did, 37% worked for the school system. Other jobs involved air transportation, fishing, and the oil industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garland, Sarah|url=http://hechingerreport.org/in-remote-alaskan-villages-teachers-struggle-to-make-school-meaningful/ |title=In remote Alaskan villages, teachers struggle to make school meaningful |publisher=[[The Hechinger Report]] |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2017-02-14}} - [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/in-remote-alaskan-villages-teachers-struggle-to-make-school-meaningful/273596/ Also published in] ''[[The Atlantic]]''</ref>\n\n==Education==\nSavoonga is served by the [[Bering Strait School District]].
