Cornwall is Ontario's easternmost city, located on the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor]] along [[Ontario Highway 401]], and is the [[urban area|urban]] centre for surrounding communities, including [[South Stormont|Long Sault]] and Ingleside to the west, [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] Territory of [[Akwesasne]] to the south, St. Andrew's and Avonmore to the north, and Glen Walter, Martintown, Apple Hill, Williamstown, and Lancaster to the east.\n\nCornwall lies on the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]], approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Ottawa]],  the national [[Capital (political)|capital]], {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Montreal]], Quebec's largest city, and {{convert|440|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Toronto, the provincial capital and Canada's largest city.  It is named after the English [[Duchy of Cornwall]]; the City's [[coat of arms]] is based on that of the duchy with its colours reversed and the addition of a \"royal [[tressure]]\", a Scottish symbol of royalty.\n\nIts largest industries include logistics distribution and call centres.\n\n==Historical overview==\nAboriginal peoples have lived in and around the area of present-day Cornwall for millennia.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThough accounts suggest Europeans filtered into the area and had scattered settlements for some time, the first documented European settlement was established in 1784 by [[United Empire Loyalists]], primarily from the former British colony of New York.  After the war for American independence, former colonial soldiers loyal to the Crown and other disbanded soldiers and their families began to settle at the site of Cornwall, then called New Johnstown.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\">{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/plaques/founding-of-cornwall |title=Founding of Cornwall, The |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust }}</ref> Many of the new arrivals were of German origin, with the town being named for [[Johnstown, New York]] where many came from.\n\nThe main group were led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson and were soldiers from the First Battalion King's Royal Regiment of New York and a contingent of the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants.  Following the success of rebellious colonists in the [[American Revolution]], many of those on afraid for their lives or uncomfortable in the newly independent United States would become \"United Empire Loyalists\", as they were later called, and migrated to Canada.  The British government helped them settle throughout the Canadas as a reward for their loyalty and to compensate them for their losses in the United States. One of the chief settlement regions was the St Lawrence River valley, from Kingston to Cornwall, which would later be known as \"loyalist country\".\n\nThey founded a settlement on the site formerly called ''Pointe Maligne'' by French colonists and renamed it \"Royal Settlement #2\", and, later, \"New Johnstown\".  It was later renamed Cornwall by the British for the [[Duke of Cornwall]] by proclamation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], and in 1834 the town became one of the first incorporated municipalities in the British colony of [[Upper Canada]].<ref>[http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/ca-on-co.html 5 Star Flags]</ref>  The construction of the [[Cornwall Canal]] between 1834 and 1842 accelerated the community's development into a regional and industrial economic \"capital\" for a growing hinterland of towns and villages.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\"/><ref name=\"ParhamGreatWilderness\">{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Claire Puccia|title=From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns: A Comparative History of Cornwall, Ontario, and Massena, New York, 1784-2001|date=2013|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791485676|page=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the population was about 1,600 and there were many brick and stone houses as well as a stone courthouse and jail. Several government offices were located here. There was little industry, except for a foundry and two tanneries, but many independent tradesmen of various types worked there. Other amenities included two bank agencies, eight taverns and a ladies' school.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Railway connections, beginning in the 1850s, provided connections between Cornwall and local communities that required access to public services in Cornwall itself, such as high schools and medical services, and helped cement Cornwall's position as a regional centre for a large, rapidly expanding and increasingly populated rural hinterland .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lostvillages.ca/history/the-lost-villages/mille-roches/ |title=Mille Roches |publisher=The Lost Villages Historical Society |accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref> The network of villages and towns surrounding Cornwall helped make the city a local entrepot for business, commerce, media and services.\n\nIn 1944, the city was rocked by the magnitude 5.8 [[1944 Cornwall\u2013Massena earthquake|Cornwall\u2013Massena earthquake]]. There were no deaths or injuries reported, but several chimneys were destroyed or damaged, along with heavy damage to historical masonry structures. For example, the [[Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School]] received heavy damage from masonry work falling through the roof of the gymnasium.\n\nSituated west of Cornwall along the [[St. Lawrence River]] were several smaller communities.  Now known as [[the Lost Villages]], the communities were permanently flooded in 1958 during the construction of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] as the massive [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] at the western end of the city required a reservoir. The villages were flooded when it was filled. Much of the Cornwall region's local character also changed at this time.\n\n==Ethnic history==\nEastern Ontario has always been a highway or corridor through which people moved, a corridor used by migration and conquest.  Prior to European colonization, the Mohawks and Six Nations [[Iroquois]] settled, raided and battled through the St. Lawrence valley.<ref>[[Akwesasne#History]]</ref>  The French and British fought over the waterway, often using and being used by native allies in highly complex economic competition. Later, after thirteen of the British colonies declared independence and became the United States, during the [[War of 1812]], it became a battleground between Americans and the people who would become today's Canadians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.choosecornwall.ca/live-in-cornwall/history/cornwall-and-the-war-of-1812/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819103141/http://www.choosecornwall.ca/live-in-cornwall/history/cornwall-and-the-war-of-1812/ |publisher=Choose Cornwall |title=Cornwall and the War of 1812 |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Formally founded to be a new home for refugees from the American Revolution, it remained a home for refugees and migrants for much of its history.\n\nEarly settlement of the region is largely undocumented although oral histories and early accounts suggest that European settlers, traders and farmers lived in the area long before formal state recognition, and had been interacting with the native population for most of that time.\n\nThe post-contact regional population was a mixture of [[French Canadian]], [[Ojibwe]] and [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] residents.  To this mix was added an influx of American English Loyalists and refugees from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (now the United States), other French Canadian and [[Acadian]] migrants and, later, poor Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees who arrived from overseas and from other parts of Canada.  These different groups mixed and integrated over time, with family names and histories reflecting a blending of different backgrounds that became typical of Eastern Ontario.<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60871.pdf |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |title=The  Early  Settlement  of  Cornwall, Ontario  and  Massena,  New  York, 1784\u20131834 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611191042/http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60871.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/english.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308062404/http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/english.htm |publisher=Ontario Archaeology Society |title=The English Period (A.D. 1760 to 1867) |archive-date=March 8, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSmaller but nevertheless impressive contributions in the region were made by a host of other migrants, from Jewish traders, craftsmen and merchants, to Eastern European refugees and even a significant body of former slaves.

Most of these former slaves settled and integrated into the same communities where they were freed.  By 1833, this process of liberation had succeeded throughout the Empire and all slaves in the British Empire were free. The British Empire was the first major state in world history to abolish slavery, and Ontario was the place where this process first bore fruit.

In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the British authorities split the [[Province of Canada]] in 1791 into two, Upper Canada for English settlers fleeing persecution in the United States and Lower Canada for the French (later, Ontario and Quebec). This was designed to accommodate Loyalists who had fled post-war reprisals and persecution in the new United States, though the 5,000 English-speaking settlers in the Eastern Township of Quebec were allowed to stay in the French-speaking area and many French settlers moved into Ontario. Along with the area's original inhabitants, this made the area a patchwork of intersecting ethnicities that would end up blending to a great degree.  Cornwall and the surrounding area, originally called \"Royal Settlement #2\" and then \"New Jamestown\", was initially a rough place and was largely left to its own devices.  According to contemporary reports, this bred a local culture of intense self-reliance.  Adding to this initial history of pragmatic entrepreneurialism, beginning very early with the founding of the city, provincial and federal governments have typically neglected the area, treating it as little more than a transit corridor. Those who remained in the region tended to be those who had the fortitude and energy to survive on their own, with little outside assistance.\n\n\"The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation.  Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, Loyalists were given a tent, one month's worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders.  They were promised one cow for every two families, an axe, and other necessary tools in the near future. For the next three years, bateaux (boat) crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for themselves.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\nThe region's energetic spirit of enterprise and fortitude was well known in the 19th century.  [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], the Welsh-Canadian explorer who mapped the Far West and was called the greatest land geographer in history, drew many of his traveling companions from Cornwall's rural hinterland, drawing on Scottish and native settlers, and himself lived in Williamstown.<ref>[[David Thompson (explorer)]]</ref>\n\nMore recently, Cornwall has seen an increase in the arrival of new immigrants,<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/canada/Cornwall-City-citizenship.html  Population, Age characteristics, Dwellings, Houses, Language, Education, Work, Industry, Earnings, Income, Immigration, Citizenship, Labor<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}</ref> who tend to integrate and often fare better than immigrants in other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |publisher=Eastern Ontario Training Board |title=Update on Cornwall's Economy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813042036/http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |archive-date=August 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Historical integration==\nThe Cornwall region was unusually integrated for rural counties in Ontario.  For hundreds of years, the local population has been characterized by a mix of economic migrants, refugees and opportunists.  Mixing of different social classes and ethnic backgrounds was common even early in its history, due to the interdependence demanded by isolation and the lack of either support from or interference by official authorities.\n\nThe original Native population was remarkably welcoming, and the Iroquois were especially well known for integrating newcomers into local societies and for adapting to change as it happened.  Many people in the region have some Native ancestry as a result, and many communities sit on sites that have been occupied, farmed or managed for hundreds of years. While some people were pushed out, others simply blended into new communities in a process that would go on continuously over many generations.\n\nLack of strict hierarchy was a characteristic of the region. For example, during the 1780s\u20131830s, a \"Bee\" was a social event that pooled local labour resources, when people would come together for collective projects or to help out individual families, and was often a festive occasion.  These early \"Bees\" presaged the development of a varied and integrated culture that ultimately drew on many different classes, backgrounds and ethnic and linguistic groups, all of whom were forced by the harsh reality of life in the region to work together for common goals, the primary of which was survival.  These \"Bees\" and different forms of collective, shared labour were extremely common in Eastern Ontario generally, and especially so in the early villages of the St. Lawrence valley.\n\n\"In her book \"Roughing It in the Bush\", Susanna Moodie observed that \"people in the woods, have a craze for giving and going to bees and run to them with as much eagerness as a peasant runs to a race.\" Bees often involved all ranks and nationalities of society.  Thomas Need, a sawmill operator in Victoria County, described in From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns the raising of his facility in 1834 in the following way:  \"They assembled in great force and all worked together in great harmony and good will not with- standing their different stations in life.\"  These gatherings exhibited the lack of aristocracy in the rural loyalist settlement along the St. Lawrence River and residents' disregard for individuals' former social standing or lineage... The harshness and isolation of frontier living prevented the development of an aristocracy and, instead, united all members of the community in a struggle for survival.  Early Loyalists, regardless of the amount of land they owned, depended upon the help of their neighbors to clear land, build homes, and share supplies and food during times of poor harvests.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1986 | 46425\n|1991 | 47137\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|47403\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|45640\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]<ref name=\"cp2006\">{{cite web |title=2006 Community Profiles: Cornwall, Ontario (city) |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=35&B1=All&Custom= |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>|45965\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]<ref name=\"cp2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=CD&Code2=3501&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Cornwall census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>|46340\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]<ref name=\"census2016\"/>|46,589}}\n\nAs of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=Canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=1|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Cornwall, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Canada [Country]|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Cornwall has a population of 46,589, an increase of 0.5% from 2011.

With the completion of the new low-level bridge connecting Cornwall to Cornwall Island, the C.B.S.A. port was moved to a permanent temporary facility on the canal lands.  The city is connected to the United States at Roosevelttown near the municipalities of [[Massena (village), New York|Massena, New York]] and [[Malone (village), New York|Malone, New York]], via the [[Three Nations Crossing]] (Canada, Mohawk, and United States) which traverses the St. Lawrence River.\n\nCornwall was once home to a thriving [[cotton]] processing industry.  Courtaulds Canada, Inc.'s rayon manufacturing mill operated until 1992; at one point it employed nearly 3,000 people.  [[Domtar Inc.|Domtar]], a Quebec-based company, operated a paper mill in the city for nearly 100 years, ceasing operations on March 31, 2006.  At its peak, Domtar employed nearly 1,500 employees.

Further research, showed that infants under two years of age had four times the expected hospital admission rate for asthma.  Lung and male rectal cancer rates were also elevated in comparison with the rest of the province.\n\nThe shutdown of the Courtaulds rayon fiber operation (1992) and the Domtar paper mill (2006) have been a significant factor in the City's improved air quality.  Cornwall now consistently ranks in the top 10 of 40 monitored communities across Ontario.  More recently, a Pembina Institute study of 29 communities across Ontario looked at a number of environmental, social and economic factors.  Cornwall ranked 13th overall, and its air quality was ranked #1 in the province.\n\nCornwall was at one point one of only two cities left in the Province of Ontario with only primary sewage treatment facilities.  But construction was started in May 2012 on the secondary treatment level plant with the Governments of Canada and Ontario each covering one-third of an estimated $55.5 million construction cost.  The City picked up the remaining one-third of the cost of $18.5 million.  The secondary treatment level plant was completed in November 2014.\n\nIn 2006, the City updated its Strategic Plan, including the objective to develop an environmentally-sustainable community. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 2007, a former city councillor, Naresh Bhargava, began working with the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences on a project called the Community Carbon Reduction Initiative.  City Council provided $5,000 in start-up funding for the project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Earlier, progress in energy conservation was made in the 1990s when a co-generation plant went into operation that provides 4% to 6% of the City's daily electrical needs while at the same time heating a number of buildings, including both hospital sites.  Cornwall also converted all of its traffic signals in 2002 to energy efficient LEDs that have reduced power usage by more than 600,000&nbsp;kW\u2014enough to light close to 70 homes.

Crossing.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The north span of the [[Three Nations Crossing]] seen from Cornwall's west end.  This bridge is being torn down as it has been replaced by a much shorter low-level bridge to Cornwall Island.]]\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (now [[CN Rail]]) built an east-west line through Cornwall in 1856, and its original station dated to that year. The [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] (NY&O) followed with a north-south line crossing the St. Lawrence, with a station in Cornwall dating to 1898.<ref name=canada-rail>{{cite web |url=https://www.canada-rail.com/ontario/c2/cornwall.html |title=Railway Stations in Cornwall Ontario |website=Canada-Rail.com |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref> [[CP Rail|Canadian Pacific]] created a succession of subsidiaries and plans for a Cornwall line starting in the 1880s, culminating in the [[Glengarry and Stormont Railway]] in 1915, which connected to CP's [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] mainline to the northeast, creating an alternative route to Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThe expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s significantly disrupted the city's rail infrastructure, resulting in CN relocating its line northward, and the NY&O abandoning its line altogether. A new CN passenger station, which is still in use today by [[Via Rail]], was constructed in 1957 and the century-old Grand Trunk station was demolished shortly after, in 1962. The NY&O's passenger service ended in 1957 and its passenger station was demolished in the 1960s as well.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP passenger service ended even earlier, in 1952, and the CP passenger station was demolished in 1969.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP abandoned the line altogether in 1995.\n\nCurrently, Cornwall only has one significant rail line, the CN Kingston Subdivision, which functions as the CN mainline between Toronto and Montreal. It also serves as a component of Via Rail's [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Qu\u00e9bec City-Windsor corridor]]. Via Corridor passenger trains between [[Montr\u00e9al]] and [[Toronto]] stop at the [[Cornwall railway station]], which is located in the city's north end. Via's [[Via Rail#High Frequency Rail Project (HFR)|High-Frequency Rail]] (HFR) proposal, which would generally improve passenger rail service in Eastern Ontario, would leave Cornwall unaffected, as most of the service improvements are planned to be focused on new lines constructed on abandoned rail rights of way, as well as existing Via-owned lines such as the Via Brockville Subdivision.\n\n====Street railway====\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Cornwall had a burgeoning electric street railway system, which transported freight and passengers throughout the city. The '''[[Cornwall Street Railway|Cornwall Electric Street Railway]]''' began passenger operations in 1896 and freight operations in 1899. Passenger operations ended in 1949 with a switch to [[trolleybus]] service, and electric freight operations ended in 1971 with the system's sale to CN Rail and subsequent [[dieselization]].<ref name=trainweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm |title=Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company |website=Trainweb.org |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> During its time, the street railway was significant in the city's social and industrial development. Ultimately, its passenger tram service, after conversion to trolleybus, became the present-day Cornwall Transit, which provides municipal diesel bus service to this day.\n\n===Public transit===\n\nWith a fleet of 24 buses, [[Cornwall Transit]] operates 6 days per week (excluding Sundays and holidays) on fixed routes and supplementary rush hour routes.  In addition, there is an on-demand \"Handi-Transit\" service for the disabled.  Cornwall Transit also contracts taxi service at a flat rate for Handi-Transit registrants who are ambulatory.  The City-operated transit system transports approximately 860,000 passengers every year. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwall.ca/en/live-here/cornwall-transit.aspx|title=Cornwall Transit|date=2019-12-17|website=www.cornwall.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\n\nCornwall is served by the [[Cornwall Regional Airport]], which is located {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} east of the city near Summerstown. It is open year-round and licensed for day and night VFR IFR operations. The facilities include a {{convert|3500|x|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} [[runway]], a [[Airport terminal|terminal]], [[hangar]], and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (on request). Domestic and international charter flying service from the airport is offered by Cornwall Aviation.\n\n===Sea===\n\nThe City of Cornwall is on the St. Lawrence Seaway just east of the [[Eisenhower Locks|Eisenhower]] and [[Snell Locks|Snell]] [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]]. The [[Cornwall Harbour and Government wharf]] are located on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River in the city's east end.\n\n==Sports==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nCornwall has two indoor arenas, the [[Cornwall Civic Complex]] and the [[Benson Centre]] with three ice surfaces.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nCornwall has been home to a variety of sports teams, the most notable of which was the [[Cornwall Royals]] hockey team which played in both the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] before moving to [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] in 1992.  The Royals won the [[Memorial Cup]] in 1972, 1980 and 1981.\n\nBetween the years 1993\u20131996, the [[Cornwall Aces]], an [[American Hockey League|AHL]] franchise, was in town.  They were the farm team for the [[NHL]] franchise the [[Quebec Nordiques]]/[[Colorado Avalanche]].\n\nThe [[Cornwall Colts]] are the current Junior A team playing in the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].  Cornwall has hosted several major sporting events in its history including the Ontario Winter Games and Special Olympics. In 2008, Cornwall hosted the Royal Bank Cup, the National Championship for Junior A hockey teams.  The Cornwall Colts finished third in the series, winning 2 of 5 games.  The Cornwall Colts hosted the Fred Page Cup in 2015 for the Eastern Canadian Championship.  Today, the teams represented in the Fred Page Cup are the Maritime Hockey League Champions (Kent Cup), the Ligue de Hockey Junior AAA du Qu\u00e9bec Champions (Napa Cup), the Ottawa District champions of the Central Canada Hockey League (Bogart-Nielsen Cup), and a host team chosen by committee two years before the tournament.\n\nThe [[Cornwall River Kings]] of the [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH) started playing out of the Civic Complex in the fall of 2012 but folded in 2016. The River Kings were replaced by the [[Cornwall Nationals]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |title=Cornwall city hall inks deal with FHL Nationals |publisher=Standard-Freeholder |date=September 14, 2016 |access-date=September 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917084122/http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> who folded during the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n'''Competitive Swimming'''\n\nCornwall's competitive swim team is the Cornwall Sea Lions, currently under the coaching of Simon St. Pierre. Two swimmers, Hannah Riordan  and Tess Simpson competed at junior international level.  Riordan and Simpson have also represented Canada at the second FINA World Junior Championships the Tri-Nations Cup,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and Riordan competed in the Junior Pan Pacifics, and Simpson in the Australian Youth festival. Four swimmers attained scholarships at NCAA schools (Riordan \u2013 Auburn, Simpson \u2013 Texas A&M, Megan Suffel \u2013 University of New Hampshire and Claudia Dugual at Drexal).  These four swimmers all received their fastest club times while under the coaching of Robert Eynon.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''Soccer'''\n\nCornwall has three soccer areas, the Kinsmen Junior Soccer Field at Second Street West and Haulage Road; The Benson Centre (for indoor soccer); and Optimist Park on Sunnyside Street and St. Michel Drive.\n\n'''Rugby'''\n\nCornwall has competitive men's and women's rugby clubs.  After many years without rugby in the community, it saw a resurrection in 2006. Both teams compete in the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union which is located in Ottawa.  The home of the Cornwall Crusaders Rugby Football Club is Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School.  The men's and women's teams practice Tuesdays and Thursdays from April until the end of August.  The men's team has found success in recent{{when|date=January 2019}} years, winning the Eastern Ontario Men's Division 1 Championship in 2009 and 2010 against the Napanee Outlaws and the Gatineau Mirage, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe sport of rugby continues to grow in the community. Many high schools throughout Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry have junior and senior boys' teams as well as varsity girls' teams.  These high school teams serve as feeders to the Cornwall Crusaders. Many players who play on the Crusaders today come from high schools in the S.D.& G. area.\n\n'''Roller Derby'''\nThe Seaway Roller Derby Girls Association is the first roller derby flat track roller derby league in Cornwall and SD&G Counties, established in 2011. The Power Dames is the first official team.\n\n'''Girls' basketball'''\nThe United Counties girls' basketball team won provincial and international basketball tournaments in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In addition, the city offered girls' and women's basketball from age eight to college graduates.  The San Lawrence College women's team won a college tournament as well. The teams were coached by Adelore Bergeon and Alan Haskvitz.\n\n==Notable people==\nSome of the more famous people to hail from the Cornwall area include:\n* [[Barstool Prophets]], three of the four members of the Canadian rock band hailed from Cornwall, where the band had its start (Glenn Forrester, Graham Greer, Bobby Tamas)\n* [[Darby Bergin]], 1st Canadian [[Surgeon General (Canada)|Surgeon General]]\n* [[Malcolm Burn]], musician and record producer\n* [[Doug Carpenter]], former [[NHL]] coach\n* [[Alain Chevrier]], former NHL goaltender\n* [[Corbett Denneny]], former NHL player\n* [[Cy Denneny]], brother of Corbett, former NHL player, in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Lori Dupuis]], Olympic gold and silver medalist in women's ice hockey\n* [[Jacob Gallinger]], United States politician\n* [[Peter Gatien]], New York nightlife [[impresario]]\n* [[Ryan Gosling]], actor\n* [[Alan Haskvitz]], National Hall of Fame and USA Today All American Educator\n* [[Christina Julien]], current member of the Canadian national women's soccer team\n* [[Chad Kilger]], retired NHL player\n* [[Bob Kilger]], former NHL referee, former mayor, father of Chad Kilger\n* [[Ed Lalonde|Ed \"Newsy\" Lalonde]], captained the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the 1910s and helped the team win its first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1916\n* [[Donald Alexander Macdonald (general)|Donald Alexander Macdonald]], soldier\n* [[John Sandfield Macdonald]], prominent lawyer and the first Premier of Ontario\n* [[Maggie MacDonald]], playwright and musician\n* [[Don McKay]], Governor General's Award-winning poet and essayist\n* [[Duncan McNaughton]], gold medalist in the 1932 Olympics in the high jump\n* [[Ray Miron]], hockey player, coach, and executive, inducted into Cornwall Sports Hall of Fame\n* [[Scott Pearson]], former NHL player, drafted 6th overall to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1988\n* [[Nathan Phillips (politician)|Nathan Phillips]], Toronto mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontariojewisharchives.org/exhibits/osjc/communities/cornwall/earlycommunity/index.html|title=Ontario Jewish Communities {{!}} Cornwall - First Jewish Settlers|website=www.ontariojewisharchives.org|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n* [[George Beverly Shea]], noted gospel singer, associated with Billy Graham crusades\n* [[John Strachan]], 19th-century Anglican priest and influential Bishop of Toronto\n* [[Orval Tessier]], former [[NHL]] player, coach of the Chicago Blackhawks and scout\n* Colonel The Hon.

After the war for American independence, former colonial soldiers loyal to the Crown and other disbanded soldiers and their families began to settle at the site of Cornwall, then called New Johnstown.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\">{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/plaques/founding-of-cornwall |title=Founding of Cornwall, The |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust }}</ref> Many of the new arrivals were of German origin, with the town being named for [[Johnstown, New York]] where many came from.\n\nThe main group were led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson and were soldiers from the First Battalion King's Royal Regiment of New York and a contingent of the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants.  Following the success of rebellious colonists in the [[American Revolution]], many of those on afraid for their lives or uncomfortable in the newly independent United States would become \"United Empire Loyalists\", as they were later called, and migrated to Canada.  The British government helped them settle throughout the Canadas as a reward for their loyalty and to compensate them for their losses in the United States. One of the chief settlement regions was the St Lawrence River valley, from Kingston to Cornwall, which would later be known as \"loyalist country\".\n\nThey founded a settlement on the site formerly called ''Pointe Maligne'' by French colonists and renamed it \"Royal Settlement #2\", and, later, \"New Johnstown\".  It was later renamed Cornwall by the British for the [[Duke of Cornwall]] by proclamation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], and in 1834 the town became one of the first incorporated municipalities in the British colony of [[Upper Canada]].<ref>[http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/ca-on-co.html 5 Star Flags]</ref>  The construction of the [[Cornwall Canal]] between 1834 and 1842 accelerated the community's development into a regional and industrial economic \"capital\" for a growing hinterland of towns and villages.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\"/><ref name=\"ParhamGreatWilderness\">{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Claire Puccia|title=From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns: A Comparative History of Cornwall, Ontario, and Massena, New York, 1784-2001|date=2013|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791485676|page=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the population was about 1,600 and there were many brick and stone houses as well as a stone courthouse and jail.

There were no deaths or injuries reported, but several chimneys were destroyed or damaged, along with heavy damage to historical masonry structures. For example, the [[Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School]] received heavy damage from masonry work falling through the roof of the gymnasium.\n\nSituated west of Cornwall along the [[St. Lawrence River]] were several smaller communities.

The villages were flooded when it was filled. Much of the Cornwall region's local character also changed at this time.\n\n==Ethnic history==\nEastern Ontario has always been a highway or corridor through which people moved, a corridor used by migration and conquest.  Prior to European colonization, the Mohawks and Six Nations [[Iroquois]] settled, raided and battled through the St. Lawrence valley.<ref>[[Akwesasne#History]]</ref>  The French and British fought over the waterway, often using and being used by native allies in highly complex economic competition.

To this mix was added an influx of American English Loyalists and refugees from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (now the United States), other [[French Canadian]] and [[Acadian]] migrants and, later, poor Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees who arrived from overseas and from other parts of Canada.

Most of these former slaves settled and integrated into the same communities where they were freed.  By 1833, this process of liberation had succeeded throughout the Empire and all slaves in the British Empire were free. The British Empire was the first major state in world history to abolish slavery, and Ontario was the place where this process first bore fruit.

In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the British authorities split the [[Province of Canada]] in 1791 into two, Upper Canada for English settlers fleeing persecution in the United States and Lower Canada for the French (later, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]). This was designed to accommodate Loyalists who had fled post-war reprisals and persecution in the new United States, though the 5,000 English-speaking settlers in the Eastern Township of Quebec were allowed to stay in the French-speaking area and many French settlers moved into Ontario. Along with the area's original inhabitants, this made the area a patchwork of intersecting ethnicities that would end up blending to a great degree.  Cornwall and the surrounding area, originally called \"Royal Settlement #2\" and then \"New Jamestown\", was initially a rough place and was largely left to its own devices.  According to contemporary reports, this bred a local culture of intense self-reliance.  Adding to this initial history of pragmatic entrepreneurialism, beginning very early with the founding of the city, provincial and federal governments have typically neglected the area, treating it as little more than a transit corridor. Those who remained in the region tended to be those who had the fortitude and energy to survive on their own, with little outside assistance.\n\n\"The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation.  Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, Loyalists were given a tent, one month's worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders.  They were promised one cow for every two families, an axe, and other necessary tools in the near future. For the next three years, bateaux (boat) crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for themselves.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\nThe region's energetic spirit of enterprise and fortitude was well known in the 19th century.  [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], the Welsh-Canadian explorer who mapped the Far West and was called the greatest land geographer in history, drew many of his traveling companions from Cornwall's rural hinterland, drawing on Scottish and native settlers, and himself lived in Williamstown.<ref>[[David Thompson (explorer)]]</ref>\n\nMore recently, Cornwall has seen an increase in the arrival of new immigrants,<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/canada/Cornwall-City-citizenship.html  Population, Age characteristics, Dwellings, Houses, Language, Education, Work, Industry, Earnings, Income, Immigration, Citizenship, Labor<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}</ref> who tend to integrate and often fare better than immigrants in other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |publisher=Eastern Ontario Training Board |title=Update on Cornwall's Economy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813042036/http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |archive-date=August 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Historical integration==\nThe Cornwall region was unusually integrated for rural counties in Ontario.  For hundreds of years, the local population has been characterized by a mix of economic migrants, refugees and opportunists.  Mixing of different social classes and ethnic backgrounds was common even early in its history, due to the interdependence demanded by isolation and the lack of either support from or interference by official authorities.\n\nThe original Native population was remarkably welcoming, and the [[Iroquois]] were especially well known for integrating newcomers into local societies and for adapting to change as it happened.  Many people in the region have some Native ancestry as a result, and many communities sit on sites that have been occupied, farmed or managed for hundreds of years. While some people were pushed out, others simply blended into new communities in a process that would go on continuously over many generations.\n\nLack of strict hierarchy was a characteristic of the region. For example, during the 1780s\u20131830s, a \"Bee\" was a social event that pooled local labour resources, when people would come together for collective projects or to help out individual families, and was often a festive occasion.  These early \"Bees\" presaged the development of a varied and integrated culture that ultimately drew on many different classes, backgrounds and ethnic and linguistic groups, all of whom were forced by the harsh reality of life in the region to work together for common goals, the primary of which was survival.  These \"Bees\" and different forms of collective, shared labour were extremely common in Eastern Ontario generally, and especially so in the early villages of the St. Lawrence valley.\n\n\"In her book \"Roughing It in the Bush\", Susanna Moodie observed that \"people in the woods, have a craze for giving and going to bees and run to them with as much eagerness as a peasant runs to a race.\" Bees often involved all ranks and nationalities of society.  Thomas Need, a sawmill operator in Victoria County, described in From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns the raising of his facility in 1834 in the following way:  \"They assembled in great force and all worked together in great harmony and good will not with- standing their different stations in life.\"  These gatherings exhibited the lack of aristocracy in the rural loyalist settlement along the St. Lawrence River and residents' disregard for individuals' former social standing or lineage... The harshness and isolation of frontier living prevented the development of an aristocracy and, instead, united all members of the community in a struggle for survival.  Early Loyalists, regardless of the amount of land they owned, depended upon the help of their neighbors to clear land, build homes, and share supplies and food during times of poor harvests.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1986 | 46425\n|1991 | 47137\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|47403\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|45640\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]<ref name=\"cp2006\">{{cite web |title=2006 Community Profiles: Cornwall, Ontario (city) |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=35&B1=All&Custom= |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>|45965\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]<ref name=\"cp2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=CD&Code2=3501&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Cornwall census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>|46340\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]<ref name=\"census2016\"/>|46,589}}\n\nAs of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=Canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=1|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Cornwall, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Canada [Country]|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Cornwall has a population of 46,589, an increase of 0.5% from 2011.

Further research, showed that infants under two years of age had four times the expected hospital admission rate for asthma.  Lung and male rectal cancer rates were also elevated in comparison with the rest of the province.\n\nThe shutdown of the Courtaulds rayon fiber operation (1992) and the Domtar paper mill (2006) have been a significant factor in the City's improved air quality.  Cornwall now consistently ranks in the top 10 of 40 monitored communities across Ontario.  More recently, a Pembina Institute study of 29 communities across Ontario looked at a number of environmental, social and economic factors.  Cornwall ranked 13th overall, and its air quality was ranked #1 in the province.\n\nCornwall was at one point one of only two cities left in the Province of Ontario with only primary sewage treatment facilities.  But construction was started in May 2012 on the secondary treatment level plant with the Governments of Canada and Ontario each covering one-third of an estimated $55.5 million construction cost.  The City picked up the remaining one-third of the cost of $18.5 million.  The secondary treatment level plant was completed in November 2014.\n\nIn 2006, the City updated its Strategic Plan, including the objective to develop an environmentally-sustainable community. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 2007, a former city councillor, Naresh Bhargava, began working with the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences on a project called the Community Carbon Reduction Initiative.  City Council provided $5,000 in start-up funding for the project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Earlier, progress in energy conservation was made in the 1990s when a co-generation plant went into operation that provides 4% to 6% of the City's daily electrical needs while at the same time heating a number of buildings, including both hospital sites.  Cornwall also converted all of its traffic signals in 2002 to energy efficient LEDs that have reduced power usage by more than 600,000&nbsp;kW\u2014enough to light close to 70 homes.  The data were contained in a report prepared by the City's public works department.\n\n===Climate===\nSimilar to most of southern Ontario, Cornwall has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa/Dfb'') with cold, snowy winters and warm, humid summers.  Precipitation is significant year-round although the winter months are generally drier than the summer months.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cornwall, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes

This bridge is being torn down as it has been replaced by a much shorter low-level bridge to Cornwall Island.]]\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (now [[CN Rail]]) built an east-west line through Cornwall in 1856, and its original station dated to that year. The [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] (NY&O) followed with a north-south line crossing the St. Lawrence, with a station in Cornwall dating to 1898.<ref name=canada-rail>{{cite web |url=https://www.canada-rail.com/ontario/c2/cornwall.html |title=Railway Stations in Cornwall Ontario |website=Canada-Rail.com |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref> [[CP Rail|Canadian Pacific]] created a succession of subsidiaries and plans for a Cornwall line starting in the 1880s, culminating in the [[Glengarry and Stormont Railway]] in 1915, which connected to CP's [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] mainline to the northeast, creating an alternative route to Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThe expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s significantly disrupted the city's rail infrastructure, resulting in CN relocating its line northward, and the NY&O abandoning its line altogether. A new CN passenger station, which is still in use today by [[Via Rail]], was constructed in 1957 and the century-old Grand Trunk station was demolished shortly after, in 1962. The NY&O's passenger service ended in 1957 and its passenger station was demolished in the 1960s as well.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP passenger service ended even earlier, in 1952, and the CP passenger station was demolished in 1969.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP abandoned the line altogether in 1995.\n\nCurrently, Cornwall only has one significant rail line, the CN Kingston Subdivision, which functions as the CN mainline between Toronto and Montreal. It also serves as a component of [[Via Rail]]'s [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Qu\u00e9bec City-Windsor corridor]]. Via Corridor passenger trains between [[Montr\u00e9al]] and [[Toronto]] stop at the [[Cornwall railway station]], which is located in the city's north end. Via's [[Via Rail#High Frequency Rail Project (HFR)|High-Frequency Rail]] (HFR) proposal, which would generally improve passenger rail service in [[Eastern Ontario]], would leave Cornwall unaffected, as most of the service improvements are planned to be focused on new lines constructed on abandoned rail rights of way, as well as existing Via-owned lines such as the Via Brockville Subdivision.\n\n====Street railway====\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Cornwall had a burgeoning electric street railway system, which transported freight and passengers throughout the city. The '''[[Cornwall Street Railway|Cornwall Electric Street Railway]]''' began passenger operations in 1896 and freight operations in 1899. Passenger operations ended in 1949 with a switch to [[trolleybus]] service, and electric freight operations ended in 1971 with the system's sale to CN Rail and subsequent [[dieselization]].<ref name=trainweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm |title=Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company |website=Trainweb.org |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> During its time, the street railway was significant in the city's social and industrial development. Ultimately, its passenger tram service, after conversion to trolleybus, became the present-day Cornwall Transit, which provides municipal diesel bus service to this day.\n\n===Public transit===\n\nWith a fleet of 24 buses, [[Cornwall Transit]] operates 6 days per week (excluding Sundays and holidays) on fixed routes and supplementary rush hour routes.  In addition, there is an on-demand \"Handi-Transit\" service for the disabled.  Cornwall Transit also contracts taxi service at a flat rate for Handi-Transit registrants who are ambulatory.  The City-operated transit system transports approximately 860,000 passengers every year. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwall.ca/en/live-here/cornwall-transit.aspx|title=Cornwall Transit|date=2019-12-17|website=www.cornwall.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\n\nCornwall is served by the [[Cornwall Regional Airport]], which is located {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} east of the city near Summerstown. It is open year-round and licensed for day and night VFR IFR operations. The facilities include a {{convert|3500|x|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} [[runway]], a [[Airport terminal|terminal]], [[hangar]], and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (on request). Domestic and international charter flying service from the airport is offered by Cornwall Aviation.\n\n===Sea===\n\nThe City of Cornwall is on the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] just east of the [[Eisenhower Locks|Eisenhower]] and [[Snell Locks|Snell]] [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]]. The [[Cornwall Harbour and Government wharf]] are located on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River in the city's east end.\n\n==Sports==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nCornwall has two indoor arenas, the [[Cornwall Civic Complex]] and the [[Benson Centre]] with three ice surfaces.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nCornwall has been home to a variety of sports teams, the most notable of which was the [[Cornwall Royals]] hockey team which played in both the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] before moving to [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] in 1992.  The Royals won the [[Memorial Cup]] in 1972, 1980 and 1981.\n\nBetween the years 1993\u20131996, the [[Cornwall Aces]], an [[American Hockey League|AHL]] franchise, was in town.  They were the farm team for the [[NHL]] franchise the [[Quebec Nordiques]]/[[Colorado Avalanche]].\n\nThe [[Cornwall Colts]] are the current Junior A team playing in the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].  Cornwall has hosted several major sporting events in its history including the Ontario Winter Games and Special Olympics. In 2008, Cornwall hosted the Royal Bank Cup, the National Championship for Junior A hockey teams.  The Cornwall Colts finished third in the series, winning 2 of 5 games.  The Cornwall Colts hosted the Fred Page Cup in 2015 for the Eastern Canadian Championship.  Today, the teams represented in the Fred Page Cup are the Maritime Hockey League Champions (Kent Cup), the Ligue de Hockey Junior AAA du Qu\u00e9bec Champions (Napa Cup), the Ottawa District champions of the Central Canada Hockey League (Bogart-Nielsen Cup), and a host team chosen by committee two years before the tournament.\n\nThe [[Cornwall River Kings]] of the [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH) started playing out of the Civic Complex in the fall of 2012 but folded in 2016. The River Kings were replaced by the [[Cornwall Nationals]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |title=Cornwall city hall inks deal with FHL Nationals |publisher=Standard-Freeholder |date=September 14, 2016 |access-date=September 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917084122/http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> who folded during the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n'''Competitive Swimming'''\n\nCornwall's competitive swim team is the Cornwall Sea Lions, currently under the coaching of Simon St. Pierre. Two swimmers, Hannah Riordan  and Tess Simpson competed at junior international level.  Riordan and Simpson have also represented Canada at the second FINA World Junior Championships the Tri-Nations Cup,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and Riordan competed in the Junior Pan Pacifics, and Simpson in the Australian Youth festival. Four swimmers attained scholarships at NCAA schools (Riordan \u2013 Auburn, Simpson \u2013 Texas A&M, Megan Suffel \u2013 University of New Hampshire and Claudia Dugual at Drexal).  These four swimmers all received their fastest club times while under the coaching of Robert Eynon.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''Soccer'''\n\nCornwall has three soccer areas, the Kinsmen Junior Soccer Field at Second Street West and Haulage Road; The [[Benson Centre]] (for indoor soccer); and Optimist Park on Sunnyside Street and St. Michel Drive.\n\n'''Rugby'''\n\nCornwall has competitive men's and women's rugby clubs.  After many years without rugby in the community, it saw a resurrection in 2006. Both teams compete in the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union which is located in Ottawa.  The home of the Cornwall Crusaders Rugby Football Club is Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School.  The men's and women's teams practice Tuesdays and Thursdays from April until the end of August.  The men's team has found success in recent{{when|date=January 2019}} years, winning the Eastern Ontario Men's Division 1 Championship in 2009 and 2010 against the Napanee Outlaws and the Gatineau Mirage, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe sport of rugby continues to grow in the community. Many high schools throughout Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry have junior and senior boys' teams as well as varsity girls' teams.  These high school teams serve as feeders to the Cornwall Crusaders. Many players who play on the Crusaders today come from high schools in the S.D.& G. area.\n\n'''Roller Derby'''\nThe Seaway Roller Derby Girls Association is the first roller derby flat track roller derby league in Cornwall and SD&G Counties, established in 2011. The Power Dames is the first official team.\n\n'''Girls' basketball'''\nThe United Counties girls' basketball team won provincial and international basketball tournaments in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In addition, the city offered girls' and women's basketball from age eight to college graduates.  The San Lawrence College women's team won a college tournament as well. The teams were coached by Adelore Bergeon and Alan Haskvitz.\n\n==Notable people==\nSome of the more famous people to hail from the Cornwall area include:\n* [[Barstool Prophets]], three of the four members of the Canadian rock band hailed from Cornwall, where the band had its start (Glenn Forrester, Graham Greer, Bobby Tamas)\n* [[Darby Bergin]], 1st Canadian [[Surgeon General (Canada)|Surgeon General]]\n* [[Malcolm Burn]], musician and record producer\n* [[Doug Carpenter]], former [[NHL]] coach\n* [[Alain Chevrier]], former NHL goaltender\n* [[Corbett Denneny]], former NHL player\n* [[Cy Denneny]], brother of Corbett, former NHL player, in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Lori Dupuis]], Olympic gold and silver medalist in women's ice hockey\n* [[Jacob Gallinger]], United States politician\n* [[Peter Gatien]], New York nightlife [[impresario]]\n* [[Ryan Gosling]], actor\n* [[Alan Haskvitz]], National Hall of Fame and USA Today All American Educator\n* [[Christina Julien]], current member of the Canadian national women's soccer team\n* [[Chad Kilger]], retired NHL player\n* [[Bob Kilger]], former NHL referee, former mayor, father of [[Chad Kilger]]\n* [[Ed Lalonde|Ed \"Newsy\" Lalonde]], captained the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the 1910s and helped the team win its first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1916\n* [[Donald Alexander Macdonald (general)|Donald Alexander Macdonald]], soldier\n* [[John Sandfield Macdonald]], prominent lawyer and the first [[Premier of Ontario]]\n* [[Maggie MacDonald]], playwright and musician\n* [[Don McKay]], Governor General's Award-winning poet and essayist\n* [[Duncan McNaughton]], gold medalist in the 1932 Olympics in the high jump\n* [[Ray Miron]], hockey player, coach, and executive, inducted into Cornwall Sports Hall of Fame\n* [[Scott Pearson]], former NHL player, drafted 6th overall to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1988\n* [[Nathan Phillips (politician)|Nathan Phillips]], Toronto mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontariojewisharchives.org/exhibits/osjc/communities/cornwall/earlycommunity/index.html|title=Ontario Jewish Communities {{!}} Cornwall - First Jewish Settlers|website=www.ontariojewisharchives.org|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n* [[George Beverly Shea]], noted gospel singer, associated with Billy Graham crusades\n* [[John Strachan]], 19th-century Anglican priest and influential Bishop of Toronto\n* [[Orval Tessier]], former [[NHL]] player, coach of the Chicago Blackhawks and scout\n* Colonel The Hon.
