E. Strzelecki - Gippsland\n\nThe township of [[Bass, Victoria|Bass]] was surveyed and colonised in the early 1860s.\n\nThe intensive colonisation of south Gippsland began late in the 1870s. A story of that process is told in, ''The land of the Lyre Bird'' (1920).<ref>''The land of the Lyre Bird: a story of early settlement in the Great South Forest of South Gippsland; being a description of the big scrub in its virgin state with its birds and animals, and of the adventures and hardships of its early explorers and prospectors also accounts by the settlers of clearing, settlement and development of the country'', Gordon & Gotch for the Committee of the South Gippsland Pioneers Association, Melbourne, 1920 (reprinted 1966).</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{stack|{{Regions of Gippsland}}}}\n[[Image:East Gippsland old growth 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|Old growth forests in [[East Gippsland]]]]\nGippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main sub{{endash}}regions or districts:\n*[[West Gippsland]] (roughly equivalent to the Shires of Cardinia and Baw Baw)\n*[[South Gippsland]] (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires)\n*the [[Latrobe Valley]] (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north)\n*[[East Gippsland]] (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland).\n*Sometimes a fifth region, [[Central Gippsland]] (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the [[Gippsland Lakes]] and [[Yarram]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n[[File:VM 0267 Stratford - Avon River valley.jpg|thumb|On the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] near [[Stratford, Victoria|Stratford]]]]\nThe climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], where annual rainfall can be less than {{convert|600|mm|in}}. In the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] annual rainfall can be as high as {{convert|1500|mm|in}}, while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels \u2013 much of it falling as [[snow]]. In lower levels east of the [[Snowy River]], mean annual rainfall is typically about {{convert|900|\u2013|950|mm|in}} and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from {{convert|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in July. In the highlands of the [[Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau]] and the remote [[Errinundra National Park|Errinundra Plateau]], temperatures range from a maximum of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to a minimum of {{Convert|8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as {{convert|-4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October.\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n{{See also|Energy in Victoria}}\n[[Image:Potato field through fence - Thorpdale.JPG|thumb|Potato farming in the [[Thorpdale, Victoria|Thorpdale]] region]]\nThe soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being profoundly deficient in [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]. Apart from frequently [[flood]]ed areas, they are classed as [[Spodosols]], [[Psamment]]s and [[Ultisols]]. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development. Despite this, parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the [[Monaro Tableland]] used for grazing [[cattle|beef cattle]].\n\nGippsland possesses very few deposits of [[metal]]lic [[mineral]]s ([[gold]] rushes in the nineteenth century around [[Foster, Victoria|Foster]], [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]] petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty-year period between 1863-1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world's largest [[brown coal]] deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the [[Bass Strait]], some of the largest deposits of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Australia.\n\nLike the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no [[upwelling]] due to the warm currents in the [[Tasman Sea]]. Nonetheless, towns such as [[Marlo, Victoria|Marlo]] and [[Mallacoota]] depended for a long time on the fishing of [[abalone]], whose [[shell (animal)|shells]] could fetch very high prices because of their use for [[pearl]]s and pearl inlays.\n\n== Administration ==\n\n=== Political representation ===\nFor [[Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections]] for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the electoral divisions of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/flinders.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Flinders (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> [[Division of McMillan|McMillan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/mcmillan.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of McMillan (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> and [[Division of Gippsland|Gippsland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/gippsland.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Gippsland (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region.

E. Strzelecki - Gippsland\n\nThe township of [[Bass, Victoria|Bass]] was surveyed and colonised in the early 1860s.\n\nThe intensive colonisation of south Gippsland began late in the 1870s. A story of that process is told in, ''The land of the Lyre Bird'' (1920).<ref>''The land of the Lyre Bird: a story of early settlement in the Great South Forest of South Gippsland; being a description of the big scrub in its virgin state with its birds and animals, and of the adventures and hardships of its early explorers and prospectors also accounts by the settlers of clearing, settlement and development of the country'', Gordon & Gotch for the Committee of the South Gippsland Pioneers Association, Melbourne, 1920 (reprinted 1966).</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{stack|{{Regions of Gippsland}}}}\n[[Image:East Gippsland old growth 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|Old growth forests in [[East Gippsland]]]]\nGippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main sub{{endash}}regions or districts:\n*[[West Gippsland]] (roughly equivalent to the Shires of Cardinia and Baw Baw)\n*[[South Gippsland]] (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires)\n*the [[Latrobe Valley]] (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north)\n*[[East Gippsland]] (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland).\n*Sometimes a fifth region, [[Central Gippsland]] (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the [[Gippsland Lakes]] and [[Yarram]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n[[File:VM 0267 Stratford - Avon River valley.jpg|thumb|On the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] near [[Stratford, Victoria|Stratford]]]]\nThe climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], where annual rainfall can be less than {{convert|600|mm|in}}. In the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] annual rainfall can be as high as {{convert|1500|mm|in}}, while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels \u2013 much of it falling as [[snow]]. In lower levels east of the [[Snowy River]], mean annual rainfall is typically about {{convert|900|\u2013|950|mm|in}} and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from {{convert|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in July. In the highlands of the [[Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau]] and the remote [[Errinundra National Park|Errinundra Plateau]], temperatures range from a maximum of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to a minimum of {{Convert|8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as {{convert|-4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October.\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n{{See also|Energy in Victoria}}\n[[Image:Potato field through fence - Thorpdale.JPG|thumb|Potato farming in the [[Thorpdale, Victoria|Thorpdale]] region]]\nThe soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being profoundly deficient in [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]. Apart from frequently [[flood]]ed areas, they are classed as [[Spodosols]], [[Psamment]]s and [[Ultisols]]. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development. Despite this, parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the [[Monaro Tableland]] used for grazing [[cattle|beef cattle]].\n\nGippsland possesses very few deposits of [[metal]]lic [[mineral]]s ([[gold]] rushes in the nineteenth century around [[Foster, Victoria|Foster]], [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]] petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty-year period between 1863-1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world's largest [[brown coal]] deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the [[Bass Strait]], some of the largest deposits of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Australia.\n\nLike the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no [[upwelling]] due to the warm currents in the [[Tasman Sea]]. Nonetheless, towns such as [[Marlo, Victoria|Marlo]] and [[Mallacoota]] depended for a long time on the fishing of [[abalone]], whose [[shell (animal)|shells]] could fetch very high prices because of their use for [[pearl]]s and pearl inlays.\n\n== Administration ==\n\n=== Political representation ===\nFor [[Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections]] for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the electoral divisions of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/flinders.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Flinders (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> [[Division of McMillan|McMillan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/mcmillan.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of McMillan (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> and [[Division of Gippsland|Gippsland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/gippsland.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Gippsland (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region.
