The park contains the '''Baw-Baw Plateau''' and borders the [[Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort]].\n\nGeographically, the Baw-Baw Plateau is a [[plateau]] of several peaks that includes Mount Baw Baw, [[Mount St Gwinear]], Mount St Phillack, Mount Erica and Mount Whitelaw; all largely [[subalpine]] terrane outcrops of weathered [[granite]] boulders dot the plateau with [[alpine meadow]]s punctuated by stands of [[Eucalyptus pauciflora|snow-gum]].
