{"title_page": "Names for the human species", "text_new": "The [[common name]] of the [[Human|human species]] in English is historically ''[[Man (word)|man]]'' (from [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/mann-|Germanic]]), often replaced by the Latinate ''[[:wikt:human|human]]'' (since the 16th century).\n\nIn addition to the generally accepted [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic name]] ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ([[Latin]]: \"[[Self-awareness|sapient]] man\",  [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] 1758), other Latin-based '''names for the human species''' have been created to refer to various aspects of the human character.\n\nSome of these are ironic of the self-ascribed nobility immanent in the choice of ''sapiens'', others are serious references to [[human universal]]s that may be considered defining characteristics of the species. Most of these refer to  [[origin of language|linguistic]], [[intellect]]ual, [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[aesthetic]], [[social behavior|social]] or [[technology|technological]] abilities taken to be unique to humanity.\n\n==In the world's languages==\n{{further|Man (word)|Mannus|Manu (Hinduism)}}\n{{wiktionary|human_being#Translations}}\nThe [[Indo-European languages]] have a number of inherited terms for mankind. \nThe etymon of ''[[Man (word)|man]]'' is found in the Germanic languages, and is cognate with ''[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'', the name of the [[List of protoplasts|human progenitor]] in Hindu mythology, and found in Indic terms for \"man\" (''manu\u1e63ya, manush, manava'' etc.).\n\nLatin ''homo'' is derived from an Indo-European root ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/\u01f5\u02b0m\u1e53|d\u02b0\u01f5\u02b0m-]]'' \"earth\", as it were  \"earthling\". It has cognates in Baltic (Old Prussian ''zm\u016bi''),  Germanic (Gothic ''guma'') and Celtic (Old Irish ''duine'').\nThis is comparable to the explanation given in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]] narrative to the Hebrew ''[[Adam]]'' (\u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd) \"man\", derived from a word for \"red, reddish-brown\".
