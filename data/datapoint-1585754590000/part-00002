It was the first institution in Europe that provided an opportunity for women to acquire higher medical education.\n\nSoon after the founding, the Women\u2019s Medical Institute (WMI) became a reputable institution and represented a recognized model for higher medical education and medical science. Clinics and departments of the WMI developed and implemented the most advanced methods of diagnostics and treatment.\n\nUniversity has changed a few names since the time of its foundation: the Women\u2019s Medical Institute of St. Petersburg (1918), The First Medical Institute of Leningrad, also known as \u00abthe 1st Med\u00bb(1924). This name went down in history of St. Petersburg and Russian medicine. In 1936 the First Medical Institute was named in honor of the Nobel Prize winner Academician I.P. Pavlov.  In 1994 the First Medical Institute was reorganized into a medical university that received its present name.\n\nIn the 1930s the Institute of Chemistry and Pharmacy as well as the Institute of Pediatrics were detached from the First Medical Institute and established as independent units. In the meantime construction of new units and laboratory buildings were already in the design phase but the Second World War interfered with fulfilling that plan.  \nDuring heroic wartime defense of Leningrad the Institute did not cease to provide patient care, education and research; many of its graduates went to war. In honor of those killed in battle.. In 1987 a monument in honor of the fallen doctors was erected in the Institute Park, in the very same place where an unexploded bomb had been found.\nThe 1960s\u20131980s were marked by a large-scale construction of new academic buildings, hostels, research laboratories, thus, \u2018the 1st Med\u2019 gained its present-day appearance.\nIn the 1990s, a number of departments evolved into Research Institutes.\nToday the University continues to advance patient care, medical education and science.\n\n'''\u00abOur surgeons continued operating to the sounds of enemy airplanes, anti-aircraft gun shots and mine blasts\u00bb'''.\n''I.D. Strashun, Director of the 1st LMI (1941-1943)''\n\n== Historical facts ==\n\n- The first educational institution in Europe, where women could get a medical degree.\n\n- The Institute was proud to have a number of outstanding women scientists as members of the Institute staff: Anna Akimovna Sakhnovskaya, the first woman in the world to be appointed a full Professor of Medicine, was the Head of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology. Olga Nikolaevna Podvysotskaya, who also carried out research in Dermatovenereology, was the first woman to hold the rank of an Academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (since 1944), and the first female  Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (since 1939).\n\n- In 1908 Professor Michael Isaevich Nemenov opened one of the first X-ray rooms in Russia at the Clinic of Faculty Surgery. The first in Europe State Institute of Roentgenology-Radiology and Oncology was established ten years later, in 1918.\n\n- Private capital of family of Lydia Shanyavskaya constituted the financial foundation of the Institute. Lydia Shanyavskayawas an eminent activist of a public movement for equal rights for women. A big donation was made by Martha Nobel-Oleynikova, a graduate of the WMI, a member of the famous Nobel family.\n\n- In 1916 male students were allowed to attend classes at the Institute. The Academic Board was granted the right to award academic degrees to male doctors.\n\n- The USSR\u2019s first Research Institute of Pulmonology was founded in 1967.\n\n- Pavlov First St. Petersburg State Medical University is the only higher medical school in the city that has a polyclinic attached to the University.

In the meantime construction of new units and laboratory buildings were already in the design phase but the Second World War interfered with fulfilling that plan.  \nDuring heroic wartime defense of Leningrad the Institute did not cease to provide patient care, education and research; many of its graduates went to war. In honor of those killed in battle.. In 1987 a monument in honor of the fallen doctors was erected in the Institute Park, in the very same place where an unexploded bomb had been found.\nThe 1960s\u20131980s were marked by a large-scale construction of new academic buildings, hostels, research laboratories, thus, \u2018the 1st Med\u2019 gained its present-day appearance.\nIn the 1990s, a number of departments evolved into Research Institutes.\nToday the University continues to advance patient care, medical education and science.\n\n'''\u00abOur surgeons continued operating to the sounds of enemy airplanes, anti-aircraft gun shots and mine blasts\u00bb'''.\n''I.D.
