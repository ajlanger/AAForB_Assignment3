In 1870 the Harbour Board funded the installation of a slipway.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== The RNLI station ===\nIn 1865<ref name=PERIL/> the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] took over the lifeboat cover for Shoreham Harbour. They established a station with a boathouse constructed on Kingston beach. This boathouse was used until 1892<ref name=PERIL/> when a new timber framed boathouse was built near the coastguard station on Shoreham beach on the western side of the Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> The old station building at Kingston beach was demolished.\n\nIn 1903 the boathouse was moved further from the shore and was in use until 1924.<ref name=PERIL/> In October of that year the station had to be closed due to the silting up of the harbour entrance, which had made operations hazardous and then impossible. The station did not re-open until October 1929 after work had been carried out to remove the sandbar across the harbour entrance.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== New Boathouse ===\nIn 1933 the station moved into new facilities at Kingston Beach opposite Shoreham Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> This boathouse and slipway was specifically built to accommodate a new lifeboat, the 41&nbsp;ft {{Lbc|Watson}} {{RNLB|Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn|ON 758}}.<ref name=DLS>{{cite web|title=RNLB Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn now Dowager|url= http://www.adls.org.uk/t1/content/rosa-woodd-and-phyllis-lunn-now-dowager-0|publisher=All content copyright 2009 - 2014 Association of Dunkirk Little Ships|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> This lifeboat was at Shoreham for 30 years and during that period the lifeboat was launched 244 times and saved 143 lives. Over the years since that boathouse was constructed it has undergone alterations on several occasions to accommodate different lifeboats sent to serve at the station. Problems with sinkage of the slipway led to the decision to allocate a 13-ton {{Lbc|Rother}} lifeboat (primarily designed for carriage launching) to the station in 1981. However, the slipway was strengthened following the decision to place a {{Lbc|Tyne}} boat on station and the Rother was replaced in 1986 by the first of two {{Lbc|47ft Watson}} boats that served for four years before being replaced by the new Tyne. In 1967 the station was supplied with a second lifeboat. This was a {{Lbc|D|EA16}} inshore lifeboat and was kept in its own berth constructed beneath the main boathouse.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n===''Tyne''-class lifeboat ===\nIn 1990 the station was supplied with a new {{Lbc|Tyne}} lifeboat. She was the {{RNLB|Hermione Lady Colwyn|ON 1158}}.<ref name=NAVNUTYNE>{{cite web|title=Tyne-class 47 foot Lifeboat|url=http://www.lifeboatsonline.com/RNLITyne.html|work=List of Tyne-class lifeboats, includes ON-1158|publisher =Lifeboat World On-Line\u00a9 2014|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' was on station from 1990 until 2010 and during that period she was launched to service 414<ref name=ON1158>{{cite web|title= The vessel - Odin Nautical \u2013 Tyne Class Lifeboat|url=http://www.aegirnautical.com/about-us/the-vessels|work=Details of the lifeboats service as a lifeboat and photographs of ON 1158|publisher = Aegir Nautical\u00a9 2014|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref>  times and she rescued 458 people. 72 of these were classed as medical emergency but she is credited with saving the lives of 39 people. After the withdrawal of ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' in April 2010, the station was served by various relief fleet Tynes until the new {{Lbc|Tamar}} entered service in December.\n\n=== New ''Tamar''-class lifeboat station ===\nIn 2008 the Trustees and the RNLI set out to develop the station. A \u00a31 million public appeal was launched to help towards the cost of the re-build to accommodate a new {{Lbc|Tamar}} lifeboat. In January 2009 the work began with the demolition of the old station boathouse and slipway. Whilst the work was carried out the station was housed in temporary accommodation on Kingston Beach, with the inshore lifeboat being launched using a tractor. The Tyne-class lifeboat Lady Hermione Colwyn being moored afloat by the locks. Contracted to build the new boathouse and slipways was Dean & Dyball Civil Engineering of [[Ringwood]].<ref name=CONEWS>{{cite web|title=Construction News \u2013 New Lifeboat Station|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/buildings/project-reports/lifeboat-station-construction-101-10-06-2009/|work=Details about the Construction of the station|publisher=Copyright \u00a9 2002-2014 EMAP Publishing Limited|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The building is a timber-framed building on three storeys. Within this structure are boat halls for the all-weather lifeboat and the inshore lifeboat, each with dedicated slipways to the harbour. The new facility has office and mess accommodation, training facilities, kitchen and showers. A 10,000-litre fuel tank sitting on the middle floor enables the crew to refuel the boat inside the station.\n\n====Wave pit ====\nThe previous boathouse and station encountered problems with the occasional higher than normal spring tides.<ref name=CONEWS/> On more than one occasion the energy of south easterly storm waves would race across through the open harbour mouth and crash against the slipway, flooding the old station. A design innovation of the new station includes a wave pit at the front of the station. The steep gradient of the slipway would accentuate the waves hitting it, and the wave pit ensures that the waves break before they hit the boathouse door. The resulting seawater will drain away back into the harbour through a channel running parallel to the slipway.<ref name=CONEWS/>\n\n==== The opening ceremony ====\nThe project cost a total of \u00a34,200,000 and was officially opened by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent KG]] on Thursday 16 June 2011.

This lifeboat was funded by the generous bequests of Miss Enid Marjory Collett together with other gifts and legacies. The ''Enid Collett'' was the first Tamar-class lifeboat to go on service at a lifeboat station in the RNLI's south east region.

Customs was observing the first RNLI Shoreham lifeboat {{RNLB|Ramonet}} whilst it was out on an exercise in very rough weather and very heavy seas. The lifeboat was capsized and one of the crew members drowned. William Sheader, unaware that the crewman was already dead, at great risk to himself swam out through the breaking surf and brought his body ashore. For his bravery he was awarded an RNLI silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won. Author: Cox, Barry. Publisher:Spink & son Ltd and the RNLI, 1998.

On 1 June 1940 the lifeboat was towed to Dunkirk by Naval Drifter ''Kindred Star''. During the evacuation the lifeboat made three trips from the beaches back to Dover, but naval crews did not keep detailed logs which are the rule in the RNLI. There is a story that the naval officer in charge protected his men from shrapnel and strafing by constructing a makeshift wheelhouse from steel plate, but this has never been substantiated.\n\n==== HM Minesweeper ''President Briand'' ====\nOn 16 November 1941<ref name=LIFEGAL1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

The coxswain of the ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' then returned to the minesweeper aboard the Shoreham Pilot Cutter with the intention of piloting the minesweeper. At 9.45pm<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> the lifeboat now under command of second coxswain James Upperton,<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> was recalled up to service as both the Tug and the minesweeper were now being driven ashore in the appalling weather. At the scene the tug was trying to haul the vessel clear of shallow water but the line broke which caused the minesweeper to roll heavily and the sea began to break over her decks. With great skill and courage, avoiding the presence of the [[naval mine]]s in the vicinity, the lifeboat went alongside six or seven times and removed all 22 men aboard the minesweeper, including their own coxswain. For their part played in this rescue Second Coxswain James Upperton was awarded the RNLI silver medal and Mechanic Henry Philcox was awarded a bronze medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL1/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Gull'' ====\nFrom early morning on 8 August 1948<ref name=LIFEGAL2>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

Just of the coast at Shoreham the yacht ''Gull'' had got into difficulties and was being driven along the coast with her sails torn and shredded and she was out of control. The Shoreham Lifeboat ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' was launched to service with coxswain Upperton<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> at the helm. The lifeboat raced after the yacht and to boost her speed hoisted her sail to help her engines. The lifeboat eventually caught the yacht at the entrance to [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]] Harbour. The yacht by this time in a desperate attempt to enter the harbour, [[Jibe (sailing)|gybed]] and became waterlogged and caught in broken shallow water. The lifeboat at great risk got alongside her on two occasions and took off three men, two women and a boy. They were all landed safely at Newhaven. The lifeboat returned to Shoreham arriving back at their station at 3:30 pm after being out at sea for 7 hours.<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> For this service coxswain James Upperton received an RNLI silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL2/>\n\n=== RNLB ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' (ON 967) ===\n==== Drilling Rig ''William Allpress'' ====\nOn 19 October 1971,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

Work:FOX, John Alfred, Shoreham Lifeboat: Page 343. {{ISBN|0907605893}}</ref> the drilling rig ''[[William Press Group|William Allpress]]'' was anchored three-quarters of a mile off the coast near [[Rustington]]. The weather was slowly deteriorating and the rig was awaiting a tow into [[Portsmouth]] Harbour. After three days the conditions had caused the crew to have no food or sleep and the five men aboard were all suffering from sea sickness and it was necessary for the men to be taken off the rig. The Watson-class lifeboat {{RNLB|Dorothy and Philip Constant|ON 697}}<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> was launched at 2.10 pm in south-westerly gale to a very heavy sea, torrential rain and poor visibility. Coxswain John Fox,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> after circling the rig to assess the situation, piled all his [[Fender (boating)|fenders]] into one large one, brought the life-boat starboard on to the rig enabling the five survivors to be pulled on board across the foredeck. The lifeboat then headed back to Shoreham. The rescue had taken three hours. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Albin Ballard'' ====\nOn 5 August 1975,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

She had broached to windward and under bare poles (No sail) was drifting with the remains of her sails flapping in the water. At 3.15 am the lifeboat ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' was launched to service with coxswain John Fox<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/> at the helm. The lifeboat found the yacht due south of [[Littlehampton]] and by this time the vessel was being deluged with large breaking waves. Her crew by this time were seasick  and exhausted. Coxswain Fox put the lifeboat against the amidships of the yacht at which point two of the lifeboat men scrambled aboard. They then set up, and proceeded to take the yacht into tow. Despite losing the line once they finally towed the yacht into Shoreham arriving at 7.25 am in the morning. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/>\n\n==== MS ''Athina B'' ====\n[[File:Athina B.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The Athina B aground to the east of the Palace Pier in Brighton]]\nThe [[MS Athina B|MS ''Athina B'']] had left the [[Azores]] on 11 December 1979 laden with 3,000 tonnes of [[pumice]]. Her destination was the port at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]]. During the voyage, she had problems with her [[Electrical generator|generator]], [[gyro compass]] and [[radar]], and put in at [[La Rochelle]] in France for repairs. On arrival at Shoreham on 20 January 1980<ref name=PERIL/> the vessel was caught in a force seven or eight gale and with seas breaking across her decks, she was unable to enter Shoreham harbour. Her engines failed, and a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] call was issued. The ''Dorothy and Philip Constance'' was launched to service at 8.40 am with coxswain Ken Voice<ref name=LIFEGALVO>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won. Author: Cox, Barry.

In 1870 the Harbour Board funded the installation of a slipway.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== The RNLI station ===\nIn 1865<ref name=PERIL/> the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] took over the lifeboat cover for Shoreham Harbour. They established a station with a boathouse constructed on Kingston beach. This boathouse was used until 1892<ref name=PERIL/> when a new timber framed boathouse was built near the coastguard station on Shoreham beach on the western side of the Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> The old station building at Kingston beach was demolished.\n\nIn 1903 the boathouse was moved further from the shore and was in use until 1924.<ref name=PERIL/> In October of that year the station had to be closed due to the silting up of the harbour entrance, which had made operations hazardous and then impossible. The station did not re-open until October 1929 after work had been carried out to remove the sandbar across the harbour entrance.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== New Boathouse ===\nIn 1933 the station moved into new facilities at Kingston Beach opposite Shoreham Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> This boathouse and slipway was specifically built to accommodate a new lifeboat, the 41&nbsp;ft {{Lbc|Watson}} {{RNLB|Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn|ON 758}}.<ref name=DLS>{{cite web|title=RNLB Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn now Dowager|url= http://www.adls.org.uk/t1/content/rosa-woodd-and-phyllis-lunn-now-dowager-0|publisher=All content copyright 2009 - 2014 Association of Dunkirk Little Ships|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> This lifeboat was at Shoreham for 30 years and during that period the lifeboat was launched 244 times and saved 143 lives. Over the years since that boathouse was constructed it has undergone alterations on several occasions to accommodate different lifeboats sent to serve at the station. Problems with sinkage of the slipway led to the decision to allocate a 13-ton {{Lbc|Rother}} lifeboat (primarily designed for carriage launching) to the station in 1981. However, the slipway was strengthened following the decision to place a {{Lbc|Tyne}} boat on station and the Rother was replaced in 1986 by the first of two {{Lbc|47ft Watson}} boats that served for four years before being replaced by the new Tyne. In 1967 the station was supplied with a second lifeboat. This was a {{Lbc|D|EA16}} inshore lifeboat and was kept in its own berth constructed beneath the main boathouse.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n===''Tyne''-class lifeboat ===\nIn 1990 the station was supplied with a new {{Lbc|Tyne}} lifeboat. She was the {{RNLB|Hermione Lady Colwyn|ON 1158}}.<ref name=NAVNUTYNE>{{cite web|title=Tyne-class 47 foot Lifeboat|url=http://www.lifeboatsonline.com/RNLITyne.html|work=List of Tyne-class lifeboats, includes ON-1158|publisher =Lifeboat World On-Line\u00a9 2014|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' was on station from 1990 until 2010 and during that period she was launched to service 414<ref name=ON1158>{{cite web|title= The vessel - Odin Nautical \u2013 Tyne Class Lifeboat|url=http://www.aegirnautical.com/about-us/the-vessels|work=Details of the lifeboats service as a lifeboat and photographs of ON 1158|publisher = Aegir Nautical\u00a9 2014|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref>  times and she rescued 458 people. 72 of these were classed as medical emergency but she is credited with saving the lives of 39 people. After the withdrawal of ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' in April 2010, the station was served by various relief fleet Tynes until the new {{Lbc|Tamar}} entered service in December.\n\n=== New ''Tamar''-class lifeboat station ===\nIn 2008 the Trustees and the RNLI set out to develop the station. A \u00a31 million public appeal was launched to help towards the cost of the re-build to accommodate a new {{Lbc|Tamar}} lifeboat. In January 2009 the work began with the demolition of the old station boathouse and slipway. Whilst the work was carried out the station was housed in temporary accommodation on Kingston Beach, with the inshore lifeboat being launched using a tractor. The Tyne-class lifeboat Lady Hermione Colwyn being moored afloat by the locks. Contracted to build the new boathouse and slipways was Dean & Dyball Civil Engineering of [[Ringwood]].<ref name=CONEWS>{{cite web|title=Construction News \u2013 New Lifeboat Station|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/buildings/project-reports/lifeboat-station-construction-101-10-06-2009/|work=Details about the Construction of the station|publisher=Copyright \u00a9 2002-2014 EMAP Publishing Limited|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The building is a timber-framed building on three storeys. Within this structure are boat halls for the all-weather lifeboat and the inshore lifeboat, each with dedicated slipways to the harbour. The new facility has office and mess accommodation, training facilities, kitchen and showers. A 10,000-litre fuel tank sitting on the middle floor enables the crew to refuel the boat inside the station.\n\n====Wave pit ====\nThe previous boathouse and station encountered problems with the occasional higher than normal spring tides.<ref name=CONEWS/> On more than one occasion the energy of south easterly storm waves would race across through the open harbour mouth and crash against the slipway, flooding the old station. A design innovation of the new station includes a wave pit at the front of the station. The steep gradient of the slipway would accentuate the waves hitting it, and the wave pit ensures that the waves break before they hit the boathouse door. The resulting seawater will drain away back into the harbour through a channel running parallel to the slipway.<ref name=CONEWS/>\n\n==== The opening ceremony ====\nThe project cost a total of \u00a34,200,000 and was officially opened by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent KG]] on Thursday 16 June 2011.

This lifeboat was funded by the generous bequests of Miss Enid Marjory Collett together with other gifts and legacies. The ''Enid Collett'' was the first Tamar-class lifeboat to go on service at a lifeboat station in the RNLI's south east region.

Customs was observing the first RNLI Shoreham lifeboat {{RNLB|Ramonet}} whilst it was out on an exercise in very rough weather and very heavy seas. The lifeboat was capsized and one of the crew members drowned. William Sheader, unaware that the crewman was already dead, at great risk to himself swam out through the breaking surf and brought his body ashore. For his bravery he was awarded an RNLI silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won. Author: Cox, Barry. Publisher:Spink & son Ltd and the RNLI, 1998.

On 1 June 1940 the lifeboat was towed to Dunkirk by Naval Drifter ''Kindred Star''. During the evacuation the lifeboat made three trips from the beaches back to Dover, but naval crews did not keep detailed logs which are the rule in the RNLI. There is a story that the naval officer in charge protected his men from shrapnel and strafing by constructing a makeshift wheelhouse from steel plate, but this has never been substantiated.\n\n==== HM Minesweeper ''President Briand'' ====\nOn 16 November 1941<ref name=LIFEGAL1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

The coxswain of the ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' then returned to the minesweeper aboard the Shoreham Pilot Cutter with the intention of piloting the minesweeper. At 9.45pm<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> the lifeboat now under command of second coxswain James Upperton,<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> was recalled up to service as both the Tug and the minesweeper were now being driven ashore in the appalling weather. At the scene the tug was trying to haul the vessel clear of shallow water but the line broke which caused the minesweeper to roll heavily and the sea began to break over her decks. With great skill and courage, avoiding the presence of the [[naval mine]]s in the vicinity, the lifeboat went alongside six or seven times and removed all 22 men aboard the minesweeper, including their own coxswain. For their part played in this rescue Second Coxswain James Upperton was awarded the RNLI silver medal and Mechanic Henry Philcox was awarded a bronze medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL1/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Gull'' ====\nFrom early morning on 8 August 1948<ref name=LIFEGAL2>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

Just of the coast at Shoreham the yacht ''Gull'' had got into difficulties and was being driven along the coast with her sails torn and shredded and she was out of control. The Shoreham Lifeboat ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' was launched to service with coxswain Upperton<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> at the helm. The lifeboat raced after the yacht and to boost her speed hoisted her sail to help her engines. The lifeboat eventually caught the yacht at the entrance to [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]] Harbour. The yacht by this time in a desperate attempt to enter the harbour, [[Jibe (sailing)|gybed]] and became waterlogged and caught in broken shallow water. The lifeboat at great risk got alongside her on two occasions and took off three men, two women and a boy. They were all landed safely at Newhaven. The lifeboat returned to Shoreham arriving back at their station at 3:30 pm after being out at sea for 7 hours.<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> For this service coxswain James Upperton received an RNLI silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL2/>\n\n=== RNLB ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' (ON 967) ===\n==== Drilling Rig ''William Allpress'' ====\nOn 19 October 1971,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

The weather was slowly deteriorating and the rig was awaiting a tow into [[Portsmouth]] Harbour. After three days the conditions had caused the crew to have no food or sleep and the five men aboard were all suffering from sea sickness and it was necessary for the men to be taken off the rig. The Watson-class lifeboat {{RNLB|Dorothy and Philip Constant|ON 697}}<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> was launched at 2.10 pm in south-westerly gale to a very heavy sea, torrential rain and poor visibility. Coxswain John Fox,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> after circling the rig to assess the situation, piled all his [[Fender (boating)|fenders]] into one large one, brought the life-boat starboard on to the rig enabling the five survivors to be pulled on board across the foredeck. The lifeboat then headed back to Shoreham. The rescue had taken three hours. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Albin Ballard'' ====\nOn 5 August 1975,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

She had broached to windward and under bare poles (No sail) was drifting with the remains of her sails flapping in the water. At 3.15 am the lifeboat ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' was launched to service with coxswain John Fox<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/> at the helm. The lifeboat found the yacht due south of [[Littlehampton]] and by this time the vessel was being deluged with large breaking waves. Her crew by this time were seasick  and exhausted. Coxswain Fox put the lifeboat against the amidships of the yacht at which point two of the lifeboat men scrambled aboard. They then set up, and proceeded to take the yacht into tow. Despite losing the line once they finally towed the yacht into Shoreham arriving at 7.25 am in the morning. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/>\n\n==== MS ''Athina B'' ====\n[[File:Athina B.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The Athina B aground to the east of the Palace Pier in Brighton]]\nThe [[MS Athina B|MS ''Athina B'']] had left the [[Azores]] on 11 December 1979 laden with 3,000 tonnes of [[pumice]]. Her destination was the port at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]]. During the voyage, she had problems with her [[Electrical generator|generator]], [[gyro compass]] and [[radar]], and put in at [[La Rochelle]] in France for repairs. On arrival at Shoreham on 20 January 1980<ref name=PERIL/> the vessel was caught in a force seven or eight gale and with seas breaking across her decks, she was unable to enter Shoreham harbour. Her engines failed, and a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] call was issued.
