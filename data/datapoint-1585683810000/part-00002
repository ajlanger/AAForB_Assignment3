Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis (LAH) occurs when the [[anterior pituitary]] cells are affected by [[autoimmune]] [[inflammation]] resulting in either no symptoms, [[adrenal insufficiency]] (if the [[ACTH]] producing cells are affected), [[hypothyroidism]] (if the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] producing cells are damaged), or [[hypogonadism]] (if the [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and/or [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] producing cells are involved). In some cases, the presence of inflammation within the pituitary gland leads to interruption of [[dopamine]] flow from the [[hypothalamus]] into the pituitary causing high levels of the hormone [[prolactin]] and, often as a consequence, milk production from the breasts (in older girls and women).  Lymphocytic Infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LINH) occurs when the [[posterior pituitary]] is affected resulting in [[diabetes insipidus]]. Both LAH and LINH may also lead to symptoms of an intracranial mass such as headache or disturbance of vision, i.e. [[bitemporal hemianopia]]. The [[pituitary]] produces multiple [[hormones]] relating to various [[Metabolism|metabolic functions]]. Sufficiently low production of certain [[pituitary hormones]] can be fatal resulting in the failure of the [[thyroid]] or [[adrenal glands]].\n\nIt is estimated that, typically, it takes from 12 to 40 years for autoimmune destruction to present symptoms.<ref name=\"pmid9691980\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Str\u00f6mberg S, Crock P, Lernmark A, Hulting AL |title=Pituitary autoantibodies in patients with hypopituitarism and their relatives|journal=J.
