A stage, film and television star, she was known during her 60-year career as a consummate and versatile professional for her strong, realistic screen presence. A favorite of directors including [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Frank Capra]], she made 85 films in 38 years before turning to television.\n\nStanwyck got her start on the stage in the chorus as a [[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld]] girl in 1923 at age 16 and within a few years was acting in plays. She was then cast in her first lead role in ''Burlesque'' (1927), becoming a Broadway star. Soon after that, Stanwyck obtained film roles and got her major break when Frank Capra chose her for his romantic drama ''[[Ladies of Leisure]]'' (1930), which led to additional lead roles.\n\nIn 1937 she had the title role in ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' and received her first Academy Award nomination for best actress. In 1941 she starred in two successful screwball comedies: ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' with Gary Cooper, and ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]]. She received her second Academy Award nomination for ''Ball of Fire'', and in recent decades ''The Lady Eve'' has come to be regarded as a romantic comedy classic with Stanwyck's performance called one of the best in American comedy.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nBy 1944, Stanwyck had become the highest-paid woman in the United States. She starred alongside [[Fred MacMurray]] in the seminal film noir ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), playing the smoldering wife who persuades MacMurray's insurance salesman to kill her husband. Described as one of the ultimate portrayals of villainy, it is widely thought that Stanwyck should have won the Academy Award for Best Actress rather than being just nominated. She received another Oscar nomination for her lead performance as an invalid wife overhearing her own murder plot in the thriller film noir, ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948). After she moved into television in the 1960s, she won three [[Emmy Awards]] \u2013 for ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'' (1961), the western series ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1966), and miniseries ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'' (1983).\n\nShe received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]] in 1982, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1986 and was the recipient of several other honorary lifetime awards. She was ranked as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|11th greatest female star]] of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|accessdate=October 23, 2006|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020084914/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|archivedate=October 20, 2006}} ''[[American Film Institute]]''; retrieved November 17, 2011.</ref> An orphan at the age of four, and partially raised in foster homes, she always worked; one of her directors, [[Jacques Tourneur]], said of Stanwyck, \"She only lives for two things, and both of them are work.\"<ref>Basinger, Jeanine, ''The Star Machine'', Knopf, 2007, p. 371</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBarbara Stanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in [[Brooklyn, New York]], of English and Scottish descent.<ref name=\"Madsen8\">Madsen 1994, p. 8.</ref> She was the fifth{{snd}}and youngest{{snd}}child of Catherine Ann (n\u00e9e McPhee) (1870-1911) and Byron E.

A stage, film and television star, she was known during her 60-year career as a consummate and versatile professional for her strong, realistic screen presence. A favorite of directors including [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Frank Capra]], she made 85 films in 38 years before turning to television.\n\nStanwyck got her start on the stage in the chorus as a [[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld]] girl in 1923 at age 16 and within a few years was acting in plays. She was then cast in her first lead role in ''Burlesque'' (1927), becoming a Broadway star. Soon after that, Stanwyck obtained film roles and got her major break when Frank Capra chose her for his romantic drama ''[[Ladies of Leisure]]'' (1930), which led to additional lead roles.\n\nIn 1937 she had the title role in ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' and received her first Academy Award nomination for best actress. In 1941 she starred in two successful screwball comedies: ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' with Gary Cooper, and ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]]. She received her second Academy Award nomination for ''Ball of Fire'', and in recent decades ''The Lady Eve'' has come to be regarded as a romantic comedy classic with Stanwyck's performance called one of the best in American comedy.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nBy 1944, Stanwyck had become the highest-paid woman in the United States. She starred alongside [[Fred MacMurray]] in the seminal film noir ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), playing the smoldering wife who persuades MacMurray's insurance salesman to kill her husband. Described as one of the ultimate portrayals of villainy, it is widely thought that Stanwyck should have won the Academy Award for Best Actress rather than being just nominated. She received another Oscar nomination for her lead performance as an invalid wife overhearing her own murder plot in the thriller film noir, ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948). After she moved into television in the 1960s, she won three [[Emmy Awards]] \u2013 for ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'' (1961), the western series ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1966), and miniseries ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'' (1983).\n\nShe received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]] in 1982, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B.
