The applications were due into the [[U.S. Department of Education]] by Feb. 8, 2010. These funds were made available to states by formula and competed for by school districts. As they competed for the funds, school districts/local educational agencies (LEAs) were required to identify the schools they wanted to transform, and then determine which of four models was most appropriate: the turnaround model, the restart model, school closure, or the transformation model. The law delineates the requirements for each of the four models. If a school had begun implementation of one of these four models or components of one of these models within the previous two years, it was permitted to apply to use SIG funds to continue to implement the full model.\n\n==Lowest Achieving==\n\nThe SIG program reflects the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government's]] prioritization of the lowest-achieving [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The [http://www.centerii.org/ Center on Innovation & Improvement], one of five federally funded content centers, has developed extensive guidance regarding implementation of the SIG program.<ref>Perlman, C. L., & Redding, S. (Eds.) (2009). ''Handbook on Effective Implementation of School Improvement Grants''. Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement.

Under guidance promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, states must distribute 95% of their SIG grant dollars to districts and, in turn, districts must prioritize awards to districts based on need as measured by individual schools\u2019 academic performance and concentration of [[poverty]]. As outlined in the law, when awarding subgrants to districts, states must \u201cgive priority to the local educational agencies with the lowest-achieving schools that demonstrate \u2014\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the greatest need for such funds; and\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the strongest commitment to ensuring that such funds are used to provide adequate resources to enable the lowest-achieving schools to meet the goals under school and local educational improvement, corrective action, and restructuring plans under section 1116.\u201d\n\nUnder the 2010 guidance related to Section 1003(g), state departments of education are required to identify their \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving\u201d schools . School districts that have schools identified as persistently lowest-achieving apply to the [[state department of education]] to obtain School Improvement Grants. As part of their grant application, districts must identify which of the four intervention models (i.e., turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation) they intend to implement in each of the identified lowest-achieving schools. While the LEAs must apply one of the four intervention models in schools defined as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving,\u201d once the state has allocated adequate resources to these schools, according to the federal requirements, the state can use the remaining School Improvement Grant funds for districts to implement other interventions and supports to improve other Title I schools (i.e., schools eligible for [[federal aid]] under Title I of ESEA [i.e., NCLB] due to high concentrations of poverty) in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring.\n\n==Tiers==\nThe SIG regulations define three tiers of schools for purposes of obtaining SIG funds.<ref>U.S. Department of Education. (2009). ''School Improvement Grants--American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965: Notice of proposed requirements''. Washington, DC: Author. Retrieved from: http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2009-3/082609d.html\n</ref> Each tier represents a level of priority for the SIG funds. In determining which districts receive grants, the state takes into account (1) the number of low-performing schools in the state, (2) the tiers these schools occupy, and (3) the LEA\u2019s capacity to effectively implement the models and strategies outlined in the SIG application. The three tiers of schools identified as lowest achieving, in priority order for assistance through School Improvement Grants, are:\n* Tier I: Title I schools in improvement, [[corrective action]], or restructuring that are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier II: Secondary schools that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I-Part A funds and are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier III: Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are not Tier I schools.\n\n==School Improvement Grant intervention models==\n\n===Turnaround model===\n\nChanges required to occur under the turnaround model as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education are:\n* Replace principal\n* Use locally adopted \"turnaround\" competencies to review and select staff for school (rehire no more than 50% of existing staff)\n* Implement strategies to recruit, place, and retain staff\n* Select and implement an instructional model based on student needs\n* Provide job-embedded [[professional development]] (PD) designed to build capacity and support staff\n* Ensure continuous use of data to inform and differentiate instruction\n* Provide increased learning time for staff and students\n* Provide social-emotional and community-oriented services and supports\n* Implement new [[governance]] structure\n* Grant operating flexibility to school leader\n\nSchools implementing the turnaround model may also implement any of the required or permissible strategies under the Transformation Model.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the turnaround model is that the existing configuration of [[leadership]] and instructional personnel has not created a learning environment in which students are succeeding. Therefore, in order to dramatically change the environment for the benefit of the children currently enrolled in the school, the adults must change.<ref>Center on Innovation & Improvement (Writer, Producer), & Council of Chief State School Officers (Producer).

Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement. Retrieved from http://www.centerii.org/</ref> Under the turnaround model, change entails literal change of personnel as well as behavioral change by the high-capacity personnel that remain.\n\n===Restart model===\n\nUnder the restart model, the district converts a school or closes and reopens a school under a charter school operator, a charter management organization (CMO), or an education management organization (EMO) that has been selected through a rigorous review process.<ref>For additional information about charter management organizations, see: National Resource Center on Charter School Finance and Governance: http://www.charterresource.org/</ref> A restart model must enroll, within the grades it serves, any former student who wishes to attend the school. A rigorous review process could take into consideration such things as an applicant\u2019s team, track record, instructional program, model\u2019s theory of action, and [[sustainability]]. As part of this model, a state must review the process the LEA will use/has used to select the partner.\n\nThe theory of action underlying restart, also referred to as \"Starting Fresh\" as first codified in the charter sector,<ref>Hassel, B.

National Association of Charter School Authorizers. http://www.qualitycharters.org/i4a/pages/Index.cfm?pageID=3381</ref> is that restart allows a state, district, or other authorizing entity to break the cycle of low achievement by making deep and fundamental changes to the way the school operates.

Other schools should be within reasonable proximity to the closed school and may include, but are not limited to, charter schools or new schools for which achievement data are not yet available.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the closure model is that school capacity according to multiple measures (e.g., academic performance, school culture/expectations, teacher performance, or facilities) is so low as to preclude a reasonable expectation of dramatic improvement for students currently enrolled.<ref>\u2022\tSteiner, L.

For example, in a September 25, 2009 open letter to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Gail Connelly, Executive Director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), wrote, \u201cNAESP supports the Secretary\u2019s initiative to identify the lowest performing schools, establish rigorous interventions, provide them sufficient resources over multiple years to implement those interventions, and hold them accountable for improving student performance. However, we fundamentally disagree with the approach to enact this wide-ranging and transformational reform initiative with the simplistic and reactionary step of replacing principals as the first step in turning around low-performing schools. NAESP strongly supports reform models that provide the essential resources existing principals of low-performing schools must have to succeed. These resources include the necessary time, talent and tools.\u201d\n\nAnd on March 1, 2010, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] gave a speech speaking of the necessity of letting go teachers at failing schools such as those in the Central Falls (RI) School District's only high school, [[Dennis Van Roekel]], president of the [[National Education Association]], said, \u201cThe tone used to describe the teachers in Central Falls has been disparaging and unforgiving. It's time for federal officials to get out of the blame game and into the classroom. One thing is certain: Firing the entire faculty of a school that is on the path to improvement is no recipe for turning around a struggling high school. And relying on a magical pool of \u2018excellent teachers\u2019 to spring forth and replace them is na\u00efve at best and desperately misguided. Approaches that point the finger at educators do nothing to bring about substantive improvements for students. To the contrary, it provides a momentary perception of correcting a problem. But in reality, we all know that the solution is not blame, it is collaboration\u2014collaboration among school employees, management, parents and communities.  No one benefits when school staffs are summarily dismissed \u2014- not communities and certainly not students.  In the end all that approach gets anyone is a good sound bite.\u201d\n\nA critical review of School Improvement Grants was published by Craig Waddell, in April 2011.<ref>Waddell, Craig (2011). \"School Improvement Grants: Ransoming Title I Schools in Distress\".  [[Current Issues in Education]] 14(1).  Available at: http://cie.asu.edu/ojs/index.php/cieatasu/article/view/590/142.</ref>\n\nA study published by the Department of Education in January 2017, days before the end of the Obama administration, found \"no significant impact on math or reading test scores, high school graduation, or college enrollment\" by the School Improvement Grants program.<ref>Institute of Education Sciences (2017). \"School Improvement Grants: Implementation and Effectiveness\". U.S. Department of Education. Available at: https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20174013/pdf/20174013.pdf</ref> The findings of the report will likely be used to support a push by the incoming Secretary of Education away from such programs designed around intervening in low-performing schools, in favor of implementing \"[[school choice]]\" policies instead. The Trump administration's nominee, [[Betsy DeVos]], has been a proponent of privatization of education and creation of charter schools, instead of attempting to improve currently failing public schools.\n\n== Cited References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Additional resources and references ==\n\nCenter on Innovation & Improvement.

The final requirements for the SIG program, set forth in 74 FR 65618 (Dec. 10, 2009), and amended by the interim final requirements, set forth in 75 FR (Jan. 21, 2010) (final requirements), implement both the requirements of section 1003(g) of the ESEA and the flexibilities for the SIG program provided through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010</ref> the Department has articulated very specific parameters regarding the approaches states and districts are to use to drive dramatic improvement. Under guidance promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, states must distribute 95% of their SIG grant dollars to districts and, in turn, districts must prioritize awards to districts based on need as measured by individual schools\u2019 academic performance and concentration of [[poverty]]. As outlined in the law, when awarding subgrants to districts, states must \u201cgive priority to the local educational agencies with the lowest-achieving schools that demonstrate \u2014\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the greatest need for such funds; and\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the strongest commitment to ensuring that such funds are used to provide adequate resources to enable the lowest-achieving schools to meet the goals under school and local educational improvement, corrective action, and restructuring plans under section 1116.\u201d\n\nUnder the 2010 guidance related to Section 1003(g), state departments of education are required to identify their \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving\u201d schools . School districts that have schools identified as persistently lowest-achieving apply to the [[state department of education]] to obtain School Improvement Grants. As part of their grant application, districts must identify which of the four intervention models (i.e., turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation) they intend to implement in each of the identified lowest-achieving schools. While the LEAs must apply one of the four intervention models in schools defined as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving,\u201d once the state has allocated adequate resources to these schools, according to the federal requirements, the state can use the remaining School Improvement Grant funds for districts to implement other interventions and supports to improve other Title I schools (i.e., schools eligible for [[federal aid]] under Title I of ESEA [i.e., NCLB] due to high concentrations of poverty) in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring.\n\n==Tiers==\nThe SIG regulations define three tiers of schools for purposes of obtaining SIG funds.<ref>U.S. Department of Education. (2009). ''School Improvement Grants--American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965: Notice of proposed requirements''. Washington, DC: Author. Retrieved from: http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2009-3/082609d.html\n</ref> Each tier represents a level of priority for the SIG funds. In determining which districts receive grants, the state takes into account (1) the number of low-performing schools in the state, (2) the tiers these schools occupy, and (3) the LEA\u2019s capacity to effectively implement the models and strategies outlined in the SIG application. The three tiers of schools identified as lowest achieving, in priority order for assistance through School Improvement Grants, are:\n* Tier I: Title I schools in improvement, [[corrective action]], or restructuring that are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier II: Secondary schools that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I-Part A funds and are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier III: Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are not Tier I schools.\n\n==School Improvement Grant intervention models==\n\n===Turnaround model===\n\nChanges required to occur under the turnaround model as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education are:\n* Replace principal\n* Use locally adopted \"turnaround\" competencies to review and select staff for school (rehire no more than 50% of existing staff)\n* Implement strategies to recruit, place, and retain staff\n* Select and implement an instructional model based on student needs\n* Provide job-embedded [[professional development]] (PD) designed to build capacity and support staff\n* Ensure continuous use of data to inform and differentiate instruction\n* Provide increased learning time for staff and students\n* Provide social-emotional and community-oriented services and supports\n* Implement new [[governance]] structure\n* Grant operating flexibility to school leader\n\nSchools implementing the turnaround model may also implement any of the required or permissible strategies under the Transformation Model.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the turnaround model is that the existing configuration of [[leadership]] and instructional personnel has not created a learning environment in which students are succeeding. Therefore, in order to dramatically change the environment for the benefit of the children currently enrolled in the school, the adults must change.<ref>Center on Innovation & Improvement (Writer, Producer), & Council of Chief State School Officers (Producer).

Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement. Retrieved from http://www.centerii.org/</ref> Under the turnaround model, change entails literal change of personnel as well as behavioral change by the high-capacity personnel that remain.\n\n===Restart model===\n\nUnder the restart model, the district converts a school or closes and reopens a school under a charter school operator, a charter management organization (CMO), or an education management organization (EMO) that has been selected through a rigorous review process.<ref>For additional information about charter management organizations, see: National Resource Center on Charter School Finance and Governance: http://www.charterresource.org/</ref> A restart model must enroll, within the grades it serves, any former student who wishes to attend the school. A rigorous review process could take into consideration such things as an applicant\u2019s team, track record, instructional program, model\u2019s theory of action, and [[sustainability]]. As part of this model, a state must review the process the LEA will use/has used to select the partner.\n\nThe theory of action underlying restart, also referred to as \"Starting Fresh\" as first codified in the charter sector,<ref>Hassel, B. C. & Hassel, E. A. (2005). Starting Fresh in Low-Performing Schools: A New Option for School District Leaders under NCLB. National Association of Charter School Authorizers. http://www.qualitycharters.org/i4a/pages/Index.cfm?pageID=3381</ref> is that restart allows a state, district, or other authorizing entity to break the cycle of low achievement by making deep and fundamental changes to the way the school operates.

Other schools should be within reasonable proximity to the closed school and may include, but are not limited to, charter schools or new schools for which achievement data are not yet available.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the closure model is that school capacity according to multiple measures (e.g., academic performance, school culture/expectations, teacher performance, or facilities) is so low as to preclude a reasonable expectation of dramatic improvement for students currently enrolled.<ref>\u2022\tSteiner, L.

Rather, success is generally a result of multiple coordinated initiatives.\nHowever, there is strong evidence that a key aspect of successful restructuring under NCLB is use data (e.g., at least once a month) to make decisions about instructional practices.

For example, in a September 25, 2009 open letter to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Gail Connelly, Executive Director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), wrote, \u201cNAESP supports the Secretary\u2019s initiative to identify the lowest performing schools, establish rigorous interventions, provide them sufficient resources over multiple years to implement those interventions, and hold them accountable for improving student performance. However, we fundamentally disagree with the approach to enact this wide-ranging and transformational reform initiative with the simplistic and reactionary step of replacing principals as the first step in turning around low-performing schools. NAESP strongly supports reform models that provide the essential resources existing principals of low-performing schools must have to succeed. These resources include the necessary time, talent and tools.\u201d\n\nAnd on March 1, 2010, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] gave a speech speaking of the necessity of letting go teachers at failing schools such as those in the Central Falls (RI) School District's only high school, [[Dennis Van Roekel]], president of the [[National Education Association]], said, \u201cThe tone used to describe the teachers in Central Falls has been disparaging and unforgiving. It's time for federal officials to get out of the blame game and into the classroom. One thing is certain: Firing the entire faculty of a school that is on the path to improvement is no recipe for turning around a struggling high school. And relying on a magical pool of \u2018excellent teachers\u2019 to spring forth and replace them is na\u00efve at best and desperately misguided. Approaches that point the finger at educators do nothing to bring about substantive improvements for students. To the contrary, it provides a momentary perception of correcting a problem. But in reality, we all know that the solution is not blame, it is collaboration\u2014collaboration among school employees, management, parents and communities.  No one benefits when school staffs are summarily dismissed \u2014- not communities and certainly not students.  In the end all that approach gets anyone is a good sound bite.\u201d\n\nA critical review of School Improvement Grants was published by Craig Waddell, in April 2011.<ref>Waddell, Craig (2011). \"School Improvement Grants: Ransoming Title I Schools in Distress\".  [[Current Issues in Education]] 14(1).  Available at: http://cie.asu.edu/ojs/index.php/cieatasu/article/view/590/142.</ref>\n\nA study published by the Department of Education in January 2017, days before the end of the Obama administration, found \"no significant impact on math or reading test scores, high school graduation, or college enrollment\" by the School Improvement Grants program.<ref>Institute of Education Sciences (2017). \"School Improvement Grants: Implementation and Effectiveness\". U.S. Department of Education. Available at: https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20174013/pdf/20174013.pdf</ref> The findings of the report will likely be used to support a push by the incoming Secretary of Education away from such programs designed around intervening in low-performing schools, in favor of implementing \"[[school choice]]\" policies instead. The Trump administration's nominee, [[Betsy DeVos]], has been a proponent of privatization of education and creation of charter schools, instead of attempting to improve currently failing public schools.\n\n== Cited References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Additional resources and references ==\n\nCenter on Innovation & Improvement.
