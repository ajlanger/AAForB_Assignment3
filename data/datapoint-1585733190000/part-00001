Funded as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], it was announced by President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of Education [[Arne Duncan]] on July 24, 2009. States competing for the grants were awarded points for enacting certain educational policies, instituting performance-based evaluations for teachers and principals based on multiple measures of educator effectiveness (tied to targeted professional development and feedback), adopting common standards (though adoption of the [[Common Core]] State Standards was not required), adopting policies that did not prohibit (or effectively prohibit) the expansion of high-quality [[charter schools]], turning around the lowest-performing schools, and building and using data systems.\n\n==Criteria for funding==\n{{Nudge Theory}}\nState applications for funding were scored on selection criteria worth a total of 500 points.

Teachers' unions argued that state tests are an inaccurate way to measure teacher effectiveness, considering the fact that learning gains on assessments is only one component of the evaluation systems. Conservatives complained that it imposes federal overreach on state schools, and others argued that charter schools weaken public education.<ref>{{cite news\n|work=[[The Guardian]]\n|title=Obama offers 'Race to the Top' contest for schools\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8625198?FORM=ZZNR7\n|accessdate=January 26, 2010\n| location=London\n| date=January 23, 2008\n}}</ref> In explaining why Texas would not be applying for Race to the Top funding, then Governor [[Rick Perry]] stated, \"we would be foolish and irresponsible to place our children's future in the hands of unelected bureaucrats and special interest groups thousands of miles away in Washington.\"<ref name=\"rickperry\">{{cite web\n|publisher=Office of Governor [[Rick Perry]]\n|title=Press Releases - Gov.

Because the performance measures included in the applications are indicators of success in improving student outcomes, the APR is one way to hold states accountable for meeting targets in improving student outcomes. An APR also includes reports and updates on laws, statutes, regulations, and/or guidelines that impact reform plans, as well as progress in meeting the \"absolute priority\" and \"competitive preference priority\", which emphasize a comprehensive focus on reform and an emphasis on STEM education. The APR includes updates on progress in meeting the invitation priorities in the approved plans (innovations for improving early learning outcomes; expansiouun and adaptation of statewide longitudinal data systems; P-20 coordination, vertical and horizontal alignment; and school-level conditions for reform, innovation, and learning).<ref name=\"performance\">{{cite web\n|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]]\n|title=Race to the Top Annual Performance Report\n|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/performance.html\n|accessdate=March 10, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nThe APR measures things like graduating rates.

In such integrated systems, students can access their assignments, grades and learning activities; parents can view the academic expectations of their child, and his or her school attendance and grades; and teachers and principals can access their students\u2019 data and find strategies and resources (e.g., sample lesson plans) to meet their instructional needs. Access to data and training that help teachers improve instruction to meet their students\u2019 needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/rttfinalrptfull.pdf|title=Fundamental Change Innovation in America\u2019s Schools Under Race to the Top|last=|first=|date=|website=ed.gov|accessdate=2017-10-22}}</ref>\n\nRace to the Top states provided extensive training opportunities for teachers to increase their data analysis skills and use student performance data to customize learning for individual students. Teachers are using new data and tools to effectively and quickly check on students\u2019 progress and understanding in the course of a single session or over a few weeks.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\nAlthough the vast majority of states have competed to win the grants, Race to the Top has also been criticized by politicians, policy analysts, thought leaders, and educators. Teachers' unions argued that state tests are an inaccurate way to measure teacher effectiveness, considering the fact that learning gains on assessments is only one component of the evaluation systems. Conservatives complained that it imposes federal overreach on state schools, and others argued that charter schools weaken public education.<ref>{{cite news\n|work=[[The Guardian]]\n|title=Obama offers 'Race to the Top' contest for schools\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8625198?FORM=ZZNR7\n|accessdate=January 26, 2010\n| location=London\n| date=January 23, 2008\n}}</ref> In explaining why Texas would not be applying for Race to the Top funding, then Governor [[Rick Perry]] stated, \"we would be foolish and irresponsible to place our children's future in the hands of unelected bureaucrats and special interest groups thousands of miles away in Washington.\"<ref name=\"rickperry\">{{cite web\n|publisher=Office of Governor [[Rick Perry]]\n|title=Press Releases - Gov.
