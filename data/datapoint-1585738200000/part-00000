Li-ion batteries use an [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalated]] lithium [[Chemical compound|compound]] as the material at the positive electrode and typically [[graphite]] at the negative electrode. \nThe batteries have a high [[energy density]], no [[memory effect]] (other than [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|LFP cells]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-memory-effect-lithium-ion-batteries.html |title=Memory effect now also found in lithium-ion batteries |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> and low [[self-discharge]]. They can however be a safety hazard since they contain a flammable electrolyte, and if damaged or incorrectly charged can lead to explosions and fires. [[Samsung]] was forced to recall [[Samsung Galaxy Note 7#Battery faults|Galaxy Note 7]] handsets following lithium-ion fires,<ref name=s7NYT/> and there have been several incidents involving batteries on [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems|Boeing 787]]s.\n\nChemistry, performance, cost and safety characteristics vary across LIB types. Handheld electronics mostly use [[Lithium polymer battery|lithium polymer batteries]] (with a polymer gel as electrolyte) with [[lithium cobalt oxide]] ({{chem|LiCoO|2}}) as cathode material, which offers high energy density, but presents safety risks,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mauger |first1=A |last2=Julien |first2=C.M. |date=28 June 2017 |title=Critical review on lithium-ion batteries: are they safe?

However, this rechargeable lithium battery could never be made practical. Titanium disulfide was a poor choice, since it has to be synthesized under completely sealed conditions, also being quite expensive (~$1,000 per kilogram for titanium disulfide raw material in 1970s). When exposed to air, titanium disulfide reacts to form hydrogen sulfide compounds, which have an unpleasant odour and are toxic to most animals.

During discharge an oxidation reaction at the anode produces positively charged lithium ions and negatively charged electrons, as well as uncharged material that remains at the anode; after transport of the lithium ions through the electrolyte and of electrons through an external circuit, they recombine at the cathode together with the cathode material in a reduction reaction. The electrolyte and external circuit provide conductive media for lithium ions and electrons, respectively, but do not partake in the electrochemical reaction. With electrons flowing towards the cathode during discharge, the electrode at that side of the cell is the positive one. The reactions during discharge lower the chemical potential of the cell, so discharging transfers [[energy]] from the cell to wherever the electric current dissipates its energy, usually in the external circuit. During charging these reactions and transports take place in the opposite direction; with electrons now moving from (still positive terminal) anode to cathode (anode and cathode change places during charge and discharge), the external circuit has to provide electric energy for charging to occur, and this energy is then (with some loss) stored as chemical energy in the cell.\n\nBoth electrodes allow lithium ions to move in and out of their structures with a process called ''insertion'' (''[[Graphite intercalation compound|intercalation]]'') or ''extraction'' (''deintercalation''), respectively. As the lithium ions \"rock\" back and forth between the two electrodes, these batteries are also known as \"rocking-chair batteries\" or \"swing batteries\" (a term given by some European industries).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Guyomard |first=Dominique |last2=Tarascon |first2=Jean-Marie |date=1994 |title=Rocking-chair or lithium-ion rechargeable lithium batteries |journal=Advanced Materials |language=en |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=408\u2013412 |doi=10.1002/adma.19940060516 |issn=1521-4095}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries |journal=Journal of Power Sources |volume=51 |issue=1\u20132 |last=Megahed |first=Sid |last2=Scrosati |first2=Bruno |pages=79\u2013104 |doi=10.1016/0378-7753(94)01956-8 |year=1994 |bibcode=1994JPS....51...79M}}</ref> During [[Battery capacity|discharge]], the (positive) lithium ions move from the negative electrode ([[anode]]) (usually graphite = \"<chem>C6</chem>\" as below) to the positive electrode ([[cathode]]) (forming a lithium compound) through the electrolyte while the electrons flow through the external circuit in the same direction.<ref name=\"HSW-MB\">{{cite web |last1=Brain |first1=Marshall |title=How Lithium-ion Batteries Work |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/lithium-ion-battery1.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=20 March 2017 |date=14 November 2006}}</ref> When the cell is [[Battery capacity|charging]], the reverse occurs with the lithium ions and electrons move back into the negative electrode in a net higher energy state.

Typically, the charge is terminated at 3% of the initial charge current. In the past, lithium-ion batteries could not be fast-charged and needed at least two hours to fully charge. Current-generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less. In 2015 researchers demonstrated a small 600 mAh capacity battery charged to 68 percent capacity in two minutes and a 3,000 mAh battery charged to 48 percent capacity in five minutes. The latter battery has an energy density of 620 W\u00b7h/L. The device employed heteroatoms bonded to graphite molecules in the anode.<ref>{{Cite web|title = New battery tech gives 10 hours of talk time after only 5 minutes on charge|url = http://www.gizmag.com/huawei-fast-charging-li-ion-batteries/40421|website = www.gizmag.com|accessdate = 3 December 2015|first = Aaron|last = Turpen|date = 16 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nPerformance of manufactured batteries has improved over time.

It is by slow electrochemical processes, the formation of a solid-electrolyte inter phase (SEI) in the negative electrode.

If proper additives are added to the electrolyte to promote SEI formation, the co-embedding of solvent molecules can be effectively prevented and the damage to electrode materials can be avoided.

This increases cell impedance and reduces capacity.<ref name=\"2014JPS...262..129W\" /> Gases formed by electrolyte decomposition can increase the cell's internal pressure and are a potential safety issue in demanding environments such as mobile devices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBelow 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, plating of metallic Lithium on the anodes and subsequent reaction with the electrolyte is leading to loss of cyclable Lithium.<ref name=\"2014JPS...262..129W\" />\n\nExtended storage can trigger an incremental increase in film thickness and capacity loss.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCharging at greater than 4.2 V can initiate Li<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;plating on the anode, producing irreversible capacity loss. The randomness of the metallic lithium embedded in the anode during intercalation results in [[dendrites]] formation. Over time the dendrites can accumulate and pierce the separator, causing a [[short circuit]] leading to heat, fire or explosion. This process is referred to as [[thermal runaway]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDischarging beyond 2 V can also result in capacity loss. The (copper) anode current collector can dissolve into the electrolyte. When charged, copper ions can reduce on the anode as metallic copper. Over time, copper dendrites can form and cause a short in the same manner as lithium.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigh cycling rates and state of charge induces mechanical strain on the anode's graphite lattice. Mechanical strain caused by intercalation and de-intercalation creates fissures and splits of the graphite particles, changing their orientation.

Phosphorus oxyfluoride in turn reacts to form additional HF and difluorohydroxy [[phosphoric acid]]. HF converts the rigid SEI film into a fragile one. On the cathode, the carbonate solvent can then diffuse onto the cathode oxide over time, releasing heat and thermal runaway.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDecomposition of electrolyte salts and interactions between the salts and solvent start at as low as 70 C. Significant decomposition occurs at higher temperatures. At 85 C [[transesterification]] products, such as dimethyl-2,5-dioxahexane carboxylate (DMDOHC)  are formed from EC reacting with DMC.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Cathode ====\nCathode degradation mechanisms include manganese dissolution, electrolyte oxidation and structural disorder.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn {{chem|LiMnO|4}} hydrofluoric acid catalyzes the loss of metallic manganese through disproportionation of trivalent manganese:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: 2Mn<sup>3+</sup> \u2192 Mn<sup>2+</sup>+ Mn<sup>4+</sup>\n\nMaterial loss of the spinel results in capacity fade.

This significantly improves battery efficiency and increases capacity. As the number of cells and load currents increase, the potential for mismatch increases. The two kinds of mismatch are state-of-charge (SOC) and capacity/energy (\"C/E\"). Though SOC is more common, each problem limits pack charge capacity (mA\u00b7h) to that of the weakest cell.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Safety==\n{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents|Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems}}\n\n=== Fire hazard ===\nLithium-ion batteries can be a safety hazard since they contain a flammable electrolyte and may become pressurized if they become damaged.

However, these additional devices occupy space inside the cells, add points of failure, and may irreversibly disable the cell when activated. Further, these features increase costs compared to [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride batteries]], which require only a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device and a back-up pressure valve.<ref name=\"WinterBrodd2004\"/> Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. Also, these features can not be applied to all kinds of cells, e.g. prismatic high current cells cannot be equipped with a vent or thermal interrupt. High current cells must not produce excessive heat or oxygen, lest there be a failure, possibly violent. Instead, they must be equipped with internal thermal fuses which act before the anode and cathode reach their thermal limits.\n\nReplacing the [[lithium cobalt oxide]] positive electrode material in lithium-ion batteries with a lithium metal phosphate such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) improves cycle counts, shelf life and safety, but lowers capacity.

Li-ion batteries use an [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalated]] lithium [[Chemical compound|compound]] as the material at the positive electrode and typically [[graphite]] at the negative electrode. \nThe batteries have a high [[energy density]], no [[memory effect]] (other than [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|LFP cells]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-memory-effect-lithium-ion-batteries.html |title=Memory effect now also found in lithium-ion batteries |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> and low [[self-discharge]].

During discharge an oxidation reaction at the anode produces positively charged lithium ions and negatively charged electrons, as well as uncharged material that remains at the anode; after transport of the lithium ions through the electrolyte and of electrons through an external circuit, they recombine at the cathode together with the cathode material in a reduction reaction. The electrolyte and external circuit provide conductive media for lithium ions and electrons, respectively, but do not partake in the electrochemical reaction. With electrons flowing towards the cathode during discharge, the electrode at that side of the cell is the positive one. The reactions during discharge lower the chemical potential of the cell, so discharging transfers [[energy]] from the cell to wherever the electric current dissipates its energy, usually in the external circuit. During charging these reactions and transports take place in the opposite direction; with electrons now moving from (still positive terminal) anode to cathode (anode and cathode change places during charge and discharge), the external circuit has to provide electric energy for charging to occur, and this energy is then (with some loss) stored as chemical energy in the cell.\n\nBoth electrodes allow lithium ions to move in and out of their structures with a process called ''insertion'' (''[[Graphite intercalation compound|intercalation]]'') or ''extraction'' (''deintercalation''), respectively. As the lithium ions \"rock\" back and forth between the two electrodes, these batteries are also known as \"rocking-chair batteries\" or \"swing batteries\" (a term given by some European industries).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Guyomard |first=Dominique |last2=Tarascon |first2=Jean-Marie |date=1994 |title=Rocking-chair or lithium-ion rechargeable lithium batteries |journal=Advanced Materials |language=en |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=408\u2013412 |doi=10.1002/adma.19940060516 |issn=1521-4095}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries |journal=Journal of Power Sources |volume=51 |issue=1\u20132 |last=Megahed |first=Sid |last2=Scrosati |first2=Bruno |pages=79\u2013104 |doi=10.1016/0378-7753(94)01956-8 |year=1994 |bibcode=1994JPS....51...79M}}</ref> During [[Battery capacity|discharge]], the (positive) lithium ions move from the negative electrode ([[anode]]) (usually graphite = \"<chem>C6</chem>\" as below) to the positive electrode ([[cathode]]) (forming a lithium compound) through the electrolyte while the electrons flow through the external circuit in the same direction.<ref name=\"HSW-MB\">{{cite web |last1=Brain |first1=Marshall |title=How Lithium-ion Batteries Work |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/lithium-ion-battery1.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=20 March 2017 |date=14 November 2006}}</ref> When the cell is [[Battery capacity|charging]], the reverse occurs with the lithium ions and electrons move back into the negative electrode in a net higher energy state.

Lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide positives with graphite negatives have a 3.7&nbsp;V nominal voltage with a 4.2&nbsp;V maximum while charging. The charging procedure is performed at constant voltage with current-limiting circuitry (i.e., charging with constant current until a voltage of 4.2&nbsp;V is reached in the cell and continuing with a constant voltage applied until the current drops close to zero). Typically, the charge is terminated at 3% of the initial charge current. In the past, lithium-ion batteries could not be fast-charged and needed at least two hours to fully charge. Current-generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less. In 2015 researchers demonstrated a small 600 mAh capacity battery charged to 68 percent capacity in two minutes and a 3,000 mAh battery charged to 48 percent capacity in five minutes.

While charging, the lithium ions must travel to the outer edges of the graphene sheet before coming to rest (intercalating) between the sheets. The circuitous route takes so long that they encounter congestion around those edges.<ref name=nwu1404>{{cite web |url=http://electroiq.com/blog/2011/11/northwestern-researchers-advance-li-ion-battery-with-graphene-silicon-sandwich/ |title=Northwestern researchers advance Li-ion batteries with graphene-silicon sandwich &#124; Solid State Technology |publisher=Electroiq.com |date=November 2011 |access-date=3 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315064945/http://electroiq.com/blog/2011/11/northwestern-researchers-advance-li-ion-battery-with-graphene-silicon-sandwich/ |archive-date=15 March 2018 |url-status=dead  }}<br/>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/aenm.201100426| title = In-Plane Vacancy-Enabled High-Power Si-Graphene Composite Electrode for Lithium-Ion Batteries| journal = Advanced Energy Materials| volume = 1| issue = 6| pages = 1079\u20131084| year = 2011| last1 = Zhao | first1 = X. | last2 = Hayner | first2 = C.

The layer is composed of electrolyte \u2013 carbonate reduction products that serve both as an ionic conductor and electronic insulator. It forms on both the anode and cathode and determines many performance parameters. Under typical conditions, such as room temperature and the absence of charge effects and contaminants, the layer reaches a fixed thickness after the first charge, allowing the device to operate for years. However, operation outside such parameters can degrade the device via several reactions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2014/04/trace-degradation-analysis-lithium-ion-battery-components|title = Trace Degradation Analysis of Lithium-Ion Battery Components|last = Voelker|first = Paul|date = 22 April 2014|work = R&D|access-date = 4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nLithium-ion batteries are prone to capacity fading over thousands of cycles. It is by slow electrochemical processes, the formation of a solid-electrolyte inter phase (SEI) in the negative electrode. SEI forms in between the first charge and discharge and results in the consumption of lithium ions. The consumption of lithium ions reduces the charge and discharge efficiency of the electrode material.<ref>Alexander K Suttman.(2011).Lithium Ion Battery Aging Experiments and Algorithm Development for Life Estimation. Published by The Ohio State University and OhioLINK</ref> However, SEI film is organic solvent insoluble and hence it can be stable in organic electrolyte solutions. If proper additives are added to the electrolyte to promote SEI formation, the co-embedding of solvent molecules can be effectively prevented and the damage to electrode materials can be avoided. On the other hand, SEI is selective and allows lithium ions to pass through and forbids electrons to pass through. This guarantees the continuity of charging and discharging cycle.<ref>Matthew B.

This increases cell impedance and reduces capacity.<ref name=\"2014JPS...262..129W\" /> Gases formed by electrolyte decomposition can increase the cell's internal pressure and are a potential safety issue in demanding environments such as mobile devices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBelow 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, plating of metallic Lithium on the anodes and subsequent reaction with the electrolyte is leading to loss of cyclable Lithium.<ref name=\"2014JPS...262..129W\" />\n\nExtended storage can trigger an incremental increase in film thickness and capacity loss.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCharging at greater than 4.2 V can initiate Li<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;plating on the anode, producing irreversible capacity loss. The randomness of the metallic lithium embedded in the anode during intercalation results in [[dendrites]] formation. Over time the dendrites can accumulate and pierce the separator, causing a [[short circuit]] leading to heat, fire or explosion. This process is referred to as [[thermal runaway]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDischarging beyond 2 V can also result in capacity loss. The (copper) anode current collector can dissolve into the electrolyte. When charged, copper ions can reduce on the anode as metallic copper. Over time, copper dendrites can form and cause a short in the same manner as lithium.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigh cycling rates and state of charge induces mechanical strain on the anode's graphite lattice. Mechanical strain caused by intercalation and de-intercalation creates fissures and splits of the graphite particles, changing their orientation. This orientation change results in capacity loss.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Electrolytes ====\nElectrolyte degradation mechanisms include hydrolysis and thermal decomposition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt concentrations as low as 10 ppm, water begins catalyzing a host of degradation products that can affect the electrolyte, anode and cathode.<ref name=\":0\" /> {{chem|LiPF|6}} participates in an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reaction with LiF and {{chem|PF|5}}. Under typical conditions, the equilibrium lies far to the left. However the presence of water generates substantial LiF, an insoluble, electrically insulating product. LiF binds to the anode surface, increasing film thickness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{chem|LiPF|6}} hydrolysis yields {{chem|PF|5}}, a strong [[Lewis acid]] that reacts with electron-rich species, such as water. {{chem|PF|5}} reacts with water to form [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) and [[phosphorus oxyfluoride]]. Phosphorus oxyfluoride in turn reacts to form additional HF and difluorohydroxy [[phosphoric acid]]. HF converts the rigid SEI film into a fragile one. On the cathode, the carbonate solvent can then diffuse onto the cathode oxide over time, releasing heat and thermal runaway.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDecomposition of electrolyte salts and interactions between the salts and solvent start at as low as 70 C. Significant decomposition occurs at higher temperatures. At 85 C [[transesterification]] products, such as dimethyl-2,5-dioxahexane carboxylate (DMDOHC)  are formed from EC reacting with DMC.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Cathode ====\nCathode degradation mechanisms include manganese dissolution, electrolyte oxidation and structural disorder.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn {{chem|LiMnO|4}} hydrofluoric acid catalyzes the loss of metallic manganese through disproportionation of trivalent manganese:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: 2Mn<sup>3+</sup> \u2192 Mn<sup>2+</sup>+ Mn<sup>4+</sup>\n\nMaterial loss of the spinel results in capacity fade. Temperatures as low as 50&nbsp;\u00b0C initiate Mn<sup>2+ </sup>deposition on the anode as metallic manganese with the same effects as lithium and copper plating.<ref name=\"2014JPS...262..129W\" /> Cycling over the theoretical max and min voltage plateaus destroys the [[crystal lattice]] via [[Jahn-Teller distortion]], which occurs when Mn<sup>4+</sup> is reduced to Mn<sup>3+</sup> during discharge.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStorage of a battery charged to greater than 3.6 V initiates electrolyte oxidation by the cathode and induces SEI layer formation on the cathode. As with the anode, excessive SEI formation forms an insulator resulting in capacity fade and uneven current distribution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStorage at less than 2 V results in the slow degradation of {{chem|LiCoO|2}} and {{chem|LiMn|2|O|4}} cathodes, the release of oxygen and irreversible capacity loss.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Conditioning ===\nThe need to \"condition\" [[NiCd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries has leaked into folklore surrounding Li-ion batteries, but is unfounded.
