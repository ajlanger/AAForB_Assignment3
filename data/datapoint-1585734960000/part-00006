Sharpe, 1996 {{ISBN|1-56324-864-6}} p. 26</ref>\n\nAs of January 2012, cow remains a divisive and controversial topic in India. Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. [[Madhya Pradesh]] enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. \n\nGujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits the killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Odisha, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producers and consumers of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing \"If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cows when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Indians split over cow ban|publisher=Asia Times| date=6 January 2012| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA06Df05.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cow slaughter ban: Using sensitivities to politically polarising ends works against democracy|date=10 January 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/editorial/cow-slaughter-ban-using-sensitivities-to-politically-polarising-ends-works-against-democracy/articleshow/11430557.cms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Livestock and poultry: world markets and trade|date=October 2011|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Indian cuisine}}\n{{multiple image\n | right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer = [[Indian cuisine]] is diverse, ranging from very spicy to very mild, varying with seasons in each region.

Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and [[Demographics of India|varied demographics]] of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories \u2013 [[North Indian cuisine|northern]], [[South Indian cuisine|southern]], eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many [[list of Indian spices|spices]] and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is [[vegetarian]], many Indian dishes also include meats like [[chicken]], [[mutton]], [[beef]] (both cow and buffalo), [[pork]] and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]] and the southern states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|title=Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals|year=1997|publisher=Serif|isbn=978-1-897959-50-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|Some Indian confectionery [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|desserts]] from hundreds of varieties.

Varied uses of spices are an integral part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish and create unique flavours and aromas. Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the [[Central Asia]]ns, [[Arabs]], [[Mughals]], and [[Colonialism in India|European colonists]].

Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]], [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]] built by Raja Raja Chola, the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]], [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[stupa]] (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at [[Bhattiprolu]].

[[Angkor Wat]], Borobudur and other [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.\n\nThe traditional system of [[Vaastu Shastra]] serves as India's version of [[Feng Shui]], influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or [[Prana]] in Sanskrit and [[Qi|Chi]]/[[Qi|Ki]] in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.\n\nWith the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] style of architecture. The [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] is one of the earliest examples.

The [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] and the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] are notable examples.\n\nIndian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or [[stupa]], temple spire or [[shikhara]], temple tower or [[pagoda]] and temple gate or [[torana]], have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The central spire is also sometimes called a [[Gopuram|vimanam]].

The [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharat]] were among the popular television series produced.

Hence the government started another channel that had part of national programming and part regional. This channel was known as DD 2 (later DD Metro). Both channels were broadcast terrestrially.\n\nIn 1991, the government liberated its markets, opening them up to [[cable television]]. Since then, there has been a spurt in the number of channels available. Today, the Indian small screen is a huge industry by itself and offers hundreds of programmes in almost all the regional languages of India. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind, some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps enjoy popularity among women of all classes.

With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.\n\n==Perceptions of Indian culture==\n{{Main|Stereotypes of South Asians}}\n[[File:Cropped Tripuri.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children prepare for a traditional dance in [[Tripura]]. The Tripuris, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.]]\nIndia's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of \"Indian culture\" is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of \"Indianness\" extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression \"Indian\" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)\n\nAccording to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society.<ref name=\"makar\">{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0QB43fNiTKkC&printsec=frontcover|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59869-211-2}}</ref> This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way, many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is [[Caste system in India|the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations]]. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 [[gotra]], the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas & sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The [[patriarch]] often resolves family issues.<ref name=\"makar\"/>\n\nOthers have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with [[C. K. Prahalad|C.K. Prahalad]] by [[Des Dearlove]], author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions, and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad \u2013 who was born in India and grew up there \u2013 claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On the verge of something extraordinary|author=Des Dearlove|author-link=Des Dearlove| journal=Business Strategy Review|date=Spring 2009|pages=17\u201320|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/109/index.html|ref=harv}}</ref> In another report, Nancy Lockwood of [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside the home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Amartya Sen]], the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonialism over centuries and current Western culture \u2013 both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 between India and the West.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|author=Amartya Sen|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-312-42602-6|url=https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Writings-History-Identity/dp/tags-on-product/031242602X}}</ref> There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised descriptions of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren't born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:\n* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, \"a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans.\"\n* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill's imperialist history thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While a great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.\n* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be freer from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, has an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.\n\nThe curatorial approach, one inspired by a systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.\n\n[[Susan Bayly]], in her book, observes that there is a considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of the pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India.

Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised.<ref name=rosser1>{{cite journal|title=Stereotypes in Schooling: Negative Pressures in the American Educational System on Hindu Identity Formation |journal=Teaching South Asia, A Journal of Pedagogy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=23\u201376 |url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094030/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |archivedate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref> Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments.

Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. [[Madhya Pradesh]] enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. \n\nGujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits the killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Odisha, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producers and consumers of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing \"If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cows when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Indians split over cow ban|publisher=Asia Times| date=6 January 2012| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA06Df05.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cow slaughter ban: Using sensitivities to politically polarising ends works against democracy|date=10 January 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/editorial/cow-slaughter-ban-using-sensitivities-to-politically-polarising-ends-works-against-democracy/articleshow/11430557.cms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Livestock and poultry: world markets and trade|date=October 2011|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Indian cuisine}}\n{{multiple image\n | right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer = [[Indian cuisine]] is diverse, ranging from very spicy to very mild, varying with seasons in each region.

Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and [[Demographics of India|varied demographics]] of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories \u2013 [[North Indian cuisine|northern]], [[South Indian cuisine|southern]], eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many [[list of Indian spices|spices]] and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is [[vegetarian]], many Indian dishes also include meats like [[chicken]], [[mutton]], [[beef]] (both cow and buffalo), [[pork]] and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]] and the southern states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|title=Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals|year=1997|publisher=Serif|isbn=978-1-897959-50-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|Some Indian confectionery [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|desserts]] from hundreds of varieties.

The classical form of old Indo-Aryan was ''Sanskrit'' meaning polished, cultivated and correct, in distinction to ''Prakrit'' \u2013 the practical language of the migrating masses evolving without concern to proper pronunciation or grammar, the structure of language changing as those masses mingled, settled new lands and adopted words from people of other native languages. ''Prakrita'' became middle Indo-Aryan leading to ''Pali'' (the language of early Buddhists and Ashoka era in 200\u2013300 BCE), ''Prakrit'' (the language of Jain philosophers) and ''Apabhramsa'' (the language blend at the final stage of middle Indo-Aryan). It is ''Apabhramsa'', scholars claim,<ref name=burrow1/> that flowered into Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, and many other languages now in use in India's north, east and west. All of these Indian languages have roots and structures similar to Sanskrit, to each other and to other Indo-European languages. Thus we have in India three thousand years of continuous linguistic history recorded and preserved in literary documents. This enables scholars to follow language evolution and observe how, by changes hardly noticeable from generation to generation, an original language alters into descendant languages that are now barely recognisable as the same.<ref name=burrow1/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n| width=\"200\" |{{Photomontage\n| photo1a = (1) Bandanna Sweet Pink.jpg{{!}}Bandanna\n| photo1b = A platinum bangle with diamonds.jpg{{!}}Bangle\n| photo2a = Bungalow, on the B4313, near Rosebush - geograph.org.uk - 1000849.jpg{{!}}Bungalow\n| photo2b = Hair wash with shampoo.jpg{{!}}Shampoo\n| spacing = 1\n| size = 200\n| foot_montage =Numerous words from India entered English vocabulary during the British colonial era.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18796493 Hobson-Jobson: The words English owes to India] M.J.

Among the present day artists, Atul Dodiya, Bose Krishnamacnahri, [[Devajyoti Ray]] and Shibu Natesan represent a new era of Indian art where global art shows direct amalgamation with Indian classical styles. These recent artists have acquired international recognition.

Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism developed further, India produced some extremely intricate [[bronze]]s as well as temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not constructed by using blocks but carved out of solid rock.\n\nSculptures produced in the northwest, in [[stucco]], [[schist]], or [[clay]], display a very strong blend of Indian and Classical [[Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]] influence. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] evolved almost simultaneously. During the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 6th centuries) sculpture reached a very high standard in execution and delicacy in modeling. These styles and others elsewhere in India evolved leading to classical Indian art that contributed to Buddhist and Hindu sculptures throughout Southeast Central and East Asia.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of India}}\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ellora Cave 16 si0308.jpg|[[Kailasa temple, Ellora|Kailasa temple]] is one of the largest [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] ancient [[Hindu]] temples located in [[Ellora]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].\nFile:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|The granite [[Gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].\nFile:Warangal fort.jpg|[[Kakatiya Kala Thoranam]] (Warangal Gate) built by the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in ruins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5889/|title=The Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>\nFile:Le temple de Chennakesava (Somanathapura, Inde) (14465165685).jpg|[[Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura|Chennakesava Temple]] is a model example of the [[Hoysala architecture]].\nFile:Chaturbhuj Temple, Orchha.jpg|[[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbhuj Temple]] at [[Orchha]], is noted for having one of the [[List_of_tallest_Gopurams#Tallest_Vimana|tallest Vimana]] among [[Hindu temple]]s standing at 344 feet.

The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. Some of its earliest production are found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (2600\u20131900 BC) which is characterised by well-planned cities and houses. [[Religion]] and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning and layout of these towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5892/|title=Dholavira: A Harappan City - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\n{{\nmultiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 250\n|image1     = Rani ki vav1.jpg\n|caption1   = [[Rani ki vav|Rani ki Vav]] (The Queen's stepwell) at [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]], [[Gujarat]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/922|title=Rani-ki-Vav (the Queen's Stepwell) at Patan, Gujarat|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n|image2     = View of Lord Nataraja at Temple museum.JPG\n|caption2   = Hall of Thousand Pillars at [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]]\n}}\nDuring the period of the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empires and their successors, several Buddhist architectural complexes, such as the caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]] were built. Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]], [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]] built by Raja Raja Chola, the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]], [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[stupa]] (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at [[Bhattiprolu]]. [[Rajput kingdoms]] oversaw the construction of [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Temple Complex]], [[Chittor Fort]] and [[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbhuj Temple]], etc. during their reign. [[Angkor Wat]], Borobudur and other [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.\n\nThe traditional system of [[Vaastu Shastra]] serves as India's version of [[Feng Shui]], influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or [[Prana]] in Sanskrit and [[Qi|Chi]]/[[Qi|Ki]] in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.\n\nWith the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] style of architecture. The [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] is one of the earliest examples.

The [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] and the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] are notable examples.\n\nIndian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or [[stupa]], temple spire or [[shikhara]], temple tower or [[pagoda]] and temple gate or [[torana]], have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The central spire is also sometimes called a [[Gopuram|vimanam]]. The southern temple gate, or [[gopuram]] is noted for its intricacy and majesty.\n\nContemporary [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]] is more cosmopolitan.

The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind, some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps enjoy popularity among women of all classes. Indian TV also consists of Western channels such as [[Cartoon Network]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[HBO]], and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]].\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Indian cinema\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Raja Harishchandra.jpg|A scene from ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), the first full-length Indian motion picture\nFile:Phalke.jpg|Producer-director-screenwriter [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], the \"father of Indian cinema\"\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n|}\n''[[Bollywood]]'' is the informal name given to the popular [[Mumbai]]-based [[film|film industry]] in India. Bollywood and the other major cinematic hubs (in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali Cinema]], [[Oriya film industry]], Assamese, Kannada, [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam]], Marathi, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Punjabi and Telugu) constitute the broader [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]], whose output is considered to be the largest in the world in terms of number of films produced and number of tickets sold.\n\nIndia has produced many cinema-makers like [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[J. C. Daniel]], [[Kasinathuni Viswanath]], [[Ram Gopal Varma]], [[Bapu (film director)|Bapu]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Guru Dutt]], [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]], [[Shaji N.

Balachander]] (see also: [[List of Indian film directors|Indian film directors]]). With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.\n\n==Perceptions of Indian culture==\n{{Main|Stereotypes of South Asians}}\n[[File:Cropped Tripuri.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children prepare for a traditional dance in [[Tripura]]. The Tripuris, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.]]\nIndia's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of \"Indian culture\" is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of \"Indianness\" extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression \"Indian\" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)\n\nAccording to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society.<ref name=\"makar\">{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0QB43fNiTKkC&printsec=frontcover|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59869-211-2}}</ref> This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way, many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is [[Caste system in India|the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations]]. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 [[gotra]], the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas & sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The [[patriarch]] often resolves family issues.<ref name=\"makar\"/>\n\nOthers have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with [[C. K. Prahalad|C.K. Prahalad]] by [[Des Dearlove]], author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions, and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad \u2013 who was born in India and grew up there \u2013 claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On the verge of something extraordinary|author=Des Dearlove|author-link=Des Dearlove| journal=Business Strategy Review|date=Spring 2009|pages=17\u201320|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/109/index.html|ref=harv}}</ref> In another report, Nancy Lockwood of [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside the home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Amartya Sen]], the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonialism over centuries and current Western culture \u2013 both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 between India and the West.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|author=Amartya Sen|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-312-42602-6|url=https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Writings-History-Identity/dp/tags-on-product/031242602X}}</ref> There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised descriptions of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren't born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:\n* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, \"a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans.\"\n* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill's imperialist history thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While a great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.\n* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be freer from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, has an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.\n\nThe curatorial approach, one inspired by a systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.\n\n[[Susan Bayly]], in her book, observes that there is a considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of the pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India. Bayly notes that much of the Indian subcontinent was populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste and strict social hierarchies were of only limited importance in their lifestyles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|author=Susan Bayly|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9780521264341}}</ref>\n\nTanisha Rathore from ''Thousand Miles Online Magazine'' wrote, \"Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi (since his government 2014) has taken many initiatives for a better environment, like to throw the trash in dustbins. I don\u2019t understand how graduates, post-graduates and sometimes doctorates fail to understand this; Trash should be thrown in bins which a toddler easily understands. Is this the successive evolution of the human brain in its educational years?\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thousandmilessite.in/coexistence-with-nature/|title=Coexistence With Nature {{!}} Articles|date=2019-02-25|website=Thousand Miles|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Rosser, an American sociologist, Americans of South Asian origins feel the Western perception of the culture of India has numerous stereotypes. Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised.<ref name=rosser1>{{cite journal|title=Stereotypes in Schooling: Negative Pressures in the American Educational System on Hindu Identity Formation |journal=Teaching South Asia, A Journal of Pedagogy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=23\u201376 |url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094030/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |archivedate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref> Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments. The study reports a stark contrast between Western perceptions of the culture of India, versus the direct experience of the interviewed people. For example:\n\n{{quotation|The presentation of South Asians is a standard pedagogic approach which runs quickly from the \"Cradle of Civilisation\"\u2014contrasting the Indus Valley with Egypt and Mesopotamia\u2014on past the Aryans, who were somehow our ancestors\u2014 to the poverty-stricken, superstitious, polytheistic, caste-ridden Hindu way of life&nbsp;... and then somehow magically culminates with a eulogy of Mahatma Gandhi. A typical textbook trope presents standard Ancient India Meets the Age of Expansion Approach with a colour photo of the Taj Mahal. There may be a sidebar on ahimsa or a chart of connecting circles graphically explaining samsara and reincarnation or illustrations of the four stages of life or the Four Noble Truths. Amid the dearth of real information, there may be found an entire page dedicated to a deity such as Indra or Varuna, who admittedly are rather an obscure vis-\u00e0-vis the beliefs of most modern Hindus.|A South Asian in America<ref name=rosser1/>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|India}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[North Indian Culture]]\n* [[South Indian culture]]\n* [[Culture of the Indian subcontinent]]\n* [[Etiquette of Indian dining]]\n* [[Indian religions]]\n* [[Lists of Indians by state]]\n* [[South Asian ethnic groups]]\n* [[Atithi Devo Bhav]]\n* [[Cultural Zones of India]]\n* [[Glossary of Indian culture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|40em}} \n*[[Aurobindo|Ghose, Aurobindo]]. 1998.
