After the war of Independence, Rahman became a brigade commander in Bangladesh Army, later the deputy chief of staff and Chief of staff of [[Bangladesh Army]].<ref name=\":1\" /> His ascent to leadership of the country resulted from a conspiracy that had begun with the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh, in a military coup d'\u00e9tat followed by a coups and counter-revolt within the military to gain control at the helm.\nZiaur Rahman gained ''de facto'' power as head of the government already under [[martial law]] imposed by the Mushtaq government. He took over the presidency in 1977.\n\nAs President in 1978, Rahman founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (popularly known by its abbreviation BNP). He reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets and accountability. Rahman inspired the nation to work hard and [[Bangladeshi nationalism|love the land]]. He initiated mass irrigation and food production programmes, including social programmes to uplift the lives of the people. He initiated and founded the first Asian regional group known as [[SAARC]]. Through his hard work and dedication the current Parliament House and Dhaka's international airport (now [[Shahjalal International Airport|HSIA]]) was materialized. Rahman became a popular world leader for his efforts to stabilize Bangladesh and championing issues affecting decolonised nations. He improved Bangladesh's relations with the West and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close alignment with India and the Soviet Union. Domestically, Rahman faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts for which trails were setup and many soldiers and officers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces were executed which were mostly claimed to be biased and false trails. He was criticised for passing the [[Indemnity Act, Bangladesh|Indemnity Act]] and removing the ban on religion-based political parties.\n\nRahman was awarded two  gallantry awards for two wars fought in South Asia. [[Hilal-i-Jurat]] for the Indo-Pak War in 1965, and Bir Uttom in 1972 for the Bangladesh Independence war 1971 for his wartime valor.

On 30 September, while the attention of the government was riveted on this crisis situation, due to spreading of panic and disinformation actions went under way in Bogra Cantonment where a revolt broke out. Although the revolt was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, another revolt started in Dhaka cantonment, led by misinformed airmen of [[Bangladesh Air Force]] (BAF). Armed group among this group of army and air force personnel unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed eleven(11) air force officers and 30 airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] BP (BDF Commander Bangladesh Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defence Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, while the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff [[Air vice-marshal|AVM]] AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as [[Provost Marshal]] of BAF. President Zia immediately appointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as [[ZMLA]] (Dhaka) and Director of Martial Law Communications and Control at Tejgaon (present day PM's Office). Government intelligence had failed and President Rahman promptly dismissed the DG-NSI and the DFI chief, [[Air Commodore|Air Cdre]] Aminul Islam Khan BAF, of 9th GD(P) formerly of [[Pakistan Air Force]], and also the . Hamidullah initiated the transfer of DFI under the ministry of defence from old Bailey Road office to Dhaka Cantonment under direct control of the president. In the aftermath at least 200 soldiers involved in the coup attempt were executed following a military trial, prompting some critics to call Ziaur Rahman \"ruthless\".<ref name=obt-nyt/>\n\nThe size of Bangladesh police forces was doubled and the number of soldiers of the army increased from 50,000 to 90,000.<ref name=\"pedia\"/> In 1978 he appointed [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] as the new [[Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army|Chief of Army Staff]], promoting him to the rank of [[lieutenant general]]. He was viewed as a professional soldier with no political aspirations (because of his imprisonment in former West Pakistan during the Bangladesh War of Independence) who possessed a soft corner for India.

Rahman reversed course from his predecessor Mujib's [[secular]], democratic socialist, pro-Indian policies. Rahman announced a \"19-point programme\" of economic emancipation which emphasised self-reliance, rural development, decentralisation, free markets and population control. Rahman spent much of his time travelling throughout the country, preaching the \"politics of hope\" and urging Bangladeshis to work harder and to produce more.

During this period, Bangladesh's economy achieved fast economic and industrial growth.<ref name=\"pedia\"/>\n\nRahman began reorienting Bangladesh's foreign policy, addressing the concerns of the mostly staunch rightists coupled with some renegade leftist who believed that Bangladesh was reliant on Indian economic and military aid. Rahman moved away from India and the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]], his predecessors' had worked with, developing closer relations with the United States and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East.<ref name=\"countrystudies.us\"/> Rahman also moved to harmonise ties with [[Saudi Arabia]] and the People's Republic of China, Pakistan's ally who had opposed Bangladesh's creation and had not recognised it until 1975. Rahman moved to normalise relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Rahman sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia's move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation's standing in the Middle East.<ref name=\"pedia\"/> According to historian Tazeen M. Murshid, one aim of these policies was to open the Gulf states to manpower exports.

After the war of Independence, Rahman became a brigade commander in Bangladesh Army, later the deputy chief of staff and Chief of staff of [[Bangladesh Army]].<ref name=\":1\" /> His ascent to leadership of the country resulted from a conspiracy that had begun with the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh, in a military coup d'\u00e9tat followed by a coups and counter-revolt within the military to gain control at the helm.\nZiaur Rahman gained ''de facto'' power as head of the government already under [[martial law]] imposed by the Mushtaq government. He took over the presidency in 1977.\n\nAs President in 1978, Rahman founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (popularly known by its abbreviation BNP). He reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets and accountability. Rahman inspired the nation to work hard and [[Bangladeshi nationalism|love the land]]. He initiated mass irrigation and food production programmes, including social programmes to uplift the lives of the people. He initiated and founded the first Asian regional group known as [[SAARC]]. Through his hard work and dedication the current Parliament House and Dhaka's international airport (now [[Shahjalal International Airport|HSIA]]) was materialized. Rahman became a popular world leader for his efforts to stabilize Bangladesh and championing issues affecting decolonised nations. He improved Bangladesh's relations with the West and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close alignment with India and the Soviet Union. Domestically, Rahman faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts for which trails were setup and many soldiers and officers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces were executed which were mostly claimed to be biased and false trails. He was criticised for passing the [[Indemnity Act, Bangladesh|Indemnity Act]] and removing the ban on religion-based political parties.\n\nRahman was awarded two  gallantry awards for two wars fought in South Asia. [[Hilal-i-Jurat]] for the Indo-Pak War in 1965, and Bir Uttom in 1972 for the Bangladesh Independence war 1971 for his wartime valor.

On 15 August 1975 President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated in a gun fight with army personnel. One of Mujibur Rahman's cabinet ministers and a leading conspirator [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]] gained the presidency and dismissed Major General [[K M Shafiullah]], appointed Major General Ziaur Rahman (then deputy chief of army staff) as army chief of staff. However, the coup of 15 August caused a period of instability and unrest in Bangladesh and amongst the rank and file of the armed forces. Brigadier [[Khaled Mosharraf]] and the 46th Brigade of [[Dhaka Cantonment]] under Colonel [[Shafat Jamil]] revolted against [[Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed]]'s administration on 3 November 1975, and Ziaur Rahman was forced to relinquish his post and put under house arrest. Hidden forces out of the dark came out of the woods in attempting to place a puppet administration in power. Instability, confusion and uncertainty with a dark atmosphere loomed over the major parts of the country. This was followed by (''Sipoy-Janata Biplob'') (Soldiers and People's Coup) (\"[[National Revolution and Solidarity Day]]\") on 7 November, a mutiny staged by the [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] (JSD or National Socialist Party) under retired Lieutenant Colonel [[Abu Taher]] and a group of socialist military officers.<ref name=\"JSTOR3\">{{cite journal |last1=Islam |first1=Syed Serajul |date=May 1984 |title=The State in Bangladesh under Zia (1975\u201381) |journal=Asian Survey |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=556\u2013573 |doi=10.1525/as.1984.24.5.01p0162r |jstor=2644413}}</ref> Khaled Mosharraf was killed and [[Colonel]] Jamil arrested, while Rahman was freed by the 2nd Artillery regiment under Lt.

A group of [[Japanese Red Army]] terrorists hijacked [[Japan Airlines Flight 472 (1977)|Japan Airlines Flight 472]] from [[India]] armed with weapons and ammunition and forced it to land in [[Dhaka International Airport|Tejgaon International Airport]]. On 30 September, while the attention of the government was riveted on this crisis situation, due to spreading of panic and disinformation actions went under way in Bogra Cantonment where a revolt broke out. Although the revolt was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, another revolt started in Dhaka cantonment, led by misinformed airmen of [[Bangladesh Air Force]] (BAF). Armed group among this group of army and air force personnel unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed eleven(11) air force officers and 30 airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] BP (BDF Commander Bangladesh Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defence Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, while the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff [[Air vice-marshal|AVM]] AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as [[Provost Marshal]] of BAF. President Zia immediately appointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as [[ZMLA]] (Dhaka) and Director of Martial Law Communications and Control at Tejgaon (present day PM's Office). Government intelligence had failed and President Rahman promptly dismissed the DG-NSI and the DFI chief, [[Air Commodore|Air Cdre]] Aminul Islam Khan BAF, of 9th GD(P) formerly of [[Pakistan Air Force]], and also the . Hamidullah initiated the transfer of DFI under the ministry of defence from old Bailey Road office to Dhaka Cantonment under direct control of the president.

Moving away from Mujib's secularism, Rahman asserted an Islamic political identity for Bangladesh and of membership in the wider community of Muslim nations, which was applauded by the general masses. However, these measures also isolated and embittered many ethnic and religious minorities in Bangladesh, in the opinion of many historians{{who|date=July 2015}} laying the foundations of future communal and ethnic conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, critics of this view point out that this is an oversimplification, and Rahman alone cannot be held responsible.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is generally acknowledged that he lived a simple life, which included opting to have his food supplied from the army canteen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n=== Family ===\nRahman was survived by his wife Begum Khaleda Zia and his son [[Tareq Rahman]].

In elections held in 1991, Begum Khaleda Zia led the BNP to victory and became prime minister. She lost the 1996 elections to the Awami League's [[Sheikh Hasina]], the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, but returned to power in 2001. Tareq Rahman serves as BNP senior joint secretary, regarded by many as the architect of the BNP's 2001 election victory and the mastermind of 21 August 2004 terrorist grenade attack on the top leadership of the then-opposition party Awami League including current prime minister Sheikh Hasina.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-111469 | title=It was Hawa Bhavan Plot | newspaper=The Daily Star | location=Bangladesh | date=26 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Honours===\n[[Turkey]] has named an important road in [[Ankara]] as Ziaur Rahman Caddesi after his death to honour him.<ref>[https://maps.google.com.bd/maps?q=%C3%87ankaya,+Ziaur+Rahman+Caddesi,+Ankara,+Turkey&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x14d34f88c9791223:0x7889d768f59b3edb,Ziaur+Rahman+Cd,+Ankara,+Turkey&gl=bd&ei=dWa2UrauM82jhgfg44HICQ&ved=0CCkQ8gEwAA \u00c7ankaya, Ziaur Rahman Caddesi, Ankara, Turkey - Google Maps].
