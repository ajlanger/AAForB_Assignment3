Schick received his [[habilitation]] in 2000 from the University of M\u00fcnster and is since 2001 a professor for pure mathematics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].\n\nHis research deals with topological invariants, ''e.g.'' <math>L^2</math>-invarianten and those invariants which result from the [[K-theory]] of [[operator algebra]]s. Such invariants arise in generalizations of the [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]]. \n\nSchick, with Wolfgang L\u00fcck, introduced the strong Atiyah conjecture. Given a discrete group G, the Atiyah conjecture states that the <math>L^2</math>-[[Betti number]]s of a finite [[CW-complex]] that has fundamental group G are integers, provided that G is torsion-free; furthermore, in the general case, the <math>L^2</math>-Betti numbers are rational numbers with denominators determined by the finite subgroups of G. In 2007 Schick, with Peter Linnell, proved a theorem which established conditions under which the Atiyah conjecture for a torsion-free group G implies the Atiyah conjecture for every finite extension of G; furthermore, they proved that the conditions are satisfied for a certain class of groups.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schick, T.|author2=Linnell, P.|title=Finite group extensions and the Atiyah conjecture|journal=Journal of the American Mathematical Society|volume=20|year=2007|pages=1003\u20131061|url=http://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/schick/publ/extAtiyah.html|arxiv=math/0403229|doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-07-00561-9}}</ref> In 2000 Schick proved the Atiyah conjecture for a large class of special cases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schick, T.|title=Integrality of <math>L^2</math> Betti numbers|journal=Mathematische Annalen|volume=317|issue=4|year=2000|pages=727\u2013750|doi=10.1007/PL00004421|arxiv=math/0001101}}</ref>.
