His photo \"[[Afghan Girl]]\", of a girl with piercing green eyes, has appeared on the cover of ''[[National Geographic]]'' several times. McCurry has photographed many assignments for ''National Geographic'' and has been a member of [[Magnum Photos]] since 1986.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gupmagazine.com/articles/its-all-mixed-an-interview-with-steve-mccurry|title=It's All Mixed: An Interview with Steve McCurry|last=Matthews|first=Katherine Oktober|date=November 13, 2013|website=GUP Magazine|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry is the recipient of numerous awards, including Magazine Photographer of the Year, awarded by the [[National Press Photographers Association]]; the [[Royal Photographic Society#Centenary Medal|Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal]];<ref name=\"rps-centenary-medal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.org/awards/history-and-recipients/centenary-medal |access-date=20 September 2015 |publisher=[[Royal Photographic Society]] |title=Centenary Medal}}</ref> and two first-place prizes in the [[World Press Photo]] contest (1985 and 1992).\n\n==Life and work==\nMcCurry attended [[Penn State University]]. He originally planned to study cinematography and filmmaking, but instead gained a degree in theater arts and graduated in 1974. He became interested in photography when he started taking pictures for the Penn State newspaper ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''.<ref name=\":2\">http://www.magnumphotos.com/Archive/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.Biography_VPage&AID=2K7O3R1312JM Biography on ''[[Magnum Photos]]''</ref>\n\nAfter a year working in India, McCurry traveled to northern Pakistan where he met two Afghans who told him about the war across the border in Afghanistan.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2003 |title=Q&A With Steve McCurry |url=http://www.pdngallery.com/global/en/professional/features/legendsV6Q1/qa.pdf |magazine=PDN |access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry's career was launched when, disguised in Afghani garb, he crossed the [[Pakistan]] border into rebel-controlled areas of [[Afghanistan]] just before [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|the Soviet invasion]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/23/world/steve-mccurry-afghan-girl-photo/ |title=The story behind the world's most famous photograph |last=Wallis Simons |first=Jake |date=June 29, 2015 |publisher=CNN |access-date=June 7, 2016 |quote=...disguised himself in Afghan clothes and crossed illegally into Afghanistan, just before the Soviet invasion.}}</ref> \"As soon as I crossed the border, I came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out,\" he says.

There have been a couple of dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent contributor to National Geographic.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMcCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. \"Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the \"human connection between all of us.\" He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc.<ref name=\":1\" /> McCurry also states, \"I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some \"horrific\" and \"distressing\" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a \"shield\" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, he didn't know it was a plane that hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, \"they were just gone. It didn\u2019t seem possible. Like you\u2019re seeing something but you don\u2019t really believe what you\u2019re seeing.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanphotomag.com/steve-mccurry-ground-zero-photographs#page-2|title=Steve McCurry: The Ground Zero Photographs|work=American Photo|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}</ref> After the fall of the towers, McCurry ran to Ground Zero with his assistant. He describes the scene, \"there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipment\u2014no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized.\" McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security. He was eventually caught and escorted off Ground Zero, he wouldn't go back again.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMcCurry is portrayed in a TV documentary ''The Face of the Human Condition'' (2003) by [[Denis Delestrac]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.all-about-photo.com/photographers/photographer.php?id=81&name=steve-mccurry|title=Steve McCurry Photographer - All About Photo|last=all-about-photo.com|website=www.all-about-photo.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry switched from shooting color slide film to digital capture in 2005 for the convenience of editing in the field and transmitting images to photo editors. He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]].'' \"Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over... The quality has never been better. You can work in extremely low light situations, for example.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/28/steve-mccurry-photography |title=US photographer Steve McCurry: Go with the flow |last=Iqbal |first=Nosheen |date=June 28, 2010 |website=The Guardian |access-date=June 7, 2016 |quote=He is practical about the benefits and has little patience for the nostalgic romance surrounding photographers who work only with film.}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry shoots in both film and digital, but says he prefers shooting with transparency film. Eastman Kodak gifted him the last roll of [[Kodachrome]] film to ever be produced by [[Kodak]]. McCurry shot the roll, which was processed in July 2010 by Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas. Most of these photos were published on the Internet by Vanity Fair. McCurry states, \"I shot it for 30 years and I have several hundred thousand pictures on Kodachrome in my archive. I'm trying to shoot 36 pictures that act as some kind of wrap up \u2013 to mark the passing of Kodachrome. It was a wonderful film.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laurarathe.com/artists/steve-mccurry/featured-works?view=thumbnails|title=Steve McCurry - Artists - LAURA RATHE FINE ART|website=www.laurarathe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he was hired by [[Microsoft]] to take photographs in areas of [[New Zealand]], which were used as wallpapers in [[Windows 10]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maryleejohnson.com/Windows-10-Wallpaper-Photography-Steve-McCurry|title=Windows 10 Wallpaper Photography - Steve McCurry|last=Johnson|first=Marylee|website=maryleejohnson.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, his book ''Steve McCurry.

The photo has also been widely used on [[Amnesty International]] brochures, posters, and calendars. The identity of the \"Afghan Girl\" remained unknown for over 17 years until McCurry and a ''National Geographic'' team located the woman, [[Sharbat Gula]], in 2002. McCurry said, \"Her skin is weathered; there are wrinkles now, but she is as striking as she was all those years ago.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://barbizon.besharatgallery.com/en/artistes/steve-mccurry-2/|title=Steve McCurry - Besharat Gallery|publisher=Besharat Gallery|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===\"Afghan Girl\" controversy===\nIn 2019, a small but growing vlogger and professional photographer by the name of [[Tony Northrup]] released a research documentary accusing McCurry of obtaining the photograph under false pretenses, and endangering Gula's wellbeing in doing so.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thewire.in/media/afghan-girl-steve-mccurry-national-geographic|title=You'll never see the iconic photo of the 'Afghan Girl' the same way again|publisher=The Wire(India)|access-date=2020-02-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> McCurry's publicity team responded by accusing Northrup of slander, and the clip was removed.

He originally planned to study cinematography and filmmaking, but instead gained a degree in theater arts and graduated in 1974. He became interested in photography when he started taking pictures for the Penn State newspaper ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''.<ref name=\":2\">http://www.magnumphotos.com/Archive/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.Biography_VPage&AID=2K7O3R1312JM Biography on ''[[Magnum Photos]]''</ref>\n\nAfter a year working in India, McCurry traveled to northern Pakistan where he met two Afghans who told him about the war across the border in Afghanistan.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2003 |title=Q&A With Steve McCurry |url=http://www.pdngallery.com/global/en/professional/features/legendsV6Q1/qa.pdf |magazine=PDN |access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry's career was launched when, disguised in Afghani garb, he crossed the [[Pakistan]] border into rebel-controlled areas of [[Afghanistan]] just before [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|the Soviet invasion]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/23/world/steve-mccurry-afghan-girl-photo/ |title=The story behind the world's most famous photograph |last=Wallis Simons |first=Jake |date=June 29, 2015 |publisher=CNN |access-date=June 7, 2016 |quote=...disguised himself in Afghan clothes and crossed illegally into Afghanistan, just before the Soviet invasion.}}</ref> \"As soon as I crossed the border, I came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out,\" he says.

There have been a couple of dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent contributor to National Geographic.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMcCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. \"Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the \"human connection between all of us.\" He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc.<ref name=\":1\" /> McCurry also states, \"I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some \"horrific\" and \"distressing\" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a \"shield\" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, he didn't know it was a plane that hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, \"they were just gone. It didn\u2019t seem possible. Like you\u2019re seeing something but you don\u2019t really believe what you\u2019re seeing.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanphotomag.com/steve-mccurry-ground-zero-photographs#page-2|title=Steve McCurry: The Ground Zero Photographs|work=American Photo|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}</ref> After the fall of the towers, McCurry ran to Ground Zero with his assistant. He describes the scene, \"there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipment\u2014no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized.\" McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security. He was eventually caught and escorted off Ground Zero, he wouldn't go back again.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMcCurry is portrayed in a TV documentary ''The Face of the Human Condition'' (2003) by [[Denis Delestrac]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.all-about-photo.com/photographers/photographer.php?id=81&name=steve-mccurry|title=Steve McCurry Photographer - All About Photo|last=all-about-photo.com|website=www.all-about-photo.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry switched from shooting color slide film to digital capture in 2005 for the convenience of editing in the field and transmitting images to photo editors. He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]].'' \"Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over... The quality has never been better. You can work in extremely low light situations, for example.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/28/steve-mccurry-photography |title=US photographer Steve McCurry: Go with the flow |last=Iqbal |first=Nosheen |date=June 28, 2010 |website=The Guardian |access-date=June 7, 2016 |quote=He is practical about the benefits and has little patience for the nostalgic romance surrounding photographers who work only with film.}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry shoots in both film and digital, but says he prefers shooting with transparency film. Eastman Kodak gifted him the last roll of [[Kodachrome]] film to ever be produced by [[Kodak]]. McCurry shot the roll, which was processed in July 2010 by Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas. Most of these photos were published on the Internet by Vanity Fair. McCurry states, \"I shot it for 30 years and I have several hundred thousand pictures on Kodachrome in my archive. I'm trying to shoot 36 pictures that act as some kind of wrap up \u2013 to mark the passing of Kodachrome. It was a wonderful film.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laurarathe.com/artists/steve-mccurry/featured-works?view=thumbnails|title=Steve McCurry - Artists - LAURA RATHE FINE ART|website=www.laurarathe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he was hired by [[Microsoft]] to take photographs in areas of [[New Zealand]], which were used as wallpapers in [[Windows 10]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maryleejohnson.com/Windows-10-Wallpaper-Photography-Steve-McCurry|title=Windows 10 Wallpaper Photography - Steve McCurry|last=Johnson|first=Marylee|website=maryleejohnson.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, his book ''Steve McCurry.

The photo has also been widely used on [[Amnesty International]] brochures, posters, and calendars. The identity of the \"Afghan Girl\" remained unknown for over 17 years until McCurry and a ''National Geographic'' team located the woman, [[Sharbat Gula]], in 2002.
