{"title_page": "Media dispenser", "text_new": "[[File:Syringe pump, Lambda VIT-FIT.jpg|thumb|Syringe pump|150px]]\n\n\nA '''media dispenser''' or a '''culture media dispenser''' is a device for repeatedly delivering small fixed volumes (typically between 1&nbsp;ml and 50&nbsp;ml) of liquid such as a laboratory [[growth medium]] like molten [[agar]] or caustic or volatile solvents like [[toluene]] into a series of receptacles ([[Petri dish]]es, [[test tube]]s, [[Fernbach flask]]s, etc.). It is often important that such dispensers operate without biological or chemical contamination, and so must be internally sealed from the environment and designed for easy cleaning and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] before use. At a minimum, a media dispenser consists of some kind of [[pump]] connected to a length of discharge tubing or a spout. Dispensers used in laboratories are also frequently connected to [[microcontroller]]s to regulate the speed and volume of the medium as it leaves the pump.\n\nThere are also automatic media dispenser available like.  \u2018CORTO\u2019 Glass Syringe Pump media dispenser. It is a Repetitive dispenser for fluid transfer that facilitates repeatable dosage distribution. The System offers a user-friendly design for fluid transfer - without the capital investment required for filling pumps. The device is for use with a wide variety of reservoirs, including vials, syringes, oral medication containers. Also used for drug dosage distribution and reconstitution in hospital pharmacies.\n\nCORTO\u2019 Glass Syringe Pipettors, have contoured finger rings and thumb rest that allows effortless, non-fatiguing one-handed operation.\n\n\nThese features provide for self-refilling , allowing continuous pipetting from a single liquid reservoir. The pipettors are easily assembled.\u00a0 All units are autoclavable and are ideal for use with sterile media during aseptic techniques.\n\n* Simple screw adjustment for accurate volume setting.\n* Automatic return of spring loaded plunger to preset volume for quick repeat dispensing.\n* Convenient finger-holds for effortless single hand operation.\n* Filling assembly attachment enables continuous refilling from reservoir and repetitive delivery of preset volumes.\n* Unique design of stainless steel bivalve and sinker ensures smooth, leakproof liquid transfer.\n* Simple Natural Movements\n* Plunger Tightness without \u2018O\u2019 Ring\n* Volume Selection\n* Low Maintenance\n* [[File:Media-dispenser-top.jpg|alt=Media-dispenser|thumb|Media-dispenser]]\n\nLaboratory media dispensers may include the following, among others: floating piston designs, [[syringe driver|syringe pumps]], [[peristaltic pump]]s, [[pipette]]s or pipettors, and [[pressure injection cell]]s.

This type involves a piston on a [[plunger]] which is pushed down against a spring: as the spring pushes the piston back into its original position, it draws the medium up from a reservoir underneath.

However, they can only effectively transport one or two fills at a time, and, unless filled from the rear, the tube tip must constantly be reinserted into the source vessel in order to be refilled which creates a repeated opportunity for [[contamination]]. They also require the user to do more work than any other type of dispenser both in terms of time to fill a receptacle and energy necessary to make sure each fill is precise and accurate (digital pipette models may work faster and require less work per fill from the user than manual ones, though these are then subject to the availability of electricity and the possibility of mechanical failure).
