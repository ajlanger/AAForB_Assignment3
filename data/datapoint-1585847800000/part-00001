Bulara's childless sister-in-law Debo (Neena Cheema) treats him like her own son.\n\nBulara's elder sister Kaki (Sukhwinder Grewal) falls for the young athlete Kangan ( Kriashan Arora) who lives in neighbourhood and is a friend, philosopher and guide for Bulara. The upright person leaves the village as a reaction to Kaki's advances.\n\nBulara is now a lonely directionless person and seduces the gypsy girl Naini (Amarjeet). He becomes aware that she died after becoming pregnant and runs away to a temple with his childhood friend Bhikhu (Pramod Kalia). Ratta suppresses the case by bribing the police inspector. He stays at a temple for some time and then leaves on an endless journey as an ascetic.\n\nDebo remains childless and had always been ill treated by her in-laws.
