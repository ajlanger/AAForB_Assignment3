He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R. Chopra]] over the production of the series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' based on [[Mahabharata|another epic of the same name]], and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=S.

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

S. Gill wrote that it was during his tenure as the secretary with the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]] in September 1985 that he contacted [[Ramanand Sagar]] in association with the project. Gill added that in a letter to Sagar, he had written about the Ramayana as a subject for the television series was ideal in that it was \"a repository of moral and social values\" and that its message was \"secular and universal\". He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R. Chopra]] over the production of the series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' based on [[Mahabharata|another epic of the same name]], and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=S.

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!
