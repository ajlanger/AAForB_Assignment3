With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first]] [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956, and the Governor-General was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent Governor-General, [[Iskander Mirza]], became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|suspended the]] first Constitution in 1958, and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Army Commander-in-Chief]] General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] as the first [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|chief martial law administrator]]. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|223x223px|[[Iskander Mirza]] became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956. ]]\nThe [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second]] Constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a [[presidential republic]] without [[Elections in Pakistan|direct elections]]. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, [[Fatima Jinnah]], for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Khan.\n\n[[File:Presidential standard of Pakistan (1974\u20131998).svg|thumb|left|200px|Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)]]\nControversy regarding the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]] (1960), [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]] (1963), and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|war]] with [[India]] (1965), fueled a fierce [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] opposition movement led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from [[paralysis]] and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General [[Yahya Khan]], [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|who imposed martial law]] and announced that nationwide elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in 1970 which saw the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) and the [[Awami League]] gaining a majority in [[East Pakistan]] (current day Bangladesh).\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited [[Nurul Amin]] of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], and also appointed him as the first [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice President]]. The growing instigated violence against [[Pakistanis]] in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use [[Operation Searchlight|force]] in order to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|order]] there, which further escalated [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bengali resistance]] (1970).  [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Preemptive strikes]] against [[India]] led to another [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war]] in 1971, which [[Independence of Bangladesh|freed]] [[East Pakistan]] and created [[Bangladesh]].\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of [[Pakistan]] after the [[Fall of Dhaka|fall]] of [[East Pakistan]], President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. President Bhutto created the current [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1973, transforming [[Pakistan]] into a [[parliamentary democracy]], and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]].\n\n===Past Interventions===\nThe [[1977 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|right-wing]] alliance, the [[Pakistan National Alliance]]. The events leading to it resulted in [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]]. Suspending the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] in 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's [[Zia regime|presidency]] oversaw the modern growth of [[Islamic fundamentalism|far-right ideas]] in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] held a [[1984 Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum|referendum]] (1984) and called for [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1985. President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] appointed [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Mohammad Junejo]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and assumed more [[Political power|powers]] through the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]]. After dismissing [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Junejo]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] announced that new [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] would be held, but President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|died in a plane crash]] in 1988.\n\nThe [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1988 witnessed the victory of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] in 1988, and appointed [[Chairman Senate]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] to the presidency. Conflict between [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] repeatedly intervened in government matters and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|leveled charges]] against [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]; thus [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1990. After holding [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1990, [[Nawaz Sharif]] brought up an ideologically [[First Sharif ministry|conservative government]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Allam]], President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] tendered resignations in 1993.\n\nFollowing the [[1993 Pakistani general election|new elections]] held in 1993, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] established a strong government after appointing loyalist [[Farooq Leghari]] to the presidency. However, the [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corruption charges]] and the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]] in 1996 resulted in President [[Farooq Leghari]] [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In 1997, President [[Farooq Leghari]] could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] by the public in [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997]].  President [[Farooq Leghari|Leghari]] unsuccessfully supported [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]]\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Executive]], and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. After appointing [[Rafiq Tarar]], the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] successfully passed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|self coup]] in 1999, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and President [[Rafiq Tarar]] in 2001 while assuming more [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|powers to the presidency]].

With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first]] [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956, and the Governor-General was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent Governor-General, [[Iskander Mirza]], became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|suspended the]] first Constitution in 1958, and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Army Commander-in-Chief]] General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] as the first [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|chief martial law administrator]]. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|223x223px|[[Iskander Mirza]] became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956. ]]\nThe [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second]] Constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a [[presidential republic]] without [[Elections in Pakistan|direct elections]]. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, [[Fatima Jinnah]], for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Khan.\n\n[[File:Presidential standard of Pakistan (1974\u20131998).svg|thumb|left|200px|Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)]]\nControversy regarding the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]] (1960), [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]] (1963), and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|war]] with [[India]] (1965), fueled a fierce [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] opposition movement led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from [[paralysis]] and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General [[Yahya Khan]], [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|who imposed martial law]] and announced that nationwide elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in 1970 which saw the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) and the [[Awami League]] gaining a majority in [[East Pakistan]] (current day Bangladesh).\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited [[Nurul Amin]] of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], and also appointed him as the first [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice President]]. The growing instigated violence against [[Pakistanis]] in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use [[Operation Searchlight|force]] in order to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|order]] there, which further escalated [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bengali resistance]] (1970).  [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Preemptive strikes]] against [[India]] led to another [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war]] in 1971, which [[Independence of Bangladesh|freed]] [[East Pakistan]] and created [[Bangladesh]].\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of [[Pakistan]] after the [[Fall of Dhaka|fall]] of [[East Pakistan]], President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. President Bhutto created the current [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1973, transforming [[Pakistan]] into a [[parliamentary democracy]], and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]].\n\n===Past Interventions===\nThe [[1977 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|right-wing]] alliance, the [[Pakistan National Alliance]]. The events leading to it resulted in [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]]. Suspending the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] in 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's [[Zia regime|presidency]] oversaw the modern growth of [[Islamic fundamentalism|far-right ideas]] in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] held a [[1984 Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum|referendum]] (1984) and called for [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1985. President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] appointed [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Mohammad Junejo]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and assumed more [[Political power|powers]] through the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]]. After dismissing [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Junejo]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] announced that new [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] would be held, but President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|died in a plane crash]] in 1988.\n\nThe [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1988 witnessed the victory of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] in 1988, and appointed [[Chairman Senate]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] to the presidency. Conflict between [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] repeatedly intervened in government matters and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|leveled charges]] against [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]; thus [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1990. After holding [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1990, [[Nawaz Sharif]] brought up an ideologically [[First Sharif ministry|conservative government]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Allam]], President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] tendered resignations in 1993.\n\nFollowing the [[1993 Pakistani general election|new elections]] held in 1993, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] established a strong government after appointing loyalist [[Farooq Leghari]] to the presidency. However, the [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corruption charges]] and the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]] in 1996 resulted in President [[Farooq Leghari]] [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In 1997, President [[Farooq Leghari]] could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] by the public in [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997]].  President [[Farooq Leghari|Leghari]] unsuccessfully supported [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]]\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Executive]], and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. After appointing [[Rafiq Tarar]], the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] successfully passed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|self coup]] in 1999, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and President [[Rafiq Tarar]] in 2001 while assuming more [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|powers to the presidency]].  In January 2004, the [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] [[2004 Pakistani presidential election|elected]] Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Amy|title=Pakistan Gives Musharraf Confidence Vote as President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515004758/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|archivedate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary,]] and declared a [[2007 Pakistani martial law|state of emergency]] in 2007, after dismissing the [[List of Justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]]. Although Musharraf was [[2007 Pakistani presidential election|elected in 2007]], the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious.
