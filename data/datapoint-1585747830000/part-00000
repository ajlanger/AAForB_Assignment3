The [[United Kingdom]] took in nearly 10,000 predominantly [[Jewish]] children from [[Nazi Germany]], Nazi-occupied [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and the [[Free City of Danzig]]. The children were placed in British [[foster homes]], [[hostels]], schools and farms. Often they were the only members of their families who survived [[the Holocaust]]. The programme was supported, publicised and encouraged by the British government. Importantly the British government waived all those visa immigration requirements which were not within the ability of the British Jewish community to fulfil.<ref name=KinderJuly2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/kindertransport.htm |title=Kindertransport |date=July 2009 |publisher=History Learning Site |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=NHC1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holocaust.org.uk/kindertransport-overview|title=Kindertransport; Organising and Rescue|website=The National Holocaust Centre and Museum|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> The British government put no number limit on the programme \u2013 it was the start of World War II that brought the programme to an end, at which time about 10,000 kindertransport children had been brought to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe term \"kindertransport\" is also sometimes used for the rescue of mainly Jewish children, but without their parents, from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

That bill stated that the government would waive certain immigration requirements so as to allow the entry into Great Britain of unaccompanied children ranging from infants up to the age of 17, under conditions as outlined in the next paragraph. No limit upon the permitted number of refugees was ever publicly announced. Initially, the Jewish refugee agencies considered 5,000 as a realistic target goal. However, after the [[British Colonial Office]] turned down the Jewish agencies' separate request to allow the admission of 10,000 children to British-controlled [[Mandate Palestine|Palestine]], the Jewish agencies then increased their planned target number to 15,000 unaccompanied children to enter Great Britain in this way.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport.jpg|thumb|1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport]]\n\nOn the eve of a major [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on refugees on 21 November 1938, [[Home Secretary]] [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] met a large delegation representing Jewish, as well as Quaker and other non-Jewish groups, working on behalf of refugees.

The exact details of this trauma, and how it was felt by the child, depended both on the child's age at separation, and the details of his or her total experience until the end of the war, and importantly even after that.\n\nThe primary trauma was the actual \"parting\" from the parents, and the age of the Kinder at the time. How this parting was \"explained\" was very important, for example, \"you are going on an exciting adventure,\" or \"you are going on a short trip and we will see you soon.\"  Except that, for younger children, perhaps six and younger, they generally would not accept such an explanation and would demand to stay with their parents. There are many records of tears and screaming at the various train-stations where the actual parting took place. Even for older, \"more willing to accept the parents' \"explanation,\" at some point that child realised that he or she would be separated from his or her parents for a long and indefinite time. The younger Kinder had no developed sense of time, and for them the trauma of separation was total from the very beginning.\n\nHaving to learn a new language in a situation where the German or Czech native language was not understood was a stressor. To have to learn to live with strangers, who only spoke English, and accept them as \"pseudo-parents\" was a trauma. At school, the English children would often view the Kinder as \"enemy Germans\" instead of as \"Jewish refugees\".\n\nBefore WWII's start on Sept 1, 1939, and even during the first part of the war, some parents were able to escape from Hitler and reach England and then reunite with their children. But this was the exception; most of the parents were murdered by the Nazis.\n \nThe older ones became fully aware of the war in Europe during 1939-1945 and its actual details, and they would understand and become concerned for their parents. During the later part of the war, they may have become aware of the [[Holocaust]] and the actual direct threat to their Jewish parents and extended family. At the end of WWII in 1945, nearly all the Kinder would sooner or later learn that their parents had been murdered. <ref>[[Dawidowicz, Lucy|Lucy Dawidowicz]] (1986), ''The War Against the Jews.''

He warned the British government, through Lord Samuel, of the impending Kristallnacht in November 1938. Through a British agent, [[Frank Foley]], passport officer at the Berlin consulate, he kept British intelligence informed of Nazi activities. Speaking on behalf of the ''{{lang|de|Reichsvertretung}}'' (the German Jewish communal organisation) and the ''{{lang|de|Hilfsverein}}'' (the self-help body), he urged a plan of rescue on the Foreign Office and helped British [[Quaker]]s to visit Jewish communities all over Germany to prove to the British government that Jewish parents were indeed prepared to part with their children.<ref>Naomi Shepherd: ''A Refuge from Darkness'' Pantheon books, New York, 1984.

He housed many of them in his London home for a while. During the Blitz he found for them in the countryside often non-Jewish foster homes. In order to assure the children follow Jewish dietary laws (Kosher) he instructed them to say to the foster parents that they are fish eating vegetarians. He also saved large numbers of Jews with South American protection papers. He brought over to England several thousand young people, rabbis, teachers, ritual slaughterers and other religious functionaries.<ref>See the entry [[Solomon Schonfeld]], and the book ''Holocaust Hero: Solomon Schonfeld'', by Dr. Kranzler (Ktav Publishing House, New Jersey, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Internment and war service==\nIn 1940, the British government ordered the internment of all male 16- to 70-year-old refugees from enemy countries&nbsp;\u2013 so-called ''friendly [[enemy aliens]]''. Many of the children who had arrived in earlier years were now young men, and so they were also interned. Approximately 1,000 of these ''prior-kinder'' were interned in these makeshift [[List of concentration and internment camps|internment camps]], many on the [[Isle of Man]]. Around 400 were transported overseas to Canada and Australia (see [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']]).\n\nAs the camp internees reached the age of 18, they were offered the chance to do war work or to enter the Army Auxiliary [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]]. About 1,000 German and Austrian ''prior-kinder'' who reached adulthood went on to serve in the British armed forces, including in combat units. Several dozen joined elite formations such as the [[Special forces#Britain|Special Forces]], where their language skills were put to good use during the [[D-Day Invasion]] and afterwards as the Allies progressed into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].\n\nThe British internment period for ''friendly enemy aliens'' generally lasted only a few months, until they were processed by the government and released.\n\n==\"American Kindertransport\"==\n{{main|One Thousand Children}}\nThe One Thousand Children (OTC) was a similar but much less organised effort to transport unaccompanied children, mostly Jewish, to the United States. The programme brought about 1,400 children aged between 14 months and 16 years to the United States between November 1934 and May 1945. Like the ''kinder'', these OTC children were forced to leave their parents behind in Europe; many of them were later murdered by the Nazis.\n\nIn contrast to the Kindertransport, where the British Government waived immigration visa requirements, these OTC children received no United States Government visa immigration assistance. Furthermore, it is documented that the State Department deliberately made it very difficult for any Jewish refugee to get an entrance visa.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941\u20131945]] |last= Wyman |first= David S. | authorlink= David Wyman |edition= |origyear= |year= 1984 |publisher= [[Pantheon Books]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-394-42813-7 |pages= 124\u2013142 }}</ref> And it was even harder to secure the appropriate papers for their parents, hence most had to remain in Europe.\n\nIn 1939 Sen.

On board the train were several surviving ''Winton children'' and their descendants, who were to be welcomed by the now hundred-year-old Sir [[Nicholas Winton]] in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the intended last Kindertransport, which was due to set off on 3 September 1939 but did not because of the outbreak of the Second World War. At the train's departure, Sir Nicholas Winton's statue was unveiled at the railway station.<ref>{{cite web|last=\u010cTK |title=Train in honour of Jewish children rescuer Winton leaves Prague |url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/train-in-honour-of-jewish-children-rescuer-winton-leaves-prague/395346 |date=1 September 2009 |work=\u010cesk\u00e9 noviny |publisher=Neris s.r.o. |accessdate=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904103942/http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/train-in-honour-of-jewish-children-rescuer-winton-leaves-prague/395346 |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Academic debate ==\nJessica Reinisch notes how the British media and politicians alike allude to the Kindertransport in contemporary debates on refugee and migration crises. She argues that \"the Kindertransport\" is used as evidence of Britain's \"proud tradition\" of taking in refugees; but that such allusions are problematic as the Kinderstransport model is taken out of context and thus subject to [[nostalgia]]. She points out that countries such as Britain and the United States did much to prevent immigration by turning desperate people away; at the [[\u00c9vian Conference]] in 1938, participant nations failed to reach agreement about accepting Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-matters-but-which-one-every-refugee-crisis-has-a-context|title=History matters\u2026 but which one?

'''''Kindertransport''''' (German for \"children's transport\") was an organised rescue effort that took place during the nine months prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. The [[United Kingdom]] took in nearly 10,000 predominantly [[Jewish]] children from [[Nazi Germany]], Nazi-occupied [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and the [[Free City of Danzig]]. The children were placed in British [[foster homes]], [[hostels]], schools and farms. Often they were the only members of their families who survived [[the Holocaust]]. The programme was supported, publicised and encouraged by the British government. Importantly the British government waived all those visa immigration requirements which were not within the ability of the British Jewish community to fulfil.<ref name=KinderJuly2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/kindertransport.htm |title=Kindertransport |date=July 2009 |publisher=History Learning Site |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=NHC1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holocaust.org.uk/kindertransport-overview|title=Kindertransport; Organising and Rescue|website=The National Holocaust Centre and Museum|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> The British government put no number limit on the programme \u2013 it was the start of World War II that brought the programme to an end, at which time about 10,000 kindertransport children had been brought to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe term \"kindertransport\" is also sometimes used for the rescue of mainly Jewish children, but without their parents, from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An example is the 1,000 [[Chateau de La Hille]] children who went to Belgium.<ref name=NHC1/><ref name=\"NYT1938\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/12/06/archives/600-child-refugees-taken-from-vienna-100-jewish-youngsters-going-to.html|title=600 Child Refugees Taken From Vienna; 100 Jewish Youngsters Going to Netherlands, 500 to England|last=|first=|date=6 December 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=29 March 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> However, often, the \"kindertransport\" is used to refer to the organised programme to the United Kingdom.\n\n[[World Jewish Relief]] (then called the Central British Fund for German Jewry) was established in 1933 to support in whatever way possible the needs of Jews both in Germany and Austria. Records for many of the children who arrived in the UK through the ''Kindertransports'' are maintained by World Jewish Relief.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe British Kindertransport programme was unique \u2013 no other country had a similar programme.

Among other measures, they requested that the British government permit the temporary admission of unaccompanied Jewish children, without their parents.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] debated the issue the next day and subsequently prepared a bill to present to the United Kingdom's Parliament. That bill stated that the government would waive certain immigration requirements so as to allow the entry into Great Britain of unaccompanied children ranging from infants up to the age of 17, under conditions as outlined in the next paragraph. No limit upon the permitted number of refugees was ever publicly announced. Initially, the Jewish refugee agencies considered 5,000 as a realistic target goal. However, after the [[British Colonial Office]] turned down the Jewish agencies' separate request to allow the admission of 10,000 children to British-controlled [[Mandate Palestine|Palestine]], the Jewish agencies then increased their planned target number to 15,000 unaccompanied children to enter Great Britain in this way.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport.jpg|thumb|1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport]]\n\nOn the eve of a major [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on refugees on 21 November 1938, [[Home Secretary]] [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] met a large delegation representing Jewish, as well as Quaker and other non-Jewish groups, working on behalf of refugees.

This ship was the very last to leave the country freely.\n\nAs the Netherlands was under attack by German forces totalling 750,000 men from May 10, and bombings had been going on, there was no opportunity to confer with the parents of the children. At the time of this evacuation, these parents knew nothing of the evacuation of their children: according to unnamed sources, some of the parents were initially even very upset about this action and told Wijsmuller-Meijer she should not have done this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} After May 15, there was no more opportunity to leave the Netherlands, as the country's borders were closed by the Nazis.\n\n==Trauma suffered by Kinder==\n\nThe Kinder (German for \"children\") went through extreme trauma during their extensive Kindertransport experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holocaust.org.uk/kindertransport|title=Kindertransport|website=The National Holocaust Centre and Museum|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> This is often presented in very personal terms. The exact details of this trauma, and how it was felt by the child, depended both on the child's age at separation, and the details of his or her total experience until the end of the war, and importantly even after that.\n\nThe primary trauma was the actual \"parting\" from the parents, and the age of the Kinder at the time. How this parting was \"explained\" was very important, for example, \"you are going on an exciting adventure,\" or \"you are going on a short trip and we will see you soon.\"  Except that, for younger children, perhaps six and younger, they generally would not accept such an explanation and would demand to stay with their parents. There are many records of tears and screaming at the various train-stations where the actual parting took place. Even for older, \"more willing to accept the parents' \"explanation,\" at some point that child realised that he or she would be separated from his or her parents for a long and indefinite time. The younger Kinder had no developed sense of time, and for them the trauma of separation was total from the very beginning.\n\nHaving to learn a new language in a situation where the German or Czech native language was not understood was a stressor. To have to learn to live with strangers, who only spoke English, and accept them as \"pseudo-parents\" was a trauma. At school, the English children would often view the Kinder as \"enemy Germans\" instead of as \"Jewish refugees\".\n\nBefore WWII's start on Sept 1, 1939, and even during the first part of the war, some parents were able to escape from Hitler and reach England and then reunite with their children. But this was the exception; most of the parents were murdered by the Nazis.\n \nThe older ones became fully aware of the war in Europe during 1939-1945 and its actual details, and they would understand and become concerned for their parents. During the later part of the war, they may have become aware of the [[Holocaust]] and the actual direct threat to their Jewish parents and extended family. At the end of WWII in 1945, nearly all the Kinder would sooner or later learn that their parents had been murdered. <ref>[[Dawidowicz, Lucy|Lucy Dawidowicz]] (1986), ''The War Against the Jews.''

She went to Vienna with the purpose of negotiating with [[Adolf Eichmann]] directly, but was initially turned away. She persevered however, until finally, as she wrote in her biography, Eichmann suddenly \"gave\" her 600 children with the clear intent of overloading her and making a transport on such short notice impossible.

They were run on communal lines. About 120 of the Kindertransport children grew up during the war years at these hostels at Exmouth, Dawlish, and South Devon. Bnei Akiva ran a number of hostels including at Gwrych Castle in North Wales, Bromsgrove and Farnham. The hostels themselves were large family mansions that were made available by their owners and helped by both the British government and the Jewish social and charitable organizations.

In order to assure the children follow Jewish dietary laws (Kosher) he instructed them to say to the foster parents that they are fish eating vegetarians. He also saved large numbers of Jews with South American protection papers. He brought over to England several thousand young people, rabbis, teachers, ritual slaughterers and other religious functionaries.<ref>See the entry [[Solomon Schonfeld]], and the book ''Holocaust Hero: Solomon Schonfeld'', by Dr. Kranzler (Ktav Publishing House, New Jersey, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Internment and war service==\nIn 1940, the British government ordered the internment of all male 16- to 70-year-old refugees from enemy countries&nbsp;\u2013 so-called ''friendly [[enemy aliens]]''. Many of the children who had arrived in earlier years were now young men, and so they were also interned. Approximately 1,000 of these ''prior-kinder'' were interned in these makeshift [[List of concentration and internment camps|internment camps]], many on the [[Isle of Man]]. Around 400 were transported overseas to Canada and Australia (see [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']]).\n\nAs the camp internees reached the age of 18, they were offered the chance to do war work or to enter the Army Auxiliary [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]]. About 1,000 German and Austrian ''prior-kinder'' who reached adulthood went on to serve in the British armed forces, including in combat units. Several dozen joined elite formations such as the [[Special forces#Britain|Special Forces]], where their language skills were put to good use during the [[D-Day Invasion]] and afterwards as the Allies progressed into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].\n\nThe British internment period for ''friendly enemy aliens'' generally lasted only a few months, until they were processed by the government and released.\n\n==\"American Kindertransport\"==\n{{main|One Thousand Children}}\nThe One Thousand Children (OTC) was a similar but much less organised effort to transport unaccompanied children, mostly Jewish, to the United States. The programme brought about 1,400 children aged between 14 months and 16 years to the United States between November 1934 and May 1945. Like the ''kinder'', these OTC children were forced to leave their parents behind in Europe; many of them were later murdered by the Nazis.\n\nIn contrast to the Kindertransport, where the British Government waived immigration visa requirements, these OTC children received no United States Government visa immigration assistance. Furthermore, it is documented that the State Department deliberately made it very difficult for any Jewish refugee to get an entrance visa.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941\u20131945]] |last= Wyman |first= David S. | authorlink= David Wyman |edition= |origyear= |year= 1984 |publisher= [[Pantheon Books]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-394-42813-7 |pages= 124\u2013142 }}</ref> And it was even harder to secure the appropriate papers for their parents, hence most had to remain in Europe.\n\nIn 1939 Sen.

The train, consisting of an original locomotive and carriages used in the 1930s, headed to London via the original ''Kindertransport'' route. On board the train were several surviving ''Winton children'' and their descendants, who were to be welcomed by the now hundred-year-old Sir [[Nicholas Winton]] in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the intended last Kindertransport, which was due to set off on 3 September 1939 but did not because of the outbreak of the Second World War. At the train's departure, Sir Nicholas Winton's statue was unveiled at the railway station.<ref>{{cite web|last=\u010cTK |title=Train in honour of Jewish children rescuer Winton leaves Prague |url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/train-in-honour-of-jewish-children-rescuer-winton-leaves-prague/395346 |date=1 September 2009 |work=\u010cesk\u00e9 noviny |publisher=Neris s.r.o. |accessdate=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904103942/http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/train-in-honour-of-jewish-children-rescuer-winton-leaves-prague/395346 |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Academic debate ==\nJessica Reinisch notes how the British media and politicians alike allude to the Kindertransport in contemporary debates on refugee and migration crises. She argues that \"the Kindertransport\" is used as evidence of Britain's \"proud tradition\" of taking in refugees; but that such allusions are problematic as the Kinderstransport model is taken out of context and thus subject to [[nostalgia]]. She points out that countries such as Britain and the United States did much to prevent immigration by turning desperate people away; at the [[\u00c9vian Conference]] in 1938, participant nations failed to reach agreement about accepting Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-matters-but-which-one-every-refugee-crisis-has-a-context|title=History matters\u2026 but which one?
