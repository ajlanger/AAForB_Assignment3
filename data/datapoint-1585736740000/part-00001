Maslow's thesis was published as two articles in 1934.\n\n===Academic career===\nHe continued his research at [[Columbia University]] on similar themes. There he found another mentor in [[Alfred Adler]], one of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s early colleagues. From 1937 to 1951, Maslow was on the faculty of [[Brooklyn College]]. His family life and his experiences influenced his psychological ideas. After [[World War II]], Maslow began to question the way psychologists had come to their conclusions, and although he did not completely disagree, he had his own ideas on how to understand the human mind.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 42.</ref> He called his new discipline [[humanistic psychology]]. Maslow was already a 33-year-old father and had two children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. He was thus ineligible for the military. However, the horrors of war inspired a vision of peace in him leading to his groundbreaking psychological studies of self-actualizing. The studies began under the supervision of two mentors, [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Max Wertheimer]], whom he admired both professionally and personally. They accomplished a lot in both realms. Being such \"wonderful human beings\" as well, they inspired Maslow to take notes about them and their behavior. This would be the basis of his lifelong research and thinking about [[mental health]] and [[human potential]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Abraham Maslow: a biographer's reflections |author=Edward Hoffman |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=439\u2013443 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320534}}</ref> He extended the subject, borrowing ideas from other psychologists and adding new ones, such as the concepts of a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]], [[Metamotivation|metaneeds]], [[metamotivation]], [[Self-actualization|self-actualizing]] persons, and [[peak experiences]]. Maslow was a professor at [[Brandeis University]] from 1951 to 1969. He became a resident fellow of the Laughlin Institute in California. In 1967, Maslow had a serious heart attack and knew his time was limited. He considered himself to be a psychological pioneer. He gave future psychologists a push by bringing to light different paths to ponder.<ref>Thoreau, H. (1962). Thoreau: Walden and other writings. New York: Bantam Books. (Original work published 1854)</ref> He built the framework that later allowed other psychologists to conduct more comprehensive studies. Maslow believed that leadership should be non-intervening. Consistent with this approach, he rejected a nomination in 1963 to be the president of the Association for [[Humanistic Psychology]] because he felt that the organization should develop an intellectual movement without a leader.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miles Vich |year=2008 |title=Maslow's leadership legacy |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=444\u2013445 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320540}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile jogging, Maslow suffered a severe [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died on June 8, 1970, at the age of 62 in [[Menlo Park, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/maslow.htm|title=Psychology History|work=muskingum.edu|accessdate=2015-12-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220204237/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/maslow.htm|archivedate=2015-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Dr. Abraham Maslow, Founder Of Humanistic Psychology, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/10/archives/dr-abraham-maslow-founder-of-humanistic-psychology-dies.html |quote=Dr. Abraham Maslow, professor of psychology at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., and founder of what has come to be known as humanistic psychology, died of a heart attack.

Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. [[Humanistic psychology]] gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was [[client-centered therapy]] developed by [[Carl Rogers]].\n\nThe basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple:\n\n# Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future.\n# To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative.\n# Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person.\n# The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\">{{cite web|title=Humanistic Psychology |url=http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |accessdate=21 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824115841/http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |archivedate=24 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHumanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined ''positive psychology'', is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\"/> [[Humanistic psychologist]]s believe that every person has a strong desire to realize their full potential, to reach a level of \"[[self-actualization]]\". The main point of that new movement, that reached its peak in 1960s, was to emphasize the positive potential of human beings.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L. \"Psychology\"</ref> Maslow positioned his work as a vital complement to that of Freud:\n{{quote|It is as if Freud supplied us the sick half of psychology and we must now fill it out with the healthy half.<ref>Toward a psychology of being, 1968</ref>}}\nHowever, Maslow was highly critical of Freud, since humanistic psychologists did not recognize spirituality as a navigation for our behaviours.<ref>The Personal Meaning of Social Values in the Work of Abraham Maslow\nby John H. Morgan\nInterpersona : An International Journal on Personal Relationships, ISSN 1981-6472, 06/2012, Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 75 - 93</ref>\n\nTo prove that humans are not blindly reacting to situations, but trying to accomplish something greater, Maslow studied mentally healthy individuals instead of people with serious psychological issues. He focused on self-actualizing people. Self-actualizing people indicate a ''coherent personality syndrome'' and represent optimal psychological health and functioning.<ref>Michael Daniels, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02684455 \"The Development of the Concept of Selfactualization in the writings of Abraham Maslow\"], \"University of Toronto Libraries\" {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThis informed his theory that a person enjoys \"[[peak experience]]s\", high points in life when the individual is in harmony with himself and his surroundings. In Maslow's view, self-actualized people can have many peak experiences throughout a day while others have those experiences less frequently.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 43.</ref> He believed that psychedelic drugs like [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[Psilocybin]] can produce peak experiences in the right people under the right circumstances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Peak and plateau experiences===\nBeyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[Peak experiences]], which are profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient and yet a part of the world, more aware of truth, justice, harmony, goodness, and so on. Self-actualizing people are more likely to have peak experiences. In other words, these \"peak experiences\" or states of flow are the reflections of the realization of one's human potential and represent the height of personality development.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|page=487}}</ref>\n\nIn later writings Maslow moved to a more inclusive model that allowed for, in addition to intense peak experiences, longer-lasting periods of serene Being-cognition that he termed [[Peak experience#Plateau experience|''plateau experiences'']].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krippner | first1 = Stanley | year = 1972 | title = The plateau experience: A.

None of his published works included a visual representation of the hierarchy. The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow's needs theory and may give the impression that the Hierarchy of Needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid\u2014with many needs being present in a person simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Maslow | first1 = A.

Late in life, Maslow came to conclude that self-actualization was not an automatic outcome of satisfying the other human needs <ref>Frick, W. B. (1989). Interview with Dr. Abraham Maslow.

These two steps are important to the physical survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.\n* The third level of need is \"Love and Belonging\", which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.\n* The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the \"Esteem\" level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.\n* Then there is the \"Cognitive\" level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.\n* After that is the \"Aesthetic\" level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.<ref>Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour \u2013 4th Canadian ed. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.</ref>\n* At the top of the pyramid, \"Need for Self-actualization\" occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential.<ref>The Developing Person through the Life Span, (1983) pg. 44</ref> Once a person has reached the self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nThe first four levels are known as ''Deficit needs'' or ''D-needs''. This means that if you do not have enough of one of those four needs, you will have the feeling that you need to get it. But when you do get them, then you feel content. These needs alone are not motivating.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nMaslow wrote that there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied. For example, freedom of speech, freedom to express oneself, and freedom to seek new information<ref>A Theory of Human Motivation</ref> are a few of the prerequisites. Any blockages of these freedoms could prevent the satisfaction of the basic needs.\n\nMaslow's Hierarchy is used in higher education for advising students and student retention<ref>Brookman, David M. \"Maslow's Hierarchy and Student Retention\".

These self-actualized individuals were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual development on \"potentialities and inner resources\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richard L.

R. (19992000). Memory. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 461). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.</ref> Consequently, Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together, these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he  establishes meaningful connections to an external reality\u2014an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships\u2014his awareness remains internal and limited.\n\n===Metamotivation===\nMaslow used the term [[metamotivation]] to describe self-actualized people who are driven by innate forces beyond their basic needs, so that they may explore and reach their full human potential.<ref>[[#Goble|Goble (1970)]]</ref>\n\n===Methodology===\nMaslow based his study on the writings of other psychologists, [[Albert Einstein]] and people he knew who [he felt] clearly met the standard of self-actualization.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

But [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Max Wertheimer]] were also Maslow's models of self-actualization.  In this case, from a scientific perspective there are numerous problems with this particular approach.  First, it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher.  Personal opinion is always prone to bias, which reduces the validity of any data obtained.  Therefore, Maslow's operational definition of Self-actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

Maslow had concluded that humanistic psychology was incapable of explaining all aspects of human experience. He identified various mystical, ecstatic, or spiritual states known as \"[[peak experiences]]\" as experiences beyond self-actualization. Maslow called these experiences \"a fourth force in psychology\", which he named transpersonal psychology. Transpersonal psychology was concerned with the \"empirical, scientific study of, and responsible implementation of the finding relevant to, becoming, mystical, ecstatic, and spiritual states\" (Olson & Hergenhahn, 2011).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMaslow published in 1962 a collection of papers on this theme, which developed into his 1968 book ''Toward a Psychology of Being''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=Matthew H.

In this book Maslow proposed a model of \u2018characterologically relative\u2019 science, which he characterized as an ardent opposition to the \u2018\u2018historically, philosophically, sociologically and psychologically na\u0131ve\u2019\u2019 positivistic reluctance to see science \u2018\u2018relative to time, place, and local culture\u2019\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Science: A Reconnaissance|last=Maslow|first=Abraham|publisher=Gateway Editions|year=1969|isbn=|location=South Bend, Indiana|pages=1|via=}}</ref> As Maslow acknowledged, the book was greatly inspired by Thomas Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962), and it offers a psychological reading of Kuhn's famous distinction between \"normal\" and \"revolutionary\" science in the context of his own distinction between \"safety\" and \"growth\" science, put forward as part of a larger program for the psychology of science, outlined already in his 1954 ''magnum opus'' ''Motivation and Personality''. Not only that Maslow offered a psychological reading of Kuhn's categories of \"normal\" and \"revolutionary\" science as an aftermath of Kuhn's ''Structure'', but he also offered a strikingly similar dichotomous structure of science 16 years before the first edition of ''Structure'', in his nowadays little known 1946 paper \"Means-Centering Versus Problem-Centering in Science\" published in the journal ''Philosophy of Science''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ko\u017enjak|first=Boris|date=2017|title=Kuhn Meets Maslow: The Psychology Behind Scientific Revolutions|journal=Journal for General Philosophy of Science|volume=48|issue=2|pages=257\u2013287|doi=10.1007/s10838-016-9352-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=Abraham|date=1946|title=Problem-centering vs. means-centering in science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=326\u2013331 |doi=10.1086/286907|jstor=185213}}</ref>\n\n===Maslow's hammer===\nAbraham Maslow is also known for [[Maslow's hammer]], popularly phrased as \"[[wikt:if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail|if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail]]\"  from his book ''The Psychology of Science'', published in 1966.<ref name=maslow66>\n{{cite book\n | title = The Psychology of Science\n | author = Abraham H.

In particular, while they found&mdash;clearly in accordance with Maslow&mdash;that people tend to achieve basic and safety needs before other needs, as well as that other \"higher needs\" tend to be fulfilled in a certain order, the order in which they are fulfilled apparently does not strongly influence their subjective well-being (SWB).

Maslow's thesis was published as two articles in 1934.\n\n===Academic career===\nHe continued his research at [[Columbia University]] on similar themes. There he found another mentor in [[Alfred Adler]], one of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s early colleagues. From 1937 to 1951, Maslow was on the faculty of [[Brooklyn College]]. His family life and his experiences influenced his psychological ideas. After [[World War II]], Maslow began to question the way psychologists had come to their conclusions, and although he did not completely disagree, he had his own ideas on how to understand the human mind.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 42.</ref> He called his new discipline [[humanistic psychology]]. Maslow was already a 33-year-old father and had two children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. He was thus ineligible for the military. However, the horrors of war inspired a vision of peace in him leading to his groundbreaking psychological studies of self-actualizing. The studies began under the supervision of two mentors, [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Max Wertheimer]], whom he admired both professionally and personally. They accomplished a lot in both realms. Being such \"wonderful human beings\" as well, they inspired Maslow to take notes about them and their behavior. This would be the basis of his lifelong research and thinking about [[mental health]] and [[human potential]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Abraham Maslow: a biographer's reflections |author=Edward Hoffman |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=439\u2013443 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320534}}</ref> He extended the subject, borrowing ideas from other psychologists and adding new ones, such as the concepts of a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]], [[Metamotivation|metaneeds]], [[metamotivation]], [[Self-actualization|self-actualizing]] persons, and [[peak experiences]]. Maslow was a professor at [[Brandeis University]] from 1951 to 1969. He became a resident fellow of the Laughlin Institute in California. In 1967, Maslow had a serious heart attack and knew his time was limited. He considered himself to be a psychological pioneer. He gave future psychologists a push by bringing to light different paths to ponder.<ref>Thoreau, H. (1962). Thoreau: Walden and other writings. New York: Bantam Books. (Original work published 1854)</ref> He built the framework that later allowed other psychologists to conduct more comprehensive studies. Maslow believed that leadership should be non-intervening. Consistent with this approach, he rejected a nomination in 1963 to be the president of the Association for [[Humanistic Psychology]] because he felt that the organization should develop an intellectual movement without a leader.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miles Vich |year=2008 |title=Maslow's leadership legacy |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=444\u2013445 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320540}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile jogging, Maslow suffered a severe [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died on June 8, 1970, at the age of 62 in [[Menlo Park, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/maslow.htm|title=Psychology History|work=muskingum.edu|accessdate=2015-12-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220204237/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/maslow.htm|archivedate=2015-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Dr. Abraham Maslow, Founder Of Humanistic Psychology, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/10/archives/dr-abraham-maslow-founder-of-humanistic-psychology-dies.html |quote=Dr. Abraham Maslow, professor of psychology at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., and founder of what has come to be known as humanistic psychology, died of a heart attack.

Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. [[Humanistic psychology]] gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was [[client-centered therapy]] developed by [[Carl Rogers]].\n\nThe basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple:\n\n# Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future.\n# To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative.\n# Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person.\n# The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\">{{cite web|title=Humanistic Psychology |url=http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |accessdate=21 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824115841/http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |archivedate=24 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHumanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined ''positive psychology'', is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\"/> [[Humanistic psychologist]]s believe that every person has a strong desire to realize their full potential, to reach a level of \"[[self-actualization]]\". The main point of that new movement, that reached its peak in 1960s, was to emphasize the positive potential of human beings.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L. \"Psychology\"</ref> Maslow positioned his work as a vital complement to that of Freud:\n{{quote|It is as if Freud supplied us the sick half of psychology and we must now fill it out with the healthy half.<ref>Toward a psychology of being, 1968</ref>}}\nHowever, Maslow was highly critical of Freud, since humanistic psychologists did not recognize spirituality as a navigation for our behaviours.<ref>The Personal Meaning of Social Values in the Work of Abraham Maslow\nby John H. Morgan\nInterpersona : An International Journal on Personal Relationships, ISSN 1981-6472, 06/2012, Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 75 - 93</ref>\n\nTo prove that humans are not blindly reacting to situations, but trying to accomplish something greater, Maslow studied mentally healthy individuals instead of people with serious psychological issues. He focused on self-actualizing people. Self-actualizing people indicate a ''coherent personality syndrome'' and represent optimal psychological health and functioning.<ref>Michael Daniels, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02684455 \"The Development of the Concept of Selfactualization in the writings of Abraham Maslow\"], \"University of Toronto Libraries\" {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThis informed his theory that a person enjoys \"[[peak experience]]s\", high points in life when the individual is in harmony with himself and his surroundings. In Maslow's view, self-actualized people can have many peak experiences throughout a day while others have those experiences less frequently.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 43.</ref> He believed that psychedelic drugs like [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[Psilocybin]] can produce peak experiences in the right people under the right circumstances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Peak and plateau experiences===\nBeyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[Peak experiences]], which are profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient and yet a part of the world, more aware of truth, justice, harmony, goodness, and so on. Self-actualizing people are more likely to have peak experiences. In other words, these \"peak experiences\" or states of flow are the reflections of the realization of one's human potential and represent the height of personality development.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|page=487}}</ref>\n\nIn later writings Maslow moved to a more inclusive model that allowed for, in addition to intense peak experiences, longer-lasting periods of serene Being-cognition that he termed [[Peak experience#Plateau experience|''plateau experiences'']].<ref>Krippner, Stanley (1972). \n[https://www.academia.edu/27103672 The plateau experience: A.

None of his published works included a visual representation of the hierarchy. The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow's needs theory and may give the impression that the Hierarchy of Needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid\u2014with many needs being present in a person simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Maslow | first1 = A.

Late in life, Maslow came to conclude that self-actualization was not an automatic outcome of satisfying the other human needs <ref>Frick, W. B. (1989). Interview with Dr. Abraham Maslow.

These two steps are important to the physical survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.\n* The third level of need is \"Love and Belonging\", which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.\n* The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the \"Esteem\" level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.\n* Then there is the \"Cognitive\" level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.\n* After that is the \"Aesthetic\" level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.<ref>Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour \u2013 4th Canadian ed. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.</ref>\n* At the top of the pyramid, \"Need for Self-actualization\" occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential.<ref>The Developing Person through the Life Span, (1983) pg. 44</ref> Once a person has reached the self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nThe first four levels are known as ''Deficit needs'' or ''D-needs''. This means that if you do not have enough of one of those four needs, you will have the feeling that you need to get it. But when you do get them, then you feel content. These needs alone are not motivating.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nMaslow wrote that there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied.

These self-actualized individuals were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual development on \"potentialities and inner resources\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richard L.

R. (19992000). Memory. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 461). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.</ref> Consequently, Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together, these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he  establishes meaningful connections to an external reality\u2014an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships\u2014his awareness remains internal and limited.\n\n===Metamotivation===\nMaslow used the term [[metamotivation]] to describe self-actualized people who are driven by innate forces beyond their basic needs, so that they may explore and reach their full human potential.<ref>[[#Goble|Goble (1970)]]</ref>\n\n===Methodology===\nMaslow based his study on the writings of other psychologists, [[Albert Einstein]] and people he knew who [he felt] clearly met the standard of self-actualization.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

But [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Max Wertheimer]] were also Maslow's models of self-actualization.  In this case, from a scientific perspective there are numerous problems with this particular approach.  First, it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher.  Personal opinion is always prone to bias, which reduces the validity of any data obtained.  Therefore, Maslow's operational definition of Self-actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

Maslow had concluded that humanistic psychology was incapable of explaining all aspects of human experience. He identified various mystical, ecstatic, or spiritual states known as \"[[peak experiences]]\" as experiences beyond self-actualization. Maslow called these experiences \"a fourth force in psychology\", which he named transpersonal psychology. Transpersonal psychology was concerned with the \"empirical, scientific study of, and responsible implementation of the finding relevant to, becoming, mystical, ecstatic, and spiritual states\" (Olson & Hergenhahn, 2011).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMaslow published in 1962 a collection of papers on this theme, which developed into his 1968 book ''Toward a Psychology of Being''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=Matthew H.

Not only that Maslow offered a psychological reading of Kuhn's categories of \"normal\" and \"revolutionary\" science as an aftermath of Kuhn's ''Structure'', but he also offered a strikingly similar dichotomous structure of science 16 years before the first edition of ''Structure'', in his nowadays little known 1946 paper \"Means-Centering Versus Problem-Centering in Science\" published in the journal ''Philosophy of Science''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ko\u017enjak|first=Boris|date=2017|title=Kuhn Meets Maslow: The Psychology Behind Scientific Revolutions|journal=Journal for General Philosophy of Science|volume=48|issue=2|pages=257\u2013287|doi=10.1007/s10838-016-9352-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=Abraham|date=1946|title=Problem-centering vs. means-centering in science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=326\u2013331 |doi=10.1086/286907|jstor=185213}}</ref>\n\n===Maslow's hammer===\nAbraham Maslow is also known for [[Maslow's hammer]], popularly phrased as \"[[wikt:if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail|if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail]]\"  from his book ''The Psychology of Science'', published in 1966.<ref name=maslow66>\n{{cite book\n | title = The Psychology of Science\n | author = Abraham H.

In particular, while they found&mdash;clearly in accordance with Maslow&mdash;that people tend to achieve basic and safety needs before other needs, as well as that other \"higher needs\" tend to be fulfilled in a certain order, the order in which they are fulfilled apparently does not strongly influence their subjective well-being (SWB).
