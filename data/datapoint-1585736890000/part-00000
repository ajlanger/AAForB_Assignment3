Australian Aboriginal English is spoken among Aboriginal people generally, but is especially evident in what are called \"discrete communities\", i.e. ex-government or mission reserves such as the [[Deed of Grant in Trust|DOGIT communities]] in Queensland.

The distinction between ''he'' as the [[nominative]] form and ''him'' as the oblique form is not always observed, and ''him'' may be found as the subject of a verb.\n\n===\"Fellow\"===\nIn some forms of Aboriginal English, ''fellow'' (also spelt ''fella'', ''feller'', ''fullah'', ''fulla'', ''balla'' etc.) is used in combination with adjectives or numerals, e.g. ''big fella business'' = \"important business\", ''one-feller girl'' = \"one girl\". This can give it an adverbial meaning, e.g. ''sing out big fella'' = \"call out loudly\". It is also used with pronouns to indicate the plural, e.g. ''me fella'' = \"we\" or \"us\", ''you fella'' = \"you all\".\n\n==Lexicon==\n===''Balanda''===\n''[[List of English words of Malay origin#B|Balanda]]'' is a word used by the [[Yol\u014bu]] people for European people; originally from the [[Makassar]] language, via the [[Malay language|Malay]] \"orang belanda\" ([[Dutch person]]).<ref name=\"walkerzorc1981\">{{cite journal |author1= Walker, Alan |author2=Zorc, R.

Funeral and mourning practices are commonly known as ''Sorry Business''. Financial matters are referred to as ''Money Business'', and the secret-sacred rituals distinct to each sex are referred to as ''Women's Business'' and ''Men's Business''. \"Secret women's business\" was at the centre of the [[Hindmarsh Island Bridge]] controversy.\n\n===Camp===\nMany Aboriginal people refer to their house as their camp, particularly in [[Central Australia]] and the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]].\n\n===Cheeky===\n\"Cheeky\" may be used to describe a dog or other animal that's likely to bite or attack.\n\n===Dardy===\nDardy, meaning \"cool\", is used amongst South West Australian Aboriginal peoples. This word has also been adopted by non-Indigenous Australian teens, particularly in the skateboarding subculture. Many Australian teens also use the word to describe something worth buying.\n\n===Deadly===\nDeadly is used by many Aboriginal people to mean excellent, or very good, in the same way that ''wicked'' is by many young English speakers. [[Deadly Awards|The Deadlys]] were awards for outstanding achievement by Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islander people]].  \n\nThis usage is not exclusive to Aboriginal people.  It is commonly heard in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Gammon===\n[[Victorian era]] English word for ''pretend''. Still used by some Australian Aboriginal people to mean joking generally. Gammoning \u2013 usually pronounced ''Gam'in'''. This word is widely used across the Northern Territory of Australia by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and is now gaining usage elsewhere in Australia.\n\nAustralian language expert, Sidney J. Baker, lists \"gammon\" used by \"whitefellas\" as \"falsehood\".\n\n===''Gubbah''===\n''Gubbah'' is a term used by some Aboriginal people to refer to white people. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' has it as \"''n. Colloq. (derog.)'' an Aboriginal term for a white man.\" Also, \"''gubba, n. Colloq. (derog.)'' 1. a white man. 2. a peeping tom. [Aboriginal: white demon].\" It is also said to be a shortening of the word \"government man\", which is itself 19th-century slang for \"convict\". Another theory is that it is a contraction of \"Governor\". It has also been suggested the word is the \"diminutive of garbage\".<ref>Wilkes, G.A. ''A Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms'' (Sydney: Fontana/Collins, 1978, p. 167</ref> It is often used pejoratively and even considered unreasonably rude within urban Aboriginal circles.\n\n===Humbug===\nWhereas [[humbug]] in broader English (see [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] character) means nonsensical, or unimportant information, humbug in Aboriginal English means to pester with inane or repetitive requests. The [[Warumpi Band]]'s most recent album is entitled ''Too Much Humbug''. In the [[Northern Territory]], humbug is used by both black and white in this latter, Aboriginal way.\nThe most commonly recognised definition of [[humbug]], refers to an Aboriginal person asking a relative for money. Humbugging can become a serious burden where the traditional culture is one of communal ownership and strong obligations between relatives.\n\n===Mob===\nColloquially used to mean a group of Aboriginal people associated with an extended family group, clan group or wider community group, from a particular place or country. It is used to connect and identify the person and where they are from.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadlystory.com/page/tools/aboriginal-cultural-support-planning/cultural-planning---frequently-asked-questions/what-is-the-difference-between-mob-clan-tribe-language-group|title=What is the difference between mob, clan, tribe, language group?|website=Deadly Story|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref> \"My mob\" means my people, or extended family.\n\nMob is often used to refer to a [[Australian Aboriginal languages|language group]], as in ''that [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] mob''.\n\nThe term is also found in the name of [[hip-hop]] group, [[The Wilcannia Mob]], from the town of [[Wilcannia]] in [[New South Wales]] .\n\n=== Rubbish===\nWhile \"rubbish\" as an adjective in many dialects of English means wrong, stupid, or useless, in the north of Australia, \"rubbish\" is usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is \"not dangerous\"; for example, non-venomous snakes are all considered to be \"rubbish\", while in contrast, venomous snakes are \"cheeky\". In both cases, \"rubbish\" approximately means \"inert\".\n\n===Yarn===\nEnglish word for a [[shaggy dog story|long story]], often with incredible or unbelievable events. Originally a sailors' expression, \"to spin a yarn\", in reference to stories told while performing mundane tasks such as spinning [[yarn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=yarn|title=Online etymology dictionary}}</ref> In [[Australian English]], and particularly among Aboriginal people, has become a verb, to talk. Often, ''Yarnin''.\n\n===Unna===\nOften conjoined with the word \"deadly\", \"unna\" means \"ain't it?\" This word is used frequently in the 1998 novel ''[[Deadly, Unna?]]'' by [[Phillip Gwynne]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice|section}}\nSutton (1989) documents that some speakers of Aboriginal English in the area around [[Adelaide]] have an uncommon degree of [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]], relative to both other AAE speakers and Standard Australian English speakers (which are generally non-rhotic). These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 within [[word stem|stems]]. For example: [bo\u02d0\u0279d] \"board\", [t\u0320\u0283\u025c\u0279t\u0320\u0283] \"church\", [p\u025c\u0279\u03b8] \"Perth\"; but [fl\u00e6\u02d0] \"flour\", [d\u0252kt\u0259] \"doctor\", [j\u026a\u0259z] \"years\". Sutton speculates that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia \u2013 including [[Cornish English|Cornish]] tin-miners, [[Scottish English|Scottish]] missionaries, and [[American English|American]] whalers \u2013 spoke rhotic varieties.
