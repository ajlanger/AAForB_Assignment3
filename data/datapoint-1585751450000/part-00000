In 985, while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400\u2013700 settlers<ref name=\"ROBW\" /><ref name=\"NM2\" /> and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named [[Bjarni Herj\u00f3lfsson]] was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his discovery to [[Leif Erikson]] who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\nThe sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration: [[Helluland]], which means \"land of the flat stones\"; [[Markland]], \"the land of forests\", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and [[Vinland]], \"the land of wine\", found somewhere south of Markland.

In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered [[canoe]]s. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the [[barricade]]. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring.

The sagas first gained serious historic respectability in 1837 when the Danish antiquarian [[Carl Christian Rafn]] pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name [[Winland]], first appeared in written sources in a work by [[Adam of Bremen]] from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. These Norse sites were also depicted in the [[Sk\u00e1lholt#Sk\u00e1lholt map|Sk\u00e1lholt Map]], made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570 and depicting part of northeastern North America and mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ingstad|first1=Helga|last2=Ingstad|first2=Anne Stine|title=The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland|date=2001|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0816047161|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gj-I5hdpzGoC&pg=PA111&dq=Sk%C3%A1lholt+Map+%22north+america%22#v=onepage&q=Sk%C3%A1lholt%20Map%20%22north%20america%22&f=false|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist [[Anne Stine Ingstad]] and her husband, outdoorsman and author [[Helge Ingstad]], excavated a Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]].

In 985, while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400\u2013700 settlers<ref name=\"ROBW\" /><ref name=\"NM2\" /> and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named [[Bjarni Herj\u00f3lfsson]] was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his discovery to [[Leif Erikson]] who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\nThe sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration: [[Helluland]], which means \"land of the flat stones\"; [[Markland]], \"the land of forests\", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and [[Vinland]], \"the land of wine\", found somewhere south of Markland. It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded.\n\n===Leif's winter camp===\n[[File:Sk\u00e1lholt-Karte.png|thumb|The 1590 [[Sk\u00e1lholt Map]] showing Latinized Norse placenames in North America<ref>http://www.myoldmaps.com/renaissance-maps-1490-1800/4316-skalholt-map/4316-skalholt-map.pdf</ref>:\n* Land of the ''[[J\u00f6tunn|Risi]]'' (a [[Norse cosmology|mythical location]])\n* [[Greenland]]\n* [[Helluland]] ([[Baffin Island]])\n* [[Markland]] (the [[Labrador Peninsula]])\n* Land of the ''[[Skr\u00e6lingjar]]'' (location undetermined)\n* Promontory of [[Vinland]] (the [[Great Northern Peninsula]])]]\n\nUsing the routes, landmarks, [[ocean current|currents]], rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed from Greenland westward across the Labrador Sea, with a crew of 35\u2014sailing the same [[knarr]] Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as \"level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline.\"<ref name=\"ROBW\" /> Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it.  However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\nLeif wintered in 1001, probably near [[Cape Bauld]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], where one day his foster father [[Tyrker]] was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \"wine-berries.\" [[Viburnum edule|Squashberries]], [[gooseberries]], and [[Cranberry|cranberries]] all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing [[Fermentation (wine)|fermented berries]] as \"wine.\"\n\nLeif spent another winter at \"Leifsb\u00fa\u00f0ir\" without conflict, and sailed back to [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0]] in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father.\n\n===Thorvald's voyage (1004 AD)===\nIn 1004, Leif's brother [[Thorvald Eiriksson]] sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered [[canoe]]s. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the [[barricade]]. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\n[[File:I. E. C.

The sagas first gained serious historic respectability in 1837 when the Danish antiquarian [[Carl Christian Rafn]] pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name [[Winland]], first appeared in written sources in a work by [[Adam of Bremen]] from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. These Norse sites were also depicted in the [[Sk\u00e1lholt#Sk\u00e1lholt map|Sk\u00e1lholt Map]], made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570 and depicting part of northeastern North America and mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ingstad|first1=Helga|last2=Ingstad|first2=Anne Stine|title=The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland|date=2001|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0816047161|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gj-I5hdpzGoC&pg=PA111&dq=Sk%C3%A1lholt+Map+%22north+america%22#v=onepage&q=Sk%C3%A1lholt%20Map%20%22north%20america%22&f=false|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist [[Anne Stine Ingstad]] and her husband, outdoorsman and author [[Helge Ingstad]], excavated a Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]].
