This [[Foreland basin|foreland system]] was caused by [[Tectonic uplift|crustal uplift]] that had previously begun to take course due to the [[subduction]] of the Palaeo-pacific [[Plate tectonics|plate]] beneath the Gondwanan [[Plate tectonics|plate]]. This resulted in the rise of the Gondwanide mountain range in what is known as the [[Gondwanide orogeny]]. The continuation of the [[Orogeny|orogenic]] pulses from the growing Gondwanides mountain chain and associated [[subduction]] created accommodation space for sedimentation in the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]] which ran along an east to west trending foreland trough. The formation of the Karoo Basin resulted in the preservation of the Dwyka Group rocks and all succeeding rocks that make up the greater [[Karoo Supergroup]]. [[Southern Africa]] at this time was part of the [[supercontinent]], [[Gondwana]], and was positioned over the [[Antarctic Circle|antarctic circle]] at this time. The result was the development of the [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial environment where massive [[ice sheet]]s entombed the early Karoo Basin in the surrounding highlands and permanent, floating [[glacier]]s in the lowlands.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1993-01-01|title=The tectonic evolution of southern Africa: an overview|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences (and the Middle East)|language=en|volume=16|issue=1\u20132|pages=5\u201324|doi=10.1016/0899-5362(93)90159-N|issn=0899-5362|last1=Thomas|first1=R.J.|last2=von Veh|first2=M.W.|last3=McCourt|first3=S.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Catuneanu|first=O.|last2=Hancox|first2=P.J.|last3=Rubidge|first3=B.S.|date=1998-12-01|title=Reciprocal flexural behaviour and contrasting stratigraphies: a new basin development model for the Karoo retroarc foreland system, South Africa|url=http://www.earthdoc.org/publication/publicationdetails/?publication=62697|journal=Basin Research|language=English|volume=10|issue=4|issn=1365-2117}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=O.

In the south outcrops and exposures are known from [[Prince Albert, Western Cape|Prince Albert]], [[Matjiesfontein]], [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg]], [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]], and as far south as [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]]. Western to northern exposures are known from [[Calvinia]], [[Carnarvon, Northern Cape|Carnarvon]], [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], and then from [[Vryheid]] and [[Durban]] in the east.\n\nDwyka Group deposits are also found outside of and north of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]]. These deposits found north of the Karoo Basin are found as the lowermost [[geological formation]] of the Springbok Flats, Tshipise, northern Lebombo, Tuli, and [[Ellisras Basin|Ellisras]] ([[Lephalale]]) Basins of north-northeastern [[South Africa]].\n\nIn its southern, western, and eastern deposits, the Dwyka Group conformably overlies rocks of the [[Cape Supergroup]], which includes the [[Cape Fold Belt]], and the Natal Supergroup. It also unconformably overlies the Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Province in some localities in the west-northwest of [[South Africa]]. Its north and northeastern [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]] deposits and all deposits found north of the Karoo Basin [[Unconformity|unconformably]] overlie the [[Transvaal Supergroup]], Ventersdorp Group, or [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] basement rocks. In all South African localities, the Dwyka Group underlies rocks of the [[Ecca Group]].\n\n[[File:Fish River Canyon - Dwyka Riples.jpg|340px|right|Caption: Ripples in Dwyka Group till deposits]] \nThe geographical range of the Dwyka Group is large with its deposits also being found in other localities in [[southern Africa]].

In the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]], the Dwyka Group is known by two distinctive [[Lithology|lithological]] [[facies]]. These two [[facies]] are represented in its northern and southern deposits respectively and are recognized as the two [[geological formation]]s below:\n \n* '''Elandsvlei Formation''' is the southern [[facies]] and it is considered to represent the earliest [[Foreland basin|foredeep]] deposits of the Karoo foreland system. This portion is restricted to the southern areas of South Africa and is characterized by uniform, high, massive, and [[Clastic rock|clast]]-poor [[diamictite]]s and rarer [[mudrock]] deposits. The [[diamictite]]s are highly compacted and overlie stratified diamictites and mudrocks. The southern facies is interpreted as suspension or melt-out deposits that were deposited in low energy [[Subglacial lake|subglacial]] or subaqueous rain-out from either semi-grounded or floating [[ice sheet]]s. All sedimentation occurred below the water surface in a deep [[Ocean|marine]] environment. More evidence to support this is that [[turbidite]]s are often found in Elandsvlei Formation deposits.<ref>Theron, J.N. and Blignault, H.J., 1975.

This portion of the formation is restricted to the northern and northeastern sections of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]]. It is composed of thinly bedded [[mudstone]]s and claystones, stratified [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[Pebble|pebbly]] [[sandstone]]s, and [[diamictite]]s. The [[diamictite]]s in this formation differ here in being very [[Clastic rock|clast]]-rich with very few massive diamictites found. The [[Clastic rock|clasts]] were sourced from [[Erosion|eroded]] material from the much older basement rocks and comprise numerous different rock types. These include [[Quartzite|quarzites]], [[Quartz|vein quartz]], [[Ironstone|banded ironstone]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], [[gneiss]], [[granite]], and [[Amygdule|amygdaloidal lavas]]. It is currently accepted that the northern [[facies]] represents valley-fill deposits, [[Proglacial lake|proglacial]] [[outwash fan]]s, and [[Subglacial lake|subglacial]] [[till]] deposits left by [[Ice sheet|continental glaciers]] retreating towards the south of the early [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]].

This [[Foreland basin|foreland system]] was caused by [[Tectonic uplift|crustal uplift]] that had previously begun to take course due to the [[subduction]] of the Palaeo-pacific [[Plate tectonics|plate]] beneath the Gondwanan [[Plate tectonics|plate]]. This resulted in the rise of the Gondwanide mountain range in what is known as the [[Gondwanide orogeny]]. The continuation of the [[Orogeny|orogenic]] pulses from the growing Gondwanides mountain chain and associated [[subduction]] created accommodation space for sedimentation in the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]] which ran along an east to west trending foreland trough. The formation of the Karoo Basin resulted in the preservation of the Dwyka Group rocks and all succeeding rocks that make up the greater [[Karoo Supergroup]]. [[Southern Africa]] at this time was part of the [[supercontinent]], [[Gondwana]], and was positioned over the [[Antarctic Circle|antarctic circle]] at this time. The result was the development of the [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial environment where massive [[ice sheet]]s entombed the early Karoo Basin in the surrounding highlands and permanent, floating [[glacier]]s in the lowlands.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1993-01-01|title=The tectonic evolution of southern Africa: an overview|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences (and the Middle East)|language=en|volume=16|issue=1\u20132|pages=5\u201324|doi=10.1016/0899-5362(93)90159-N|issn=0899-5362|last1=Thomas|first1=R.J.|last2=von Veh|first2=M.W.|last3=McCourt|first3=S.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Catuneanu|first=O.|last2=Hancox|first2=P.J.|last3=Rubidge|first3=B.S.|date=1998-12-01|title=Reciprocal flexural behaviour and contrasting stratigraphies: a new basin development model for the Karoo retroarc foreland system, South Africa|url=http://www.earthdoc.org/publication/publicationdetails/?publication=62697|journal=Basin Research|language=English|volume=10|issue=4|issn=1365-2117}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=O.

In the south outcrops and exposures are known from [[Prince Albert, Western Cape|Prince Albert]], [[Matjiesfontein]], [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg]], [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]], and as far south as [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]]. Western to northern exposures are known from [[Calvinia]], [[Carnarvon, Northern Cape|Carnarvon]], [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], and then from [[Vryheid]] and [[Durban]] in the east.\n\nDwyka Group deposits are also found outside of and north of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]]. These deposits found north of the Karoo Basin are found as the lowermost [[geological formation]] of the Springbok Flats, Tshipise, northern Lebombo, Tuli, and [[Ellisras Basin|Ellisras]] ([[Lephalale]]) Basins of north-northeastern [[South Africa]].\n\nIn its southern, western, and eastern deposits, the Dwyka Group conformably overlies rocks of the [[Cape Supergroup]], which includes the [[Cape Fold Belt]], and the Natal Supergroup. It also unconformably overlies the Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Province in some localities in the west-northwest of [[South Africa]]. Its north and northeastern [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]] deposits and all deposits found north of the Karoo Basin [[Unconformity|unconformably]] overlie the [[Transvaal Supergroup]], Ventersdorp Group, or [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] basement rocks. In all South African localities, the Dwyka Group underlies rocks of the [[Ecca Group]].\n\n[[File:Fish River Canyon - Dwyka Riples.jpg|340px|right|Caption: Ripples in Dwyka Group till deposits]] \nThe geographical range of the Dwyka Group is large with its deposits also being found in other localities in [[southern Africa]].

In the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]], the Dwyka Group is known by two distinctive [[Lithology|lithological]] [[facies]]. These two [[facies]] are represented in its northern and southern deposits respectively and are recognized as the two [[geological formation]]s below:\n \n* '''Elandsvlei Formation''' is the southern [[facies]] and it is considered to represent the earliest [[Foreland basin|foredeep]] deposits of the Karoo foreland system. This portion is restricted to the southern areas of South Africa and is characterized by uniform, high, massive, and [[Clastic rock|clast]]-poor [[diamictite]]s and rarer [[mudrock]] deposits. The [[diamictite]]s are highly compacted and overlie stratified diamictites and mudrocks. The southern facies is interpreted as suspension or melt-out deposits that were deposited in low energy [[Subglacial lake|subglacial]] or subaqueous rain-out from either semi-grounded or floating [[ice sheet]]s. All sedimentation occurred below the water surface in a deep [[Ocean|marine]] environment. More evidence to support this is that [[turbidite]]s are often found in Elandsvlei Formation deposits.<ref>Theron, J.N. and Blignault, H.J., 1975.

This portion of the formation is restricted to the northern and northeastern sections of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]]. It is composed of thinly bedded [[mudstone]]s and claystones, stratified [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[Pebble|pebbly]] [[sandstone]]s, and [[diamictite]]s. The [[diamictite]]s in this formation differ here in being very [[Clastic rock|clast]]-rich with very few massive diamictites found. The [[Clastic rock|clasts]] were sourced from [[Erosion|eroded]] material from the much older basement rocks and comprise numerous different rock types. These include [[Quartzite|quarzites]], [[Quartz|vein quartz]], [[Ironstone|banded ironstone]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], [[gneiss]], [[granite]], and [[Amygdule|amygdaloidal lavas]]. It is currently accepted that the northern [[facies]] represents valley-fill deposits, [[Proglacial lake|proglacial]] [[outwash fan]]s, and [[Subglacial lake|subglacial]] [[till]] deposits left by [[Ice sheet|continental glaciers]] retreating towards the south of the early [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]]. [[Glacial striation|Glacial pavements]] where striation marks are left on the surface of basement rocks are known from this formation in numerous localities.<ref>Von Brunn, V. and Visser, J.N.J., 1999.
