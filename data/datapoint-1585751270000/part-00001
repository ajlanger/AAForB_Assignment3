Founded in 1913, the town is primarily an agricultural, business, and government administration centre serving communities and rural areas within surrounding [[Westlock County]]. It is located {{convert|90|km}} north to north west of the provincial capital [[Edmonton]].\n\n== Geography ==\nWestlock is located approximately {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], Alberta's provincial capital and Canada's [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|sixth largest]] [[census metropolitan area]].  Westlock sits at the junction of [[Alberta Highway 44|Highway 44]] and [[Alberta Highway 18|Highway 18]]. It is surrounded by Westlock County within [[Division No. 13, Alberta|Census Division 13]].\n\nWestlock lies on the [[Prairie Provinces|Alberta plain]], one of the [[Great Plains]].  It lies just to the north of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] [[river basins]], and to the east of the [[Pembina River (Alberta)|Pembina River]], a tributary of the Athabasca.  The town is about {{convert|670|m}} [[above mean sea level]].  Westlock sits within the [[humid continental climate]] zone, on the northern edge of the [[aspen parkland]] belt, a once heavily treed region that was cleared for agriculture at the turn of the 20th century.  It is a relatively fertile region of dark soils.  To the north lies the [[subarctic climate]] zone.  The mean annual precipitation averaged from one meteorological station within the county measured 468 millimetres (mm), based on data from 1980 to 1990. The mean annual temperature averaged 1.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the\nmean monthly temperature reaching a high of 16.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in July, and dropping to a low of -11.4&nbsp;\u00b0C in January.<ref>http://www.10714.com/pdf/rgwa/westlock.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Westlock was inhabited by [[First Nations]] people, notably the [[Cree]]. Although the [[fur trade]] had been active in Alberta since 1754 when [[Anthony Henday]] explored the area, the Westlock district was not mentioned in writing until [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] came through in April 1799.\n[[File:Edison, Alberta (1906).jpg|thumb|left|Post office in Edison, 1906]]\n\nWhite settlement did not begin until 1902 at that time centred on a [[rural]] community about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of present-day Westlock. The founding family was named Edgson,<ref>{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Daphne|title=Edison, the Way it was : the history of Edison|year=1980|publisher=Co-Op Press|location=Edmonton|page=25|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=249127}}</ref>  but this was considered too hard to pronounce. [[Edson, Alberta]] already existed, so the site was called Edison by its Irish-Canadian founders, after the American inventor [[Thomas Edison]].  The community in 1912 consisted of a total of no more than 13 buildings: a harness shop, a blacksmith shop, several homes, two churches, and one family living in a tent.  There was also a post office but this was closed in 1911 when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] came to power and fired many [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] from [[Canada Post|the postal service]].<ref>http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=display_original&lg=English&fl=0&rd=117752&ex=471</ref>  In 1911 the railway reached nearby [[Clyde, Alberta|Clyde]] to the east, and in 1912 the ''E.D. & B.C. Railway'' (later the [[Northern Alberta Railway]], now part of [[Canadian National|CN]]) mapped a new townsite where Westlock now stands to the west.  Edison was now caught between the two.  In 1914, the [[Methodist]] church building was picked up and moved down the road to Westlock, an indication of the new settlement's ascendancy over the older one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=record_detail&fl=0&lg=English&ex=471&rd=117778#|title=Century Settlers of the Edison - Westlock Area|author=|date=|website=www.virtualmuseum.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the new town is a [[portmanteau]] of the names of William Westgate and William Lockhart, who owned the property. Westlock was incorporated as a village on 16 March 1916, with a population of 65 residents. The first [[Reeve (Canada)|reeve]] was George MacTavish, and in that same year, the first [[grain elevator]] was built. The first [[bank branch]], the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Merchant's Bank]] opened its doors in 1918. A permanent brick [[school]]house was built in 1925. The [[Sisters of Charity]] of St. Vincent de Paul of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] operated a [[hospital]] out of a former house in 1927, and a purpose-built hospital, the Immaculata, was opened in 1928.  Westlock became a town on 7 January 1947 with a population of 854. That same year, the [[community hall|Memorial Hall]] was also built.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 1992 the Memorial Hall burned down, later to be replaced. In 1995, the hospital was replaced by the Westlock Health Care Centre, a somewhat controversial decision because several other communities in Alberta were facing hospital closures at the time. In 1997, the old hospital was demolished.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Population history\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = left\n|width       =\n|state       = collapsed\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    = ''Source: [[Statistics Canada]]''<br><ref name=2001census>{{cite web | title=Population and Dwelling Counts, for Canada, Provinces and Territories, and Census Divisions, 2001 and 1996 Censuses \u2013 100% Data (Alberta) | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/Table-CSD-D.cfm?PR=48 | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=2011censusABmunis/><ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|4817\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|4819\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5008\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|4823\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|5101\n}}\nIn the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census of Population]] conducted by [[Statistics Canada]], the Town of Westlock recorded a population of 5,101 living in 2,142 of its 2,333 total private dwellings, a {{percentage|{{#expr:5101-4823}}|4823|1}} change from its 2011 population of 4,823.

The majority of the housing stock (1,630) was constructed before 1986, while 430 units were built between 1986 and 2006.  The average value of owned dwellings was $148,083 (compared to Albertan average of $293,811).\n\n;Families and households\nThere were 2,060 households, of which 1,355 were considered ''census families'' in 2006, with an average of 2.8 persons per family, compared to an Alberta average of 3.0.  The median incomes in 2005 were $41,487 per household and $47,853 per census family, compared to the Alberta median incomes of $63,988 and $73,823 respectively.\n\n;Mother tongue\nIn 2006, there were 3,945 people who claimed English as their [[mother tongue]], 125 who chose French, and 10 who indicated both.  In addition, 600 claimed another language (besides English and French) as a mother tongue.  Every person in town claimed at least a working knowledge of English, 4,450 said it was their only language, 220 said they also knew French, not one person was unilingually Francophone.\n\n;Immigration, citizenship, and generation\nOf the population only 385 were immigrants, the majority of those (300) having arrived in Canada before 1991.  All but 55 people were Canadian citizens.  Most of the Canadian-born residents were from [[immigrant generations|third generation or more]] (2,470), or the second generation (955).\n\n;Mobility status\nThe majority of the population (3,980) had lived in the same house a year earlier, and most of those (2,525) had been in the same house five years earlier as well.\n\n;Aboriginals and visible minorities\nThere were 310 people who had [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal identity]].  There were 145 who reported being [[visible minorities]].\n\n;Educational attainment\nA large minority (1,385) of those residents aged 15 years and older (3,825) had no certificate, diploma, or degree.  1,100 of residents aged 15 years and older has a high school certificate or equivalent.\n\n;Occupation and industry\nThe total workforce was 2,155 people.  The most common occupations were in sales and service (660) and trades, transport and equipment operation (410).  The most common industries were ''other services'' (360), health care and social services (355), and retail trade (320).\n\n;Work location and transportation\nMost people claimed to work in Westlock, and only (255) indicated working in another municipality.  The majority (1,485) of those that had a regular workplace that was not their own home (1,950) commuted to work by private automobile.\n\n;Income\nOf all persons in Westlock aged 15 years and older with income in 2005, 11.0% reported being below the [[Poverty in Canada#Low-income cut-off (LICO)|low income cutoff]] before taxes.  For those under the age of 18, the rate was 10.4% (compared to Alberta averages of 12.2% and 14.2% respectively).\n\n== Economy ==\nThe area around Westlock is primarily [[agriculture in Canada|agricultural]], although there is some [[oilpatch|oil and gas]] activity. The main employers in town include the hotels and inns that cater to oilpatch workers, the [[farm implement]] dealerships, and some small manufacturing such as Wabash Manufacturing - Truck Trailers, and a [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement plant. Additionally, Westlock still retains its original purpose as a centre for the [[grain trade]], as CN still accepts grains from the remaining grain elevators, now owned by a [[new generation co-operative]], Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westlock.aghost.net/index.cfm?show=10&mid=8|title=Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD |website=westlock.aghost.net |accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> Also, Westlock is a centre of government as it is the location of Westlock County's [[List of municipal districts in Alberta#Office locations|municipal office]] and home of public<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfstaples.ca/|title=R.F.

As such, Westlock is the central town of the region where rural families do business, send their children to school, and obtain government services. Many rural people retire in the town, and there are several [[Retirement home|old age homes]].\n\nWestlock is too far from Edmonton to serve as a [[bedroom community]] but some people do commute. Of increasing importance to the community since the Second World War has been highway traffic heading to oilfields in [[Northern Alberta]]. Recent retail developments have shifted from the railway era [[downtown]] to larger malls and businesses along the highway. One recent proposal was for a residential development adjoining [[Westlock Airport]] which would allow people to commute to the [[oilsand]] projects in [[Fort McMurray]] and other northern developments, but this has not been started as yet.\n\n== Government ==\nWestlock's current [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]] is [[Arnold Viersen]], representing the riding of [[Peace River-Westlock]]. In the 2015 Canadian Federal Election Westlock became part of the newly formed [[Peace River\u2014Westlock]] federal electoral district. The [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]] who represents Westlock is [[Glenn van Dijken]].

Founded in 1913, the town is primarily an agricultural, business, and government administration centre serving communities and rural areas within surrounding [[Westlock County]].\n\n== Geography ==\nWestlock is located approximately {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], Alberta's provincial capital and Canada's [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|sixth largest]] [[census metropolitan area]].  Westlock sits at the junction of [[Alberta Highway 44|Highway 44]] and [[Alberta Highway 18|Highway 18]]. It is surrounded by Westlock County within [[Division No. 13, Alberta|Census Division 13]].\n\nWestlock lies on the [[Prairie Provinces|Alberta plain]], one of the [[Great Plains]].  It lies just to the north of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] [[river basins]], and to the east of the [[Pembina River (Alberta)|Pembina River]], a tributary of the Athabasca.  The town is about {{convert|670|m}} [[above mean sea level]].  Westlock sits within the [[humid continental climate]] zone, on the northern edge of the [[aspen parkland]] belt, a once heavily treed region that was cleared for agriculture at the turn of the 20th century.  It is a relatively fertile region of dark soils.  To the north lies the [[subarctic climate]] zone.  The mean annual precipitation averaged from one meteorological station within the county measured 468 millimetres (mm), based on data from 1980 to 1990. The mean annual temperature averaged 1.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the\nmean monthly temperature reaching a high of 16.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in July, and dropping to a low of -11.4&nbsp;\u00b0C in January.<ref>http://www.10714.com/pdf/rgwa/westlock.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Westlock was inhabited by [[First Nations]] people, notably the [[Cree]]. Although the [[fur trade]] had been active in Alberta since 1754 when [[Anthony Henday]] explored the area, the Westlock district was not mentioned in writing until [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] came through in April 1799.\n[[File:Edison, Alberta (1906).jpg|thumb|left|Post office in Edison, 1906]]\n\nWhite settlement did not begin until 1902 at that time centred on a [[rural]] community about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of present-day Westlock. The founding family was named Edgson,<ref>{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Daphne|title=Edison, the Way it was : the history of Edison|year=1980|publisher=Co-Op Press|location=Edmonton|page=25|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=249127}}</ref>  but this was considered too hard to pronounce. [[Edson, Alberta]] already existed, so the site was called Edison by its Irish-Canadian founders, after the American inventor [[Thomas Edison]].  The community in 1912 consisted of a total of no more than 13 buildings: a harness shop, a blacksmith shop, several homes, two churches, and one family living in a tent.  There was also a post office but this was closed in 1911 when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] came to power and fired many [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] from [[Canada Post|the postal service]].<ref>http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=display_original&lg=English&fl=0&rd=117752&ex=471</ref>  In 1911 the railway reached nearby [[Clyde, Alberta|Clyde]] to the east, and in 1912 the ''E.D. & B.C. Railway'' (later the [[Northern Alberta Railway]], now part of [[Canadian National|CN]]) mapped a new townsite where Westlock now stands to the west.  Edison was now caught between the two.  In 1914, the [[Methodist]] church building was picked up and moved down the road to Westlock, an indication of the new settlement's ascendancy over the older one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=record_detail&fl=0&lg=English&ex=471&rd=117778#|title=Century Settlers of the Edison - Westlock Area|author=|date=|website=www.virtualmuseum.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the new town is a [[portmanteau]] of the names of William Westgate and William Lockhart, who owned the property. Westlock was incorporated as a village on 16 March 1916, with a population of 65 residents. The first [[Reeve (Canada)|reeve]] was George MacTavish, and in that same year, the first [[grain elevator]] was built. The first [[bank branch]], the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Merchant's Bank]] opened its doors in 1918. A permanent brick [[school]]house was built in 1925. The [[Sisters of Charity]] of St. Vincent de Paul of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] operated a [[hospital]] out of a former house in 1927, and a purpose-built hospital, the Immaculata, was opened in 1928.  Westlock became a town on 7 January 1947 with a population of 854. That same year, the [[community hall|Memorial Hall]] was also built.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 1992 the Memorial Hall burned down, later to be replaced. In 1995, the hospital was replaced by the Westlock Health Care Centre, a somewhat controversial decision because several other communities in Alberta were facing hospital closures at the time. In 1997, the old hospital was demolished.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Population history\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = left\n|width       =\n|state       = collapsed\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    = ''Source: [[Statistics Canada]]''<br><ref name=2001census>{{cite web | title=Population and Dwelling Counts, for Canada, Provinces and Territories, and Census Divisions, 2001 and 1996 Censuses \u2013 100% Data (Alberta) | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/Table-CSD-D.cfm?PR=48 | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=2011censusABmunis/><ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|4817\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|4819\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5008\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|4823\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|5101\n}}\nIn the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census of Population]] conducted by [[Statistics Canada]], the Town of Westlock recorded a population of 5,101 living in 2,142 of its 2,333 total private dwellings, a {{percentage|{{#expr:5101-4823}}|4823|1}} change from its 2011 population of 4,823.

The majority of the housing stock (1,630) was constructed before 1986, while 430 units were built between 1986 and 2006.  The average value of owned dwellings was $148,083 (compared to Albertan average of $293,811).\n\n;Families and households\nThere were 2,060 households, of which 1,355 were considered ''census families'' in 2006, with an average of 2.8 persons per family, compared to an Alberta average of 3.0.  The median incomes in 2005 were $41,487 per household and $47,853 per census family, compared to the Alberta median incomes of $63,988 and $73,823 respectively.\n\n;Mother tongue\nIn 2006, there were 3,945 people who claimed English as their [[mother tongue]], 125 who chose French, and 10 who indicated both.  In addition, 600 claimed another language (besides English and French) as a mother tongue.  Every person in town claimed at least a working knowledge of English, 4,450 said it was their only language, 220 said they also knew French, not one person was unilingually Francophone.\n\n;Immigration, citizenship, and generation\nOf the population only 385 were immigrants, the majority of those (300) having arrived in Canada before 1991.  All but 55 people were Canadian citizens.  Most of the Canadian-born residents were from [[immigrant generations|third generation or more]] (2,470), or the second generation (955).\n\n;Mobility status\nThe majority of the population (3,980) had lived in the same house a year earlier, and most of those (2,525) had been in the same house five years earlier as well.\n\n;Aboriginals and visible minorities\nThere were 310 people who had [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal identity]].  There were 145 who reported being [[visible minorities]].\n\n;Educational attainment\nA large minority (1,385) of those residents aged 15 years and older (3,825) had no certificate, diploma, or degree.  1,100 of residents aged 15 years and older has a high school certificate or equivalent.\n\n;Occupation and industry\nThe total workforce was 2,155 people.  The most common occupations were in sales and service (660) and trades, transport and equipment operation (410).  The most common industries were ''other services'' (360), health care and social services (355), and retail trade (320).\n\n;Work location and transportation\nMost people claimed to work in Westlock, and only (255) indicated working in another municipality.  The majority (1,485) of those that had a regular workplace that was not their own home (1,950) commuted to work by private automobile.\n\n;Income\nOf all persons in Westlock aged 15 years and older with income in 2005, 11.0% reported being below the [[Poverty in Canada#Low-income cut-off (LICO)|low income cutoff]] before taxes.  For those under the age of 18, the rate was 10.4% (compared to Alberta averages of 12.2% and 14.2% respectively).\n\n== Economy ==\nThe area around Westlock is primarily [[agriculture in Canada|agricultural]], although there is some [[oilpatch|oil and gas]] activity. The main employers in town include the hotels and inns that cater to oilpatch workers, the [[farm implement]] dealerships, and some small manufacturing such as Wabash Manufacturing - Truck Trailers, and a [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement plant. Additionally, Westlock still retains its original purpose as a centre for the [[grain trade]], as CN still accepts grains from the remaining grain elevators, now owned by a [[new generation co-operative]], Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westlock.aghost.net/index.cfm?show=10&mid=8|title=Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD |website=westlock.aghost.net |accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> Also, Westlock is a centre of government as it is the location of Westlock County's [[List of municipal districts in Alberta#Office locations|municipal office]] and home of public<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfstaples.ca/|title=R.F. Staples Secondary School - Work Hard, Be Kind |website=R.F.

As such, Westlock is the central town of the region where rural families do business, send their children to school, and obtain government services. Many rural people retire in the town, and there are several [[Retirement home|old age homes]].\n\nWestlock is too far from Edmonton to serve as a [[bedroom community]] but some people do commute. Of increasing importance to the community since the Second World War has been highway traffic heading to oilfields in [[Northern Alberta]]. Recent retail developments have shifted from the railway era [[downtown]] to larger malls and businesses along the highway. One recent proposal was for a residential development adjoining [[Westlock Airport]] which would allow people to commute to the [[oilsand]] projects in [[Fort McMurray]] and other northern developments, but this has not been started as yet.\n\n== Government ==\nWestlock's current [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]] is [[Arnold Viersen]], representing the riding of [[Peace River-Westlock]]. In the 2015 Canadian Federal Election Westlock became part of the newly formed [[Peace River\u2014Westlock]] federal electoral district. The [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]] who represents Westlock is [[Glenn van Dijken]].
