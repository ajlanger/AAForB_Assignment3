They were transported much further north, to barren hamlets at [[Grise Fiord]] and [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]] in what is now Nunavut in an effort to demonstrate Canada's legal occupation of these territories and thereby assert sovereignty in the High [[Arctic]] by increasing its population during the [[Cold War]]. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.<ref>[http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html Grise Fiord: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228115824/http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> They were told that they would be returned home to Nunavik after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the High Arctic area and the Inuit were forced to stay.

Nunavik shares a border with the [[C\u00f4te-Nord]] region of Quebec and the [[Labrador]] region of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] forms the northern two-thirds of the region. There are no road links between Nunavik and southern Quebec, although the [[Trans-Taiga Road]] of the [[Jam\u00e9sie]] region ends near the [[55th parallel north|55th parallel]] on the [[Caniapiscau Reservoir]], several hundred kilometers south of Kuujjuaq. There is a year-round air link to all villages and seasonal shipping in the summer and autumn. Parts of the interior of southern Nunavik can be reached using several trails which head north from [[Schefferville]].\n[[File:Flag of Nunavik (Thomassie Mangiok).svg|alt=Proposed Nunavik flag|thumb|Proposed Nunavik flag]]\nNunavik has fourteen villages, the vast majority of whose residents are Inuit.<ref name=\"UW\">{{cite web|title=The Nunavik Inuit|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/canada/file/Nunavik%20Inuit-e-v1-1.pdf|website=University of Washington|accessdate=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624050532/http://jsis.washington.edu/canada//file/Nunavik%20Inuit-e-v1-1.pdf|archive-date=24 June 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The principal village and administrative centre in Nunavik is [[Kuujjuaq]], on the southern shore of Ungava Bay; the other villages are [[Inukjuak]] (where the film ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' was shot), [[Salluit]], [[Puvirnituq]], [[Ivujivik]], [[Kangiqsujuaq, Quebec|Kangiqsujuaq]], [[Kangiqsualujjuaq]], [[Kangirsuk]], [[Tasiujaq]], [[Aupaluk]], [[Akulivik]], [[Quaqtaq, Quebec|Quaqtaq]], [[Kuujjuarapik]] and [[Umiujaq]].

They possess distinct genetic signatures in pathways linked to lipid metabolism, allowing them to adjust to higher-fat diets and the extreme temperature of the Canadian Arctic. Geographically isolated populations often develop unique genetic traits that result from their successful adaptation to specific environments. Their closest relatives are the [[Paleo-Eskimos]], a people that inhabited the Arctic before the Inuit. <ref>[https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-nunavik-inuit-14549/ ''Study finds Nunavik Inuit are genetically unique'']</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Villages/<br />regions<ref>{{cite web|author1=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|title=Ethnic composition of the population, Nunavik (villages), Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec and Qu\u00e9bec|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|language=English|date=2006}}</ref>\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Total<br />population\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Non-<br />aboriginal\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Non-<br />aboriginal\n|-\n| Akulivik\n| 507\n| 500\n| 7\n| 98.6\n| 1.4\n|-\n| Aupaluk\n| 174\n| n.a.\u00b2\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Inukjuak\n| 1,597\n| 1,340\n| 85\n| 83.9\n| 5.3\n|- \n| Ivujivik\n| 349\n| 340\n| 0\n| 97.4\n| 0.0\n|- \n| Kangiqsualujjuaq\n| 735\n| 705\n| 30\n| 95.9\n| 4.1\n|-\n| Kangirsujuaq\n| 605\n| 560\n| 50\n| 92.6\n| 8.3\n|-\n| Kangirsuk\n| 466\n| 425\n| 45\n| 91.2\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Kuujjuaq\n| 2,132\n| 1,635\n| 460\n| 76.7\n| 21.6\n|-\n| Kuujjuarapik\n| 568\n| 465\n| 55\n| 81.9\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Puvirnituq\n| 1,457\n| 1,385\n| 40\n| 95.1\n| 2.7\n|-\n| Quaqtaq\n| 315\n| 300\n| 10\n| 95.2\n| 3.2\n|-\n| Salluit\n| 1,241\n| 1,150\n| 85\n| 92.7\n| 6.8\n|-\n| Tasiujaq\n| 248\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Umiujaq\n| 390\n| 375\n| 10\n| 96.2\n| 2.6\n|-\n| Nunavik\n| 10,784\n| 9,565\n| 920\n| 88.7\n| 8.5\n|-\n| Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec\n| 39,550\n| 9,625\n| 16,020\n| 24.3\n| 40.5\n|-\n| Qu\u00e9bec\n| 7,435,905\n| 10,950\n| 7,327,475\n| 0.1\n| 98.5\n|-\n|}\n\n===Language===\nThe following table does not include Canada's official languages of French and English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!colspan=3| Mother tongue, 2011 NHS Survey<ref>{{cite web|author1=National Household Survey (NHS)|title=Non-official language, Nunavik and communities|url=https://www.nunivaat.org/documents/20150422/2015-04-22-05.pdf|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=English|date=2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Rank\n!align=\"left\"| Language\n!Population\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|1.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Inuktitut\n| 10 870\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|2.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Spanish\n| 80\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|3.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cree languages\n| 70\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|4.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other Aboriginal language\n| 35\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|5.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other non-Aboriginal language\n| 15\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Arabic\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Creoles\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|German\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Portuguese\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Niger-Congo languages\n|10\n|}\n\n==Economy==\nNunavik is rich in mineral deposits where [[Raglan Mine]], situated near Salluit, is one of the largest mines in the region. It is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at [[Kattiniq/Donaldson Airport]] and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay. Production began at the mine in 1997. The current mine life is estimated at more than 30 years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nBecause the site is situated in the subarctic [[permafrost]] region, it requires special construction and mining techniques to protect the fragile permafrost and to address other environmental issues. The average annual temperature is {{convert|-10|C}} with an average ambient temperature underground of {{convert|-15|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} There are plans to increase production at a new mine in Raglan South.\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe villages of Nunavik are populated predominately by Inuit. Much like their Nunavummiut neighbours to the North, the Nunavimmiut carve sculptures from soapstone and eat primarily caribou and fish. On clear nights, the aurora is often visible, and outdoors activities are abundant in this region. \n\n==Government==\nNunavik, along with the Quebec portion of the James Bay region (or Jam\u00e9sie in French), is part of the administrative region of Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec. The [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] of 1978 led to greater political autonomy for most of the Nunavik region with the founding of the [[Kativik Regional Government]]. All inhabitants of the 14 northern villages, both Inuit and non-Inuit, vote in regional elections. The Kativik Regional Government is financed by the [[Government of Quebec]] (50%), the [[Government of Canada]] (25%), and local revenues (25%).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}The Agreement also led to the creation of the [[Kativik Regional Police Force]], which provides police services in the [[Kativik Regional Government|Kativik]] region since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krpf.ca/en/about/general-information|title=General Information|last=KRPF|website=Home|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Makivik Corporation]], headquartered in Kuujjuaq, represents the Inuit of Northern Quebec in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada. They are seeking greater political autonomy for the region and have recently negotiated an agreement defining their traditional rights to use the resources of the offshore islands of Nunavik, all of which are part of Nunavut.\n\nThe Cree village of Whapmagoostui, which forms an enclave on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, is part of the Cree Regional Authority, which itself has been incorporated into the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee)]].  The [[Naskapi]] Nation of Kawawachikamach, of the C\u00f4te-Nord region to the south of Nunavik, owns an exclusive hunting and trapping area in southern Nunavik and is represented in the Kativik Regional Government.\n\n===Regional Government of Nunavik===\nThe governments of Quebec and Canada and Nunavik had negotiated a proposal to establish a Regional Government of Nunavik. This is in part a recognition of the region's political distinctiveness, having a different language, culture, climate and voting pattern than the rest of the province of Quebec, as well as part of the overall trend towards [[devolution]] of Canada's arctic territories. While Quebec and Canada would still maintain full jurisdiction over the area, the Nunavik government will have an elected parliamentary-style council and cabinet, and a public service funded by the province and responsible for delivering certain social services such as education and health. The regional government would have also had rights to the region's natural resources, including royalties from the various mines in the region.  This proposal was rejected by about 66% of voters in a referendum in 2011.  It is expected that negotiations will continue in the future to work to establish a more autonomous government for Nunavik in the future.\n\nThe government will be based on territory, not ethnicity, so that all people residing in Nunavik can be full participants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Makivik Corporation |author2=Government of Quebec |author3=Government of Canada |title=Agreement in Principle Concerning the Amalgamation of Certain Public Institutions and Creation of the Nunavik Regional Government |url=http://www.nunavikgovernment.ca/en/documents/AIP%20-%20EP%20trilingual%20version.pdf |publisher=The Nunavik Regional Government negotiations website |page=8 |language=French, Inuktitut, English |date=11 July 2007 |quote=The Nunavik Regional Government shall be a public institution for all Nunavik residents, notably regarding the access to services and the eligibility for positions and responsibilities. |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Existing government structures, such as the Kativik Regional Government, Kativik School Board, and Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, will be folded into the new regional government.\n\nThe Quebec government has also expressed a desire to add an additional seat to the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] to represent Nunavik, despite the region's small population. Currently, Nunavik is part of the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Ungava (electoral district)|Ungava]], its residents making up just under half of the riding's population. As a riding, Nunavik would be the second least populous in Quebec, slightly more populous than [[\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine (provincial electoral district)|\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine]], which is able to exist as a separate riding under an exception to the laws on population distribution by riding.<ref>Chouinard, Tommy.

Parts of the interior of southern Nunavik can be reached using several trails which head north from [[Schefferville]].\n[[File:Flag of Nunavik (Thomassie Mangiok).svg|alt=Proposed Nunavik flag|thumb|Proposed Nunavik flag]]\nNunavik has fourteen villages, the vast majority of whose residents are Inuit.<ref name=\"UW\">{{cite web|title=The Nunavik Inuit|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/canada/file/Nunavik%20Inuit-e-v1-1.pdf|website=University of Washington|accessdate=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624050532/http://jsis.washington.edu/canada//file/Nunavik%20Inuit-e-v1-1.pdf|archive-date=24 June 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The principal village and administrative centre in Nunavik is [[Kuujjuaq]], on the southern shore of Ungava Bay; the other villages are [[Inukjuak]] (where the film ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' was shot), [[Salluit]], [[Puvirnituq]], [[Ivujivik]], [[Kangiqsujuaq, Quebec|Kangiqsujuaq]], [[Kangiqsualujjuaq]], [[Kangirsuk]], [[Tasiujaq]], [[Aupaluk]], [[Akulivik]], [[Quaqtaq, Quebec|Quaqtaq]], [[Kuujjuarapik]] and [[Umiujaq]].

They possess distinct genetic signatures in pathways linked to lipid metabolism, allowing them to adjust to higher-fat diets and the extreme temperature of the Canadian Arctic. Geographically isolated populations often develop unique genetic traits that result from their successful adaptation to specific environments. Their closest relatives are the [[Paleo-Eskimos]], a people that inhabited the Arctic before the Inuit. <ref>[https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-nunavik-inuit-14549/ ''Study finds Nunavik Inuit are genetically unique'']</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Villages/<br />regions<ref>{{cite web|author1=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|title=Ethnic composition of the population, Nunavik (villages), Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec and Qu\u00e9bec|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|language=English|date=2006}}</ref>\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Total<br />population\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Non-<br />aboriginal\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Non-<br />aboriginal\n|-\n| Akulivik\n| 507\n| 500\n| 7\n| 98.6\n| 1.4\n|-\n| Aupaluk\n| 174\n| n.a.\u00b2\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Inukjuak\n| 1,597\n| 1,340\n| 85\n| 83.9\n| 5.3\n|- \n| Ivujivik\n| 349\n| 340\n| 0\n| 97.4\n| 0.0\n|- \n| Kangiqsualujjuaq\n| 735\n| 705\n| 30\n| 95.9\n| 4.1\n|-\n| Kangirsujuaq\n| 605\n| 560\n| 50\n| 92.6\n| 8.3\n|-\n| Kangirsuk\n| 466\n| 425\n| 45\n| 91.2\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Kuujjuaq\n| 2,132\n| 1,635\n| 460\n| 76.7\n| 21.6\n|-\n| Kuujjuarapik\n| 568\n| 465\n| 55\n| 81.9\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Puvirnituq\n| 1,457\n| 1,385\n| 40\n| 95.1\n| 2.7\n|-\n| Quaqtaq\n| 315\n| 300\n| 10\n| 95.2\n| 3.2\n|-\n| Salluit\n| 1,241\n| 1,150\n| 85\n| 92.7\n| 6.8\n|-\n| Tasiujaq\n| 248\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Umiujaq\n| 390\n| 375\n| 10\n| 96.2\n| 2.6\n|-\n| Nunavik\n| 10,784\n| 9,565\n| 920\n| 88.7\n| 8.5\n|-\n| Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec\n| 39,550\n| 9,625\n| 16,020\n| 24.3\n| 40.5\n|-\n| Qu\u00e9bec\n| 7,435,905\n| 10,950\n| 7,327,475\n| 0.1\n| 98.5\n|-\n|}\n\n===Language===\nThe following table does not include Canada's official languages of French and English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!colspan=3| Mother tongue, 2011 NHS Survey<ref>{{cite web|author1=National Household Survey (NHS)|title=Non-official language, Nunavik and communities|url=https://www.nunivaat.org/documents/20150422/2015-04-22-05.pdf|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=English|date=2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Rank\n!align=\"left\"| Language\n!Population\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|1.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Inuktitut\n| 10 870\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|2.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Spanish\n| 80\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|3.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cree languages\n| 70\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|4.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other Aboriginal language\n| 35\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|5.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other non-Aboriginal language\n| 15\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Arabic\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Creoles\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|German\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Portuguese\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Niger-Congo languages\n|10\n|}\n\n==Economy==\nNunavik is rich in mineral deposits where [[Raglan Mine]], situated near Salluit, is one of the largest mines in the region. It is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at [[Kattiniq/Donaldson Airport]] and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay. Production began at the mine in 1997. The current mine life is estimated at more than 30 years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nBecause the site is situated in the subarctic [[permafrost]] region, it requires special construction and mining techniques to protect the fragile permafrost and to address other environmental issues. The average annual temperature is {{convert|-10|C}} with an average ambient temperature underground of {{convert|-15|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} There are plans to increase production at a new mine in Raglan South.\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe villages of Nunavik are populated predominately by Inuit. Much like their Nunavummiut neighbours to the North, the Nunavimmiut carve sculptures from soapstone and eat primarily caribou and fish. On clear nights, the aurora is often visible, and outdoors activities are abundant in this region. \n\n==Government==\nNunavik, along with the Quebec portion of the James Bay region (or Jam\u00e9sie in French), is part of the administrative region of Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec. The [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] of 1978 led to greater political autonomy for most of the Nunavik region with the founding of the [[Kativik Regional Government]]. All inhabitants of the 14 northern villages, both Inuit and non-Inuit, vote in regional elections. The Kativik Regional Government is financed by the [[Government of Quebec]] (50%), the [[Government of Canada]] (25%), and local revenues (25%).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}The Agreement also led to the creation of the [[Kativik Regional Police Force]], which provides police services in the [[Kativik Regional Government|Kativik]] region since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krpf.ca/en/about/general-information|title=General Information|last=KRPF|website=Home|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Makivik Corporation]], headquartered in Kuujjuaq, represents the Inuit of Northern Quebec in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada. They are seeking greater political autonomy for the region and have recently negotiated an agreement defining their traditional rights to use the resources of the offshore islands of Nunavik, all of which are part of Nunavut.\n\nThe Cree village of Whapmagoostui, which forms an enclave on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, is part of the Cree Regional Authority, which itself has been incorporated into the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee)]].  The [[Naskapi]] Nation of Kawawachikamach, of the C\u00f4te-Nord region to the south of Nunavik, owns an exclusive hunting and trapping area in southern Nunavik and is represented in the Kativik Regional Government.\n\n===Regional Government of Nunavik===\nThe governments of Quebec and Canada and Nunavik had negotiated a proposal to establish a Regional Government of Nunavik. This is in part a recognition of the region's political distinctiveness, having a different language, culture, climate and voting pattern than the rest of the province of Quebec, as well as part of the overall trend towards [[devolution]] of Canada's arctic territories. While Quebec and Canada would still maintain full jurisdiction over the area, the Nunavik government will have an elected parliamentary-style council and cabinet, and a public service funded by the province and responsible for delivering certain social services such as education and health. The regional government would have also had rights to the region's natural resources, including royalties from the various mines in the region.  This proposal was rejected by about 66% of voters in a referendum in 2011.  It is expected that negotiations will continue in the future to work to establish a more autonomous government for Nunavik in the future.\n\nThe government will be based on territory, not ethnicity, so that all people residing in Nunavik can be full participants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Makivik Corporation |author2=Government of Quebec |author3=Government of Canada |title=Agreement in Principle Concerning the Amalgamation of Certain Public Institutions and Creation of the Nunavik Regional Government |url=http://www.nunavikgovernment.ca/en/documents/AIP%20-%20EP%20trilingual%20version.pdf |publisher=The Nunavik Regional Government negotiations website |page=8 |language=French, Inuktitut, English |date=11 July 2007 |quote=The Nunavik Regional Government shall be a public institution for all Nunavik residents, notably regarding the access to services and the eligibility for positions and responsibilities. |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Existing government structures, such as the Kativik Regional Government, Kativik School Board, and Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, will be folded into the new regional government.\n\nThe Quebec government has also expressed a desire to add an additional seat to the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] to represent Nunavik, despite the region's small population. Currently, Nunavik is part of the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Ungava (electoral district)|Ungava]], its residents making up just under half of the riding's population. As a riding, Nunavik would be the second least populous in Quebec, slightly more populous than [[\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine (provincial electoral district)|\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine]], which is able to exist as a separate riding under an exception to the laws on population distribution by riding.<ref>Chouinard, Tommy.
