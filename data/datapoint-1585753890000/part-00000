The population was 1,316 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The village is located within the [[Black Creek (town), Wisconsin|Town of Black Creek]].\nOrigins of the community trace back to 1862 when it was settled by [[American Civil War]] veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham. Initially, the village had been referred to as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. However, the name was later changed to reflect the dark-colored creek along the outskirts of the community following village [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"sievert\"/> \nToday, Black Creek hosts a variety of community events including the annual Family Daze celebration.\nThe mayor of Black Creek, Wisconsin is Lance Mursau\n\n==History==\n[[File:MainStreetSouthBlackCreekWI1907.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street looking south c.1907]]\n\nIn the [[Menominee language]], Black Creek is known as ''En\u0101\u0113nohnyah'', \"Little Walks Plainly\", which is a man's name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|date=|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref> The territory where Black Creek is today was originally occupied by several different [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] nations.

The community had been known as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to the larger communities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. After village [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1904, the settlement was renamed Black Creek to reflect the dark-colored creek along the northern edge of the community.

The population was 1,316 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The village is located within the [[Black Creek (town), Wisconsin|Town of Black Creek]].\nOrigins of the community trace back to 1862 when it was settled by [[American Civil War]] veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham. Initially, the village had been referred to as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. However, the name was later changed to reflect the dark-colored creek along the outskirts of the community following village [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"sievert\"/> \nToday, Black Creek hosts a variety of community events including the annual Family Daze celebration.\n\n==History==\n[[File:MainStreetSouthBlackCreekWI1907.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street looking south c.1907]]\n\nIn the [[Menominee language]], Black Creek is known as ''En\u0101\u0113nohnyah'', \"Little Walks Plainly\", which is a man's name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|date=|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref> The territory where Black Creek is today was originally occupied by several different [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] nations. The [[Menominee]] ceded the territory in the 1836 [[Treaty of the Cedars]], while the [[Ho-Chunk]] were pressured into selling their land and illegally removed from the area before the eight year grace period guaranteed in their 1837 treaty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpm.edu/content/wirp/ICW-105.html|title=Ho-Chunk Treaties and Treaty Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Indian Country Wisconsin|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:North Main Street Black Creek WI c.1917.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street looking north c.1917]]\n\nThe village of Black Creek was then settled by [[American Civil War]] veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham L. Burdick, in 1862. The community had been known as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to the larger communities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. After village [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1904, the settlement was renamed Black Creek to reflect the dark-colored creek along the northern edge of the community. Black Creek's first village president was, politician and businessman, [[Charles J. Hagen]].<ref>[http://www.foxvalleymemory.org/ryans/PDFfiles/PART7.pdf \"History of Outagamie County\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305052625/http://www.foxvalleymemory.org/ryans/PDFfiles/PART7.pdf |date=March 5, 2016 }}.

The village school serves grades pre-K through 8th.\n\nBlack Creek's original schoolhouse was constructed in 1874 and condemned in 1900. A replacement two-story school, built along present-day State Street ([[WIS 54]]), was used until 1954. Because of lack of space, the school system also rented the former community auditorium, along Maple Street, for various school functions from 1937 to 1957.\n\nToday's village school was constructed in 1954. After a major building expansion in 1957, the one-room schoolhouses in the surrounding vicinity closed, and the students transferred to the grade school, doubling the enrollment. [[Kindergarten]], art, music, and [[physical education]] programs were also added that year. Since then, the school has expanded in 1969, 1987, and 2008.<ref name=\"sievert\"/>\n\n[[Seymour Community High School]] serves as the village and surrounding area high school.\n\nThe Black Creek Village Public Library is a member of the Outagamie Waupaca Library System (OWLS).<ref>\n [http://owlsweb.org/owls/directory/ \"Member Libraries\"].
