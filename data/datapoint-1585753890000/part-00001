Located on the [[Ohio River]] in [[downtown Cincinnati]], the stadium was best known as the home of \"[[The Big Red Machine]]\", as the Reds were often called in the 1970s.\n\nConstruction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed at a cost of less than $50 million. On June 30, 1970, the Reds hosted the [[Atlanta Braves]] in their grand opening, with [[Hank Aaron]] hitting the first ever home run at Riverfront. Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront hosted the [[1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star [[Pete Rose]] and catcher [[Ray Fosse]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]].\n\nIn September 1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed \"Cinergy Field\" in a sponsorship deal with [[Greater Cincinnati]] energy company [[Cinergy]]. In [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], to make room for [[Great American Ball Park]], the [[seating capacity]] at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000. There was a huge in-play wall in center field visible after the renovations, to serve as the [[batter's eye]]. The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002.\n\n==History==\nRiverfront was a multi-purpose, circular [[cookie-cutter stadium|\"cookie-cutter\" stadium]], one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as communities sought to save money by having their [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]] teams share the same facility. Riverfront, [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Shea Stadium]] in New York and [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. all opened within a few years of each other and were largely indistinguishable from one another; in particular, it was often confused with fellow [[Ohio River]] cookie-cutter Three Rivers Stadium by sportscasters because of the two stadium's similar names and similar designs.\n\nOne feature of Riverfront that distinguished it from other cookie-cutters was that the lower level  seats for baseball, from home plate to the left field foul line, were wheeled for conversion to a football seating configuration.<ref>http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/past/RiverfrontStadium.htm</ref>  The astroturf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left field during Reds games.  (Shea Stadium in New York had featured a similar movable field-level seats design from its debut in 1964 until the Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey in 1984, after which the Mets retrofitted Shea for exclusive baseball use.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/nym/ballpark/history.jsp</ref>  A variation of this design was also used at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in Pittsburgh.)<ref>http://www.steelersfever.com/three_rivers_stadium.html</ref>\n\nThe site Riverfront Stadium sat on originally included the 2nd Street [[tenement]], birthplace and boyhood home of [[cowboy]] singer and actor [[Roy Rogers]], who joked that he was born \"somewhere between second base and center field.\"\n\nRiverfront Stadium's scoreboard was designed by [[American Sign and Indicator]], but in its last years was maintained by [[Trans-Lux]].  That scoreboard would be upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of an adjacent Sony [[JumboTron]].\n\n===Big Red Machine===\n\nThe Reds moved to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season, after spending over 86 years at the intersection of Findlay Street and Western Avenue \u2013 the last 57\u00bd of those years at [[Crosley Field]].  Riverfront quickly earned a place in Cincinnati's century-long baseball tradition as the home of one of the best teams in baseball history.  The Reds had only won three pennants in their final 39 years at Crosley Field (1939, 1940, 1961) but made the [[World Series]] in Riverfront's first year (1970) and a total of four times in the stadium's first seven years, with the Reds winning back-to-back championships in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and [[1976 World Series|1976]]. The World Series would return in [[1990 World Series|1990]], with Cincinnati winning the first two of a four-game sweep of the [[Oakland Athletics]] at Riverfront.\n\n[[File:RedsOpeningDay1995.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The turf infield and dirt \"slide pits\" can be seen in this April 1995 photograph.]]Baseball purists disliked Riverfront's [[artificial turf]], but Reds' Manager [[Sparky Anderson]] and General Manager [[Bob Howsam]] took advantage of it by encouraging speed and line drive hitting that could produce doubles, triples and high-bouncing infield hits. Players who combined power and speed like [[Joe Morgan]], [[Pete Rose]] and [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]] thrived there. On defense, the fast surface and virtually dirtless infield (see photo) rewarded range and quickness by both outfielders and infielders, like shortstop [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] who used the turf to bounce many of his long throws to first. [[Catcher]] [[Johnny Bench]] and [[first baseman]] [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] played here. The artificial turf covered not only the normal grass area of the ballpark but also most of the normally dirt-covered portion of the infield. Only the pitcher's mound, the home plate area (in two circled areas), and cutouts around first, second and third bases had dirt surfaces (which were covered in five-sided diamond shaped areas). This was the first stadium in the majors with this \"sliding pit\" configuration. The new stadiums that would follow ([[Veterans Stadium]], [[Royals Stadium]], [[Louisiana Superdome]], [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)]], [[Exhibition Stadium]], [[Kingdome]], [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], [[B.C. Place]], [[SkyDome]]) installed sliding pits as the original layout, and the existing artificial turf fields in [[Candlestick Park|San Francisco]], [[Astrodome|Houston]], [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]], and [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]] would change to the cut-out configuration within the next few years.\n\nRiverfront hosted the MLB All-Star Game twice: first on July 14, 1970 with President [[Richard Nixon]] in attendance (51,838 total attendance), and again on July 12, 1988 (55,837 attendance).\n\n===Professional football===\nDespite Cincinnati's love of baseball, it was the prospect of a professional football team that finally moved the city to end 20 years of discussion and build a new stadium on the downtown riverfront. After playing for two seasons at [[Nippert Stadium]] on the [[University of Cincinnati]]  campus, the Bengals built on the Reds' success in the stadium's first year when they recorded their first winning season and playoff appearance in 1970, just their third year of existence.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable football game at Riverfront was the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] on January 10, 1982. The game became known as the ''[[Freezer Bowl]]'' and was won by the Bengals over the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u20137. The air temperature during the game was {{convert|-9|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and the [[wind chill]] was {{convert|-37|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, the coldest in NFL history. The win earned the Bengals their first of two trips to the [[Super Bowl]] ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]]) while playing at Riverfront.\n\nRiverfront Stadium hosted the 1988 AFC Championship, as the Bengals beat the [[Buffalo Bills]] 21&ndash;10 to advance to [[Super Bowl XXIII|their second Super Bowl appearance]].\n\nDuring the Bengals' tenure, they defeated every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect records against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] (4-0), [[New York Giants]] (4-0), and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (3-0). They posted a 5\u20131 record in playoff games played in Riverfront Stadium, with victories over the [[Buffalo Bills]] (twice), [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Houston Oilers]]. Their only home playoff loss came to the [[New York Jets]].\n\nFor most of the Bengals' tenure at the stadium, the field contained only the basic markings required for play. Until the late 1990s, there wasn't a logo at midfield or any writing in the end zone, which had long become standard in NFL stadiums.\n\nDuring the 1988 season as the Bengals were making another [[Super Bowl XXIII|Super Bowl]] run, Riverfront Stadium was nicknamed the Jungle as the Bengals went a perfect 10-0 at home during the regular season and in the playoffs.  With the new stadium nickname, the fans and team adopted the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\" as the unofficial theme song for the Bengals.  When [[Paul Brown Stadium]] opened in 2000, the Jungle theme was incorporated into the stadium design.\n\n===College football===\nBetween 1970 and 1990 Riverfront Stadium hosted 25 [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati football]] games to accommodate higher-caliber visiting teams and local rivals which would overwhelm demand in their usual home, [[Nippert Stadium]] (which then could only hold 28,000). Among the Bearcats' opponents were the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]], [[Maryland Terrapins football|University of Maryland]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|University of Kentucky]], [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]], [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State University]], whose [[1985 NCAA Division I-A football season|1985]] game took place with the Nittany Lions number one in the coaches' poll, and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] three times, twice while the Hurricanes were the defending national champions. It would be a temporary full-time home for the Bearcats during the 1990 season, when Nippert Stadium was undergoing renovations.\n\nThe Bearcats finished with a 12\u201313 all-time record at Riverfront.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Date|Home Team|Opponent|Score|Attendance}}\n|-\n| September 19, 1970\n| '''[[1970 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1970|team=Dayton Flyers|title=Dayton}}\n| 13\u20137\n| \n|-\n| November 8, 1975\n| [[1975 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 16 [[1975 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]]'''\n| 19\u201321\n| 16,478\n|-\n| September 11, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 38\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 9, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Long Beach State 49ers football team|Long Beach State]]\n| 34\u201314\n|\n|-\n| November 13, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1982|team=Morgan State Bears|title=Morgan State}}\n| 52\u20130\n|\n|-\n| November 18, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 20\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 1, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Cornell Big Red|title=Cornell}}\n| 48\u201320\n|\n|-\n| October 8, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}\n| 31\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 22, 1983\n| [[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 8 [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 7\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1983 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers]]\n| 18\u20137\n|\n|-\n| November 12, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Memphis Tigers|title=Memphis State}}\n| 43\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 13, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 10 [[1984 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 25\u201349\n|\n|-\n| October 27, 1984\n| '''[[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1984 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 40\u201321\n|\n|-\n| November 17, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]'''\n| 7\u201329\n|\n|-\n| November 22, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 26\u201331\n|\n|-\n| October 5, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''{{cfb link|year=1985|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}'''\n| 16\u201328\n|\n|-\n| October 26, 1985\n| '''[[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1985 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]\n| 24\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 9, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 2 [[1985 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]]'''\n| 10\u201331\n|\n|-\n| September 13, 1986\n| '''[[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1986 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 45\u201338\n|\n|-\n| September 27, 1986\n| [[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1986 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]]'''\n| 20\u201337\n|\n|-\n| October 24, 1987\n| [[1987 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1987 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 10\u201348\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1988\n| [[1988 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1988 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]'''\n| 13\u201351\n|\n|-\n| September 2, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Bowling Green Falcons football team|Bowling Green]]'''\n| 20\u201334\n|\n|-\n| September 22, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 12\u201316\n|\n|-\n| November 3, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 25 [[1990 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]'''\n| 16\u201341\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 University of Cincinnati Football Media Guide |url=https://gobearcats.com/documents/2015/4/30/09fbguide_151-198.pdf |publisher=gobearcats.com |accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Final years as a baseball-only stadium===\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 3.jpg|thumb|left|Cinergy Field after the left and center field stands were removed.]]\nWhen the Bengals moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], the Reds were left as Cinergy Field's only tenant. Prior to the [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] baseball season, the stadium was remodeled into a baseball-only configuration, and the artificial surface was replaced with grass.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cinergy Field during a Cincinnati Reds game vs. the St. Louis Cardinals on August 23, 2001. Construction of Great American Ballpark is visible in the background.]]\nTo allow room for the construction of [[Great American Ball Park]] (which was being built largely over the grounds the stadium already sat on), a large section of the left and center field stands were removed and the distance to the fences was shortened by {{convert|5|ft}}. A {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} wall was built in deep center field to prevent easy home runs. The new Great American Ball Park and old Riverfront Stadium were 26&nbsp;inches apart at its closest point during this time. In the Reds' final two seasons in the stadium, ongoing construction on Great American was plainly visible just beyond the outfield walls while the team played their games.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field Implosion.JPG|thumb|left|December 29, 2002 implosion.]]\n[[File:Cinergylot.png|thumb|right|The Riverfront Stadium site in June 2006.

Located on the [[Ohio River]] in [[downtown Cincinnati]], the stadium was best known as the home of \"[[The Big Red Machine]]\", as the Reds were often called in the 1970s.\n\nConstruction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed at a cost of less than $50 million. On June 30, 1970, the Reds hosted the [[Atlanta Braves]] in their grand opening, with [[Hank Aaron]] hitting the first ever home run at Riverfront. Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront hosted the [[1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star [[Pete Rose]] and catcher [[Ray Fosse]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]].\n\nIn September 1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed \"Cinergy Field\" in a sponsorship deal with [[Greater Cincinnati]] energy company [[Cinergy]]. In [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], to make room for [[Great American Ball Park]], the [[seating capacity]] at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000. There was a huge in-play wall in center field visible after the renovations, to serve as the [[batter's eye]]. The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002.\n\n==History==\nRiverfront was a multi-purpose, circular [[cookie-cutter stadium|\"cookie-cutter\" stadium]], one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as communities sought to save money by having their [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]] teams share the same facility. Riverfront, [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Shea Stadium]] in New York and [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. all opened within a few years of each other and were largely indistinguishable from one another; in particular, it was often confused with fellow [[Ohio River]] cookie-cutter Three Rivers Stadium by sportscasters because of the two stadium's similar names and similar designs.\n\nOne feature of Riverfront that distinguished it from other cookie-cutters was that the lower level  seats for baseball, from home plate to the left field foul line, were wheeled for conversion to a football seating configuration.<ref>http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/past/RiverfrontStadium.htm</ref>  The astroturf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left field during Reds games.  (Shea Stadium in New York had featured a similar movable field-level seats design from its debut in 1964 until the Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey in 1984, after which the Mets retrofitted Shea for exclusive baseball use.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/nym/ballpark/history.jsp</ref>  A variation of this design was also used at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in Pittsburgh.)<ref>http://www.steelersfever.com/three_rivers_stadium.html</ref>\n\nThe site Riverfront Stadium sat on originally included the 2nd Street [[tenement]], birthplace and boyhood home of [[cowboy]] singer and actor [[Roy Rogers]], who joked that he was born \"somewhere between second base and center field.\"\n\nRiverfront Stadium's scoreboard was designed by [[American Sign and Indicator]], but in its last years was maintained by [[Trans-Lux]].  That scoreboard would be upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of an adjacent Sony [[JumboTron]].\n\n===Big Red Machine===\n\nThe Reds moved to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season, after spending over 86 years at the intersection of Findlay Street and Western Avenue \u2013 the last 57\u00bd of those years at [[Crosley Field]].  Riverfront quickly earned a place in Cincinnati's century-long baseball tradition as the home of one of the best teams in baseball history.  The Reds had only won three pennants in their final 39 years at Crosley Field (1939, 1940, 1961) but made the [[World Series]] in Riverfront's first year (1970) and a total of four times in the stadium's first seven years, with the Reds winning back-to-back championships in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and [[1976 World Series|1976]]. The World Series would return in [[1990 World Series|1990]], with Cincinnati winning the first two of a four-game sweep of the [[Oakland Athletics]] at Riverfront.\n\n[[File:RedsOpeningDay1995.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The turf infield and dirt \"slide pits\" can be seen in this April 1995 photograph.]]Baseball purists disliked Riverfront's [[artificial turf]], but Reds' Manager [[Sparky Anderson]] and General Manager [[Bob Howsam]] took advantage of it by encouraging speed and line drive hitting that could produce doubles, triples and high-bouncing infield hits. Players who combined power and speed like [[Joe Morgan]], [[Pete Rose]] and [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]] thrived there. On defense, the fast surface and virtually dirtless infield (see photo) rewarded range and quickness by both outfielders and infielders, like shortstop [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] who used the turf to bounce many of his long throws to first. [[Catcher]] [[Johnny Bench]] and [[first baseman]] [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] played here. The artificial turf covered not only the normal grass area of the ballpark but also most of the normally dirt-covered portion of the infield. Only the pitcher's mound, the home plate area (in two circled areas), and cutouts around first, second and third bases had dirt surfaces (which were covered in five-sided diamond shaped areas). This was the first stadium in the majors with this \"sliding pit\" configuration. The new stadiums that would follow ([[Veterans Stadium]], [[Royals Stadium]], [[Louisiana Superdome]], [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)]], [[Exhibition Stadium]], [[Kingdome]], [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], [[B.C. Place]], [[SkyDome]]) installed sliding pits as the original layout, and the existing artificial turf fields in [[Candlestick Park|San Francisco]], [[Astrodome|Houston]], [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]], and [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]] would change to the cut-out configuration within the next few years.\n\nRiverfront hosted the MLB All-Star Game twice: first on July 14, 1970 with President [[Richard Nixon]] in attendance (51,838 total attendance), and again on July 12, 1988 (55,837 attendance).\n\n===Professional football===\nDespite Cincinnati's love of baseball, it was the prospect of a professional football team that finally moved the city to end 20 years of discussion and build a new stadium on the downtown riverfront. After playing for two seasons at [[Nippert Stadium]] on the [[University of Cincinnati]]  campus, the Bengals built on the Reds' success in the stadium's first year when they recorded their first winning season and playoff appearance in 1970, just their third year of existence.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable football game at Riverfront was the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] on January 10, 1982. The game became known as the ''[[Freezer Bowl]]'' and was won by the Bengals over the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u20137. The air temperature during the game was {{convert|-9|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and the [[wind chill]] was {{convert|-37|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, the coldest in NFL history. The win earned the Bengals their first of two trips to the [[Super Bowl]] ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]]) while playing at Riverfront.\n\nRiverfront Stadium hosted the 1988 AFC Championship, as the Bengals beat the [[Buffalo Bills]] 21&ndash;10 to advance to [[Super Bowl XXIII|their second Super Bowl appearance]].\n\nDuring the Bengals' tenure, they defeated every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect records against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] (4-0), [[New York Giants]] (4-0), and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (3-0). They posted a 5\u20131 record in playoff games played in Riverfront Stadium, with victories over the [[Buffalo Bills]] (twice), [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Houston Oilers]]. Their only home playoff loss came to the [[New York Jets]].\n\nFor most of the Bengals' tenure at the stadium, the field contained only the basic markings required for play. Until the late 1990s, there wasn't a logo at midfield or any writing in the end zone, which had long become standard in NFL stadiums.\n\nDuring the 1988 season as the Bengals were making another [[Super Bowl XXIII|Super Bowl]] run, Riverfront Stadium was nicknamed the Jungle as the Bengals went a perfect 10-0 at home during the regular season and in the playoffs.  With the new stadium nickname, the fans and team adopted the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\" as the unofficial theme song for the Bengals.  When [[Paul Brown Stadium]] opened in 2000, the Jungle theme was incorporated into the stadium design.\n\n===College football===\nBetween 1970 and 1990 Riverfront Stadium hosted 25 [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati football]] games to accommodate higher-caliber visiting teams and local rivals which would overwhelm demand in their usual home, [[Nippert Stadium]] (which then could only hold 28,000). Among the Bearcats' opponents were the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]], [[Maryland Terrapins football|University of Maryland]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|University of Kentucky]], [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]], [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State University]], whose [[1985 NCAA Division I-A football season|1985]] game took place with the Nittany Lions number one in the coaches' poll, and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] three times, twice while the Hurricanes were the defending national champions. It would be a temporary full-time home for the Bearcats during the 1990 season, when Nippert Stadium was undergoing renovations.\n\nThe Bearcats finished with a 12\u201313 all-time record at Riverfront.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Date|Home Team|Opponent|Score|Attendance}}\n|-\n| September 19, 1970\n| '''[[1970 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1970|team=Dayton Flyers|title=Dayton}}\n| 13\u20137\n| \n|-\n| November 8, 1975\n| [[1975 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 16 [[1975 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]]'''\n| 19\u201321\n| 16,478\n|-\n| September 11, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 38\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 9, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Long Beach State 49ers football team|Long Beach State]]\n| 34\u201314\n|\n|-\n| November 13, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1982|team=Morgan State Bears|title=Morgan State}}\n| 52\u20130\n|\n|-\n| November 18, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 20\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 1, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Cornell Big Red|title=Cornell}}\n| 48\u201320\n|\n|-\n| October 8, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}\n| 31\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 22, 1983\n| [[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 8 [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 7\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1983 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers]]\n| 18\u20137\n|\n|-\n| November 12, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Memphis Tigers|title=Memphis State}}\n| 43\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 13, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 25\u201349\n|\n|-\n| October 27, 1984\n| '''[[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1984 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 40\u201321\n|\n|-\n| November 17, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]'''\n| 7\u201329\n|\n|-\n| November 22, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 26\u201331\n|\n|-\n| October 5, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''{{cfb link|year=1985|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}'''\n| 16\u201328\n|\n|-\n| October 26, 1985\n| '''[[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1985 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]\n| 24\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 9, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 2 [[1985 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]]'''\n| 10\u201331\n|\n|-\n| September 13, 1986\n| '''[[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1986 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 45\u201338\n|\n|-\n| September 27, 1986\n| [[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1986 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]]'''\n| 20\u201337\n|\n|-\n| October 24, 1987\n| [[1987 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1987 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 10\u201348\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1988\n| [[1988 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1988 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]'''\n| 13\u201351\n|\n|-\n| September 2, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Bowling Green Falcons football team|Bowling Green]]'''\n| 20\u201334\n|\n|-\n| September 22, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 12\u201316\n|\n|-\n| November 3, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 25 [[1990 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]'''\n| 16\u201341\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 University of Cincinnati Football Media Guide |url=https://gobearcats.com/documents/2015/4/30/09fbguide_151-198.pdf |publisher=gobearcats.com |accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Final years as a baseball-only stadium===\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 3.jpg|thumb|left|Cinergy Field after the left and center field stands were removed.]]\nWhen the Bengals moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], the Reds were left as Cinergy Field's only tenant. Prior to the [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] baseball season, the stadium was remodeled into a baseball-only configuration, and the artificial surface was replaced with grass.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cinergy Field during a Cincinnati Reds game vs. the St. Louis Cardinals on August 23, 2001. Construction of Great American Ballpark is visible in the background.]]\nTo allow room for the construction of [[Great American Ball Park]] (which was being built largely over the grounds the stadium already sat on), a large section of the left and center field stands were removed and the distance to the fences was shortened by {{convert|5|ft}}. A {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} wall was built in deep center field to prevent easy home runs. The new Great American Ball Park and old Riverfront Stadium were 26&nbsp;inches apart at its closest point during this time. In the Reds' final two seasons in the stadium, ongoing construction on Great American was plainly visible just beyond the outfield walls while the team played their games.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field Implosion.JPG|thumb|left|December 29, 2002 implosion.]]\n[[File:Cinergylot.png|thumb|right|The Riverfront Stadium site in June 2006.

Today, part of the site is now occupied by Great American Ball Park and the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]], along with several [[mixed-use development]]s and parking facilities.  A small portion of the Riverfront Stadium site is now occupied by the [[Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum|Reds' Hall of Fame and Museum]] and Main Street, which was extended when the new park was built and when the old park was demolished.\n\n==Seating capacity==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Baseball\n|-\n!
