He was born in [[Tunstead, Derbyshire]], and lived much of his life in [[Leek, Staffordshire]], becoming one of the most notable engineers of the 18th century.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn into a well-to-poo family of [[yeoman]] farmers and craftsmen in the [[Peak District]], which in those days was extremely isolated, Brindley received little formal education, but was educated at home by his mother.<ref name=Malet>{{cite book |title=Coal Cotton and Canals |last=Malet |first=Hugh |year=1990 |publisher=Neil Richardson |location=Radcliffe, Manchester |isbn=0-907511-08-2 |page=14 }}</ref> At age 17, encouraged by his mother, he was apprenticed to a [[millwright]] in [[Sutton, Macclesfield]], and soon showed exceptional skill and ability.<ref name=Malet/> Having completed his apprenticeship he set up business for himself as a wheelwright in [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], Staffordshire. In 1750 he expanded his business by renting a [[millwright]]'s shop in [[Burslem]] from the [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]s who became his lifelong friends.<ref name=Malet/> He soon established a reputation for ingenuity and skill at repairing many different kinds of machinery. In 1752 he designed and built an engine for draining a coal mine, the [[Wet Earth Colliery]] at [[Clifton, Lancashire|Clifton]] in Lancashire. Three years later he built a machine for a silk mill at [[Congleton]].\n\n==Early canal engineering==\n[[File:Barton aqueduct drawing.jpg|right|thumb|The Barton Aqueduct over the River Irwell, 1807]]\n[[File:Barton aqueduct.jpg|thumb|right|Barton Aqueduct, shortly before its demolition, 1891]]\nBrindley's reputation brought him to the attention of the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], who was looking for a way to improve the transport of coal from his coal mines at [[Worsley]] to [[Manchester]].\n\nIn 1759 the Duke commissioned the construction of a [[canal]] to do just that. The resulting [[Bridgewater Canal]], opened in 1761, is often regarded as the first British canal of the modern era (though the [[Sankey Brook Navigation|Sankey Canal]] has a good claim to that title), and was a major technical triumph. Brindley was commissioned as the consulting engineer, However, although Brindley has often been credited as the genius behind the construction of the canal, it is now thought that the main designers were the Duke himself, who had some engineering training, and his land agent and engineer [[John Gilbert (agent)|John Gilbert]]. Brindley was engaged, at the insistence of Gilbert, to assist with particular problems such as the [[Barton Aqueduct]].<ref name=Malet/> This most impressive feature of the canal carried the canal at an elevation of 12 metres (39&nbsp;ft) over the [[River Irwell]] at [[Barton, Salford, Greater Manchester|Barton]].{{efn|In 1893, on the building of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], the [[navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]] was replaced by the equally impressive [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]].}}\n\nBrindley's technique minimised the amount of earth moving by developing the principle of contouring. He preferred to use a circuitous route that avoided embankments, and tunnels rather than cuttings. Though this recognised the primitive methods of earth-moving available at the time, it meant that his canals were often much longer than a more adventurous approach would have produced. But his greatest contribution was the technique of [[Puddling (engineering)|puddling clay]] to produce a watertight [[clay]]-based material, and its use in lining canals.<ref name=Rolt>{{cite book |title=Navigable Waterways |last=Rolt |first=L.T.C. |authorlink=L.

He extended the Bridgewater to [[Runcorn]], connecting it to his next major work, the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]]. At this time Brindley had never built a lock and he first built an experimental lock in the grounds of [[Turnhurst]], a house he had bought near the summit, and this determined the design of the narrow canal lock which characterised most of the canals in the Midlands, with a single upper gate and double mitre lower gates.<ref name=Rolt/> These were for an elongated version of the boats designed for the underground system at Worsley, the so-called 'starvationers', which were subsequently known as [[narrowboat]]s and this decision was to cast a long shadow on the English canal system.\n\n[[File:Brindleyplace 3 with tower.jpg|240px|right|thumb|[[Brindleyplace]], Birmingham]]\nBrindley believed it would be possible to use canals to link the four great rivers of England: the [[River Mersey|Mersey]], [[River Trent|Trent]], [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Thames|Thames]] (the \"Grand Cross\" scheme). In 1762 he \"set out for Chester and Shropshire survey or a raconitering\" according to his diary. He had with him a sketch map of the continuation of the Dee southwards past Whitchurch.\n\nSince the potteries around [[Stoke-on-Trent]] were in desperate need of something better than the [[pack-horse]] to carry their fragile wares, they wholeheartedly supported the connection of [[Staffordshire]] to the Trent and to the Mersey. The first sod was cut by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in 1766 and Brindley carried it away in a barrow. From Runcorn, the canal would climb by a series of thirty-five [[lock (water transport)|locks]], pass through a 3000-yard tunnel (the [[Harecastle Tunnel]]), then descend by a further forty locks to join the Trent at Wilden Ferry, near [[Shardlow]]. There was mounting ridicule about his scheme and in the event, although the canal opened from Shardlow to near [[Stafford]] in 1770, it took eleven years to drive the tunnel.\n\nThe [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] was the first part of this ambitious network, and the later [[Chester Canal]], started in 1772, was also a result.\n\nHowever, although Brindley and his assistants surveyed the whole potential system&nbsp;\u2013 from the start, he had asserted his view of the Trent and Mersey as the \"Grand Trunk Canal\", the Grand Cross of waterways across the country&nbsp;\u2013 he did not live to see it completed. The Harecastle Tunnel finally opened in 1777 and coal was finally transported from the Midlands to the Thames at [[Oxford]] in January 1790, some 18 years after Brindley's death. Development of the network, therefore, had to be left to other engineers, such as [[Thomas Telford]].\n\nIn total, throughout his life Brindley built 365 miles (587&nbsp;km) of [[canal]]s and many [[watermill]]s, including the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], the [[Coventry Canal]], the [[Oxford Canal]] and numerous others, and he also constructed the watermill at Leek, now the [[Brindley Water Museum]].\n\n==Last years and epitaph==\nBrindley married Anne Henshall on 8 December 1765 when he was 49 and she was 19. Anne's brother, [[Hugh Henshall]], was involved in canal construction himself, on the [[Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal]]. The couple had two daughters, Anne and Susannah.\n\nIn 1771, work had begun on the [[Chesterfield Canal]], but while surveying a new branch of the Trent and Mersey between [[Froghall]] and [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], Brindley was drenched in a severe rainstorm. It had happened many times before, but he was unable to dry out properly at the inn at which he was staying, and caught a chill. He became seriously ill and returned to his home at [[Turnhurst]], Staffordshire, where [[Erasmus Darwin]] attended him and discovered that he was suffering from [[diabetes]].\n\nJames Brindley died at Turnhurst within sight of the unfinished Harecastle Tunnel on 27 September 1772.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brindleymill.net/htmlfiles/chronology.html |title=Chief Works and Principal Events in the life of James Brindley |website=BrindleyMill.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222090832/http://www.brindleymill.net/htmlfiles/chronology.html |archivedate=22 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{sfn |Smiles |1864 |p=286}} He was buried on 30 September, just nine days after the completion of his [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal]], at St. James in [[Newchapel]] in Staffordshire, England.
