{"title_page": "List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nSeveral fields of human cultural and scientific development are not included in the list of [[Nobel Prize]]s, because they are either not among the prizes established as part of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s will nor, in the case of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], sponsored afterwards by the [[Nobel Foundation]]. While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with founding year in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize|Kavli Prize in Astrophysics]] (2008)<ref name=kavli1>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=ucsc.edu|date=27 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=kavli2>{{cite web|author=Ham Chau|url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists|website=English.vietnamnet.vn|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Gruber Prize in Cosmology]] (2000)<ref name=gruber1>{{cite web|url=https://science.tamu.edu/news/2007/07/texas-am-physicist-shares-in-500000-gruber-cosmology-prize/|title=Texas A&M Physicist Shares in $500,000 Gruber Cosmology Prize|website=tamu.edu|date=17 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\n* [[Marconi Prize]] (1975)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1110|title=2011 Marconi Society Symposium Comes to UC San Diego|website=ucsd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/nri-scientist-aj-paulraj-wins-tech-nobel-2014-marconi-prize/articleshow/29232251.cms|title=NRI scientist AJ Paulraj wins tech 'Nobel'- 2014 Marconi Prize|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=23 January 2014|last1=Rajghatta|first1=Chidanand}}</ref><ref name=turing/>\n\n====Computer science====\n* [[Turing Award]] (1966)<ref name=turing/><ref name=turing2007/><ref name=turing2014/>\n* [[IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzuAjubj90AC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=IEEE+John+von+Neumann+Medal+nobel+prize&source=bl&ots=rkYiZscjCW&sig=ACfU3U1JW9v2542rlwu9faU5zevkYsPqQw&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=IEEE%20John%20von%20Neumann%20Medal%20nobel%20prize&f=false|last1=Berntsen|first1=Drude|last2=Elgsaas|first2=Knut|last3=Hegna|first3=H\u00e5vard|editor-last=Tatnall|editor-first=Arthur|title=History of Computing: Learning from the Past|publisher=Springer |date=2010|pages=46|chapter=The Many Dimensions of Kristen Nygaard, Creator of Object-Oriented Programming and the Scandinavian School of System Development|isbn=978-3-642-15198-9|via=Google Books|chapterurl=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01059591/document|quote=it was in recognition of work that clearly was of Nobel laureate stature}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_isnt_there_a_Nobel_Prize_for_Computer_Scientists_Instead_of_the_one_for_economists|title=Why isn't there a Nobel Prize for Computer Scientists?|website=researchgate.net|date=April 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Computer Pioneer Award]] (1981)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/good-reasons/our-renowned-professors/|title=Our Renowned Professors|website=tum.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/volunteering/boards-and-committees/resources/policies-procedures-manual/section12|title=IEEE Computer Society Awards|website=computer.org|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Nevanlinna Prize|IMU Abacus Medal]] (1982)<sup>2</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/imu-abacus-medal/|author=Katie Steckles|date=23 May 2019|title=IMU Abacus Medal|website=spektrum.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/who-was-nevanlinna-and-what-is-his-prize/|author=John Cook|date=22 September 2013|title=Who was Nevanlinna and what is his prize?|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yale.edu/2010/08/19/yale-computer-scientist-wins-prestigious-nevanlinna-prize|date=19 August 2010|title=Yale Computer Scientist Wins Prestigious Nevanlinna Prize|website=yale.edu}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n* 1: The Computer Pioneer Award recognizes significant contributions to concepts and developments in the electronic computer field which have clearly advanced the state of the art in computing.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation.
