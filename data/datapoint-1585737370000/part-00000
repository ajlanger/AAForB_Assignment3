She, along with [[Rajesh Khanna]] was chosen as finalist and both were presented on stage as winners at the Filmfare Awards function. She got her first film offer for ''Taqdeer'' from [[Tarachand Barjatya]] who happened to be in the audience.<ref name=\"Farida Jalal \u2013 Interview 2000\">[http://cineplot.com/farida-jalal-interview-2000/ Farida Jalal \u2013 Interview (2000)], \"Cineplot.com\"</ref> In an interview in 2014, she said, when asked her about initial part of her career: \"I started my acting career when I was just out of my school St Joseph's Convent in Panchgani, in a film called ''Taqdeer''. I took part in a talent contest and even won. Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and I were the finalists. How was I to know that I'd soon be doing a film ''Aradhana'' with him?\".<ref name=\"2014 interview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/features/type/view/id/7616|title=\"I virtually grew up and grew old in the industry\" \u2013 Farida Jalal|last=Ethiraj|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nShe usually played the sister or rejected fianc\u00e9e of the male lead, but almost never the female lead. One of her most critically acclaimed roles is in ''[[Bobby (1973 film)|Bobby]]'', where she played the part of the [[mental retardation|mentally challenged]] would-be fianc\u00e9e of [[Rishi Kapoor]]. During the 1980s, her roles progressed from sister and girlfriend to aunt, mother, or grandmother. She is also remembered for her part in ''Aradhana'', in which she plays [[Rajesh Khanna]]'s girlfriend, and sings the song \"Bagon me bahar hai, kaliyon pe nikhar hai\".\n\nWhen asked as to how she started getting typecast as a hero's sister, she quoted in an interview: \"It all started with ''Gopi'' where I was offered the greatest mr Dilip Kumar's sister's role. Forget about refusing, I jumped at the offer. Even if I had the chance to just go and observe him on the set I'd have done it. I love the man. I remember during those days each and every actor was copying Dilip Saab whether it was Dharmendra, Jeetendra or Manoj Kumar. I was much in-demand as Dilip Saab's sister. Every hero wanted the same. Every actor wanted me to play his sister. Sometimes the sister was the film's heroine. The official heroine would just sing her songs, whereas I had all the dramatic scenes. I got my recognition and the awards. In a film called ''Paras'' I was Sanjeev Kumar's sister. But I had a lot more to do than Raakhee-di who played the heroine. I got my first award for it. Then I got my second award for ''Majboor'', a film written by Salimbhai and Javedbhai where Bachchan Saab played my brother. It was so heartening. Why would I want to be heroine when I was getting the stronger parts as the sister?\"<ref name=\"2014 interview\" />\n\nShe acted for over 40 years, only taking a break during 1983 and 1990, when she settled in [[Bangalore]].\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jalal had a part in many major hits in India, among them ''[[Raja Hindustani]]'', ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'', ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'', ''[[Kaho Naa...

She acted in many television serials, such as the hit sitcom ''Dekh Bahi Dekh''.\n\nShe was grandly acclaimed for her role in the 1994 film ''[[Mammo]]'', for which she received the Filmfare Best Performance Award. Earlier, she was also nominated multiple times for 'Best Supporting Actress Award', one for the Amitabh Bachchan-Parveen Babi-Pran starrer ''Majboor'' where she played Amitabh's handicapped sister.\n\nFarida Jalal though, could not get a major break as heroine against any big star except Rajesh Khanna in ''Aaradhana'', but she played the lead role in ''Jeevan Rekha'' in which her husband Tabrez was the hero. Pran and Ajit were also in the film. A song of the film; \"Yaar mere, meri baahon me aaja\" by [[Mohammed Rafi]] from this film had become popular, and is still popular.\n\nJalal starred in ''Shararat (Thoda Jadu, Thodi Nazaakat)'', in which she played a leading role. The comedy is currently airing on the [[Disney Channel]].\n\nIn 2005, she co-hosted the 50th [[Filmfare Awards]] alongside [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Sonali Bendre]], in Mumbai.

She, along with [[Rajesh Khanna]] was chosen as finalist and both were presented on stage as winners at the Filmfare Awards function. She got her first film offer for ''Taqdeer'' from [[Tarachand Barjatya]] who happened to be in the audience.<ref name=\"Farida Jalal \u2013 Interview 2000\">[http://cineplot.com/farida-jalal-interview-2000/ Farida Jalal \u2013 Interview (2000)], \"Cineplot.com\"</ref> In an interview in 2014, she said, when asked her about initial part of her career: \"I started my acting career when I was just out of my school St Joseph's Convent in Panchgani, in a film called ''Taqdeer''. I took part in a talent contest and even won. Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and I were the finalists. How was I to know that I'd soon be doing a film ''Aradhana'' with him?\".<ref name=\"2014 interview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/features/type/view/id/7616|title=\"I virtually grew up and grew old in the industry\" \u2013 Farida Jalal|last=Ethiraj|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nShe usually played the sister or rejected fianc\u00e9e of the male lead, but almost never the female lead. One of her most critically acclaimed roles is in ''[[Bobby (1973 film)|Bobby]]'', where she played the part of the [[mental retardation|mentally challenged]] would-be fianc\u00e9e of [[Rishi Kapoor]]. During the 1980s, her roles progressed from sister and girlfriend to aunt, mother, or grandmother. She is also remembered for her part in ''Aradhana'', in which she plays [[Rajesh Khanna]]'s girlfriend, and sings the song \"Bagon me bahar hai, kaliyon pe nikhar hai\".\n\nWhen asked as to how she started getting typecast as a hero's sister, she quoted in an interview: \"It all started with ''Gopi'' where I was offered the greatest mr Dilip Kumar's sister's role. Forget about refusing, I jumped at the offer. Even if I had the chance to just go and observe him on the set I'd have done it. I love the man. I remember during those days each and every actor was copying Dilip Saab whether it was Dharmendra, Jeetendra or Manoj Kumar. I was much in-demand as Dilip Saab's sister. Every hero wanted the same. Every actor wanted me to play his sister. Sometimes the sister was the film's heroine. The official heroine would just sing her songs, whereas I had all the dramatic scenes. I got my recognition and the awards. In a film called ''Paras'' I was Sanjeev Kumar's sister. But I had a lot more to do than Raakhee-di who played the heroine. I got my first award for it. Then I got my second award for ''Majboor'', a film written by Salimbhai and Javedbhai where Bachchan Saab played my brother. It was so heartening. Why would I want to be heroine when I was getting the stronger parts as the sister?\"<ref name=\"2014 interview\" />\n\nShe acted for over 40 years, only taking a break during 1983 and 1990, when she settled in [[Bangalore]].\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jalal had a part in many major hits in India, among them ''[[Raja Hindustani]]'', ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'', ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'', ''[[Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai]]'', ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' and ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'', for which she won a [[Filmfare Award]] for [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] in 1995. Farida Jalal played the lead in the film ''Mammo''. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Jalal won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance. She acted in many television serials, such as the hit sitcom ''Dekh Bahi Dekh''.\n\nShe was grandly acclaimed for her role in the 1994 film ''[[Mammo]]'', for which she received the Filmfare Best Performance Award. Earlier, she was also nominated multiple times for 'Best Supporting Actress Award', one for the Amitabh Bachchan-Parveen Babi-Pran starrer ''Majboor'' where she played Amitabh's handicapped sister.\n\nFarida Jalal though, could not get a major break as heroine against any big star except Rajesh Khanna in ''Aaradhana'', but she played the lead role in ''Jeevan Rekha'' in which her husband Tabrez was the hero. Pran and Ajit were also in the film. A song of the film; \"Yaar mere, meri baahon me aaja\" by [[Mohammed Rafi]] from this film had become popular, and is still popular.\n\nJalal starred in ''Shararat (Thoda Jadu, Thodi Nazaakat)'', in which she played a leading role. The comedy is currently airing on the [[Disney Channel]].\n\nIn 2005, she co-hosted the 50th [[Filmfare Awards]] alongside [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Sonali Bendre]], in Mumbai. In 2008, she made a special appearance in the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] film ''[[Yaariyan (2008 film)|Yaariyan]]''.
