This extra chromosome directly affects sexual development before birth and during puberty (links to learning disabilities and speech development have also been shown to be affected). There are varieties in Klinefelter Syndrome, where some cases may have the extra X chromosome in some cells but not others, referred to as Mosaic Klinefelter Syndrome, or where individuals have the extra X chromosome in all cells. The reduction of testosterone in the male body normally results in an overall decrease in the production of viable sperm for these individuals thereby forcing them to turn to fertility treatments to father children.<ref name=\":04\" />\n\n'''<small>Y chromosome deletions</small>'''\n\n[[Y chromosome deletions|Y chromosomal infertility]] is a direct cause of male infertility due to its effects on sperm production, occurring in 1 out of every 2000 males.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/y-chromosome-infertility#inheritance|title=Y chromosome infertility|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Usually affected men show no sign of symptoms other than at times can exhibit smaller teste size.

Typically two separate [[semen analysis|semen analyses]] will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.\n\n===Medical history===\nThe history should include prior testicular or penile insults ([[Testicular torsion|torsion]], [[cryptorchidism]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]]), [[infections]] ([[mumps]] [[orchitis]], [[epididymitis]]), environmental factors, excessive heat, [[radiation]], medications, and drug use ([[anabolic steroids]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[smoking]]).\n\nSexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of [[lubricant]]s, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.\n\nLoss of [[libido]] and [[headaches]] or [[visual disturbances]] may indicate a [[pituitary tumor]].\n\nThe past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), [[diabetic neuropathy]] ([[retrograde ejaculation]]), radical pelvic or [[retroperitoneal]] surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or [[hernia repair]] (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).\n\nA [[family history]] may reveal genetic problems.\n\n===Physical examination===\nUsually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the [[human penis|penis]], [[scrotum]], [[testicles]], I [[vas deferens]], [[spermatic cord]]s, [[ejaculatory ducts]], [[urethra]], [[urinary bladder]], [[anus]] and [[rectum]]. An [[orchidometer]] can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/> A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a [[varicocele]], but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/>\n\n===Sperm sample===\n\n==== Semen sample obtaining ====\nSemen sample obtaining is the first step in spermiogram. The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2\u20137 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa.\n\nA single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. It is prudent to ask about possible sample loss, as that could mask true results of spermiogram.\n\nTo obtain the sample, a sterile plastic recipient is put directly inside, always no more than one hour before being studied. Conventional preservatives shouldn't be used, as they have chemical substances as lubricants or spermicides that could damage the sample. If preservatives have to be used, for cases of religious ethics in which masturbation is forbidden, a preservative with holes is used. In case of paraplegia it is possible to use mechanic tools or [[electroejaculation]].\n\nThe sample should never be obtained through coitus interruptus for several reasons:\n\n*Some part of ejaculation could be lost.\n*Bacterial contamination could happen.\n*The acid vaginal pH could be deleterious for sperm motility.\n\nAlso is very important to label the sample correctly the recipient with patient identification, date, hour, abstinence days, among other data required to be known.\n\n{{Main|Semen analysis}}\n{{Further|Semen quality}}\nThe volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured.

This extra chromosome directly affects sexual development before birth and during puberty (links to learning disabilities and speech development have also been shown to be affected). There are varieties in Klinefelter Syndrome, where some cases may have the extra X chromosome in some cells but not others, referred to as Mosaic Klinefelter Syndrome, or where individuals have the extra X chromosome in all cells. The reduction of testosterone in the male body normally results in an overall decrease in the production of viable sperm for these individuals thereby forcing them to turn to fertility treatments to father children.<ref name=\":04\" />\n\n'''<small>Y chromosome deletions</small>'''\n\n[[Y chromosome deletions|Y chromosomal infertility]] is a direct cause of male infertility due to its effects on sperm production, occurring in 1 out of every 2000 males.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/y-chromosome-infertility#inheritance|title=Y chromosome infertility|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Usually affected men show no sign of symptoms other than at times can exhibit smaller teste size.

Typically two separate [[semen analysis|semen analyses]] will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.\n\n===Medical history===\nThe history should include prior testicular or penile insults ([[Testicular torsion|torsion]], [[cryptorchidism]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]]), [[infections]] ([[mumps]] [[orchitis]], [[epididymitis]]), environmental factors, excessive heat, [[radiation]], medications, and drug use ([[anabolic steroids]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[smoking]]).\n\nSexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of [[lubricant]]s, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.\n\nLoss of [[libido]] and [[headaches]] or [[visual disturbances]] may indicate a [[pituitary tumor]].\n\nThe past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), [[diabetic neuropathy]] ([[retrograde ejaculation]]), radical pelvic or [[retroperitoneal]] surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or [[hernia repair]] (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).\n\nA [[family history]] may reveal genetic problems.\n\n===Physical examination===\nUsually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the [[human penis|penis]], [[scrotum]], [[testicles]], I [[vas deferens]], [[spermatic cord]]s, [[ejaculatory ducts]], [[urethra]], [[urinary bladder]], [[anus]] and [[rectum]]. An [[orchidometer]] can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/> A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a [[varicocele]], but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated.<ref name=\"LottiMaggi2014\"/>\n\n===Sperm sample===\n\n==== Semen sample obtaining ====\nSemen sample obtaining is the first step in spermiogram. The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2\u20137 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa.\n\nA single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. It is prudent to ask about possible sample loss, as that could mask true results of spermiogram.\n\nTo obtain the sample, a sterile plastic recipient is put directly inside, always no more than one hour before being studied. Conventional preservatives shouldn't be used, as they have chemical substances as lubricants or spermicides that could damage the sample. If preservatives have to be used, for cases of religious ethics in which masturbation is forbidden, a preservative with holes is used. In case of paraplegia it is possible to use mechanic tools or [[electroejaculation]].\n\nThe sample should never be obtained through coitus interruptus for several reasons:\n\n*Some part of ejaculation could be lost.\n*Bacterial contamination could happen.\n*The acid vaginal pH could be deleterious for sperm motility.\n\nAlso is very important to label the sample correctly the recipient with patient identification, date, hour, abstinence days, among other data required to be known.\n\n{{Main|Semen analysis}}\n{{Further|Semen quality}}\nThe volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured.

In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study.<ref name=\"pmid28333357\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Salas-Huetos A, Bull\u00f3 M, Salas-Salvad\u00f3 J | title = Dietary patterns, foods and nutrients in male fertility parameters and fecundability: a systematic review of observational studies | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 371\u2013389 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28333357 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmx006 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male's fertility.
