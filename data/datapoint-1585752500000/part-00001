Colloquially, the term also denotes the pedestrian, bicycle, and rollerblading pathway on the [[seawall]], one which has been extended far outside the boundaries of Stanley Park and which has become one of the most-used features of the park by both locals and tourists. James \"Jimmy\" Cunningham, a master mason, dedicated his life to the construction of the seawall from 1931 until his retirement. Even after he retired, Cunningham continued to return to monitor the wall's progress, until his death at 85. While the whole path is not built upon the seawall; the total distance from CRAB park, around [[Stanley Park]] and [[False Creek]] to [[Spanish Banks]] is about {{convert|30|km}}.\n\nDespite perennial conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and inline skaters, park users consider the seawall to be the most important feature of Stanley Park and it is the most used feature within the park.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Belyea| first =Ross|author2=Marc St. Louis  | title = The Stanley Park Technical Report| publisher =Stanley Park Task Force, prepared by Belyea, Sorensen & Associates| date =21 January 1992| location =Vancouver| page =15}}</ref><ref name=\"Stanley Park Task Force 30\u201334\">{{Cite book| last =Stanley Park Task Force| title =Stanley Park Task Force Final Report| publisher =Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation| date =22 May 1992| location =Vancouver| pages =30\u201334}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe original idea for the seawall is attributed to park board superintendent, W.

It was argued that the waves created by ships passing through the First Narrows were eroding the area between Prospect Point and Brockton Point.

The proposal triggered an outcry from [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] groups, such as the Save Our Parkland Association.

The popularity of inline skating in the 1990s also contributed to the debate over seawall use, as well as skateboarders to a lesser extent, until users were divided into wheeled versus non-wheeled camps.
