When the then-Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz bin Baz issued a [[fatwa]] lending Islamic justification for the regime to invite American forces to defend Saudi Arabia from Hussein, al-Ouda raised questions about the ability of the Saudi military to defend the Kingdom with so much investment in U.S. armaments. During the war, al-Ouda was a moving force behind two reform petitions addressed to the King. The first, in 1991, was known as the Letter of Demands and was signed by leading Saudi religious, mercantile, and socially prominent figures seeking changes in the form of government, notably the establishment of a Shura (consultative) Council. A year later, the second petition, known as the Memorandum of Advice, which was signed by more than one hundred religious scholars, including establishment Ulama, called for a Shura Council as well as media censorship under religious guidance and review of all the kingdom's laws to insure their conformity with Shari'a. Both petitions expressed loyalty to the house of Sa'ud while opposing the lack of representation in the existing government. Meanwhile, audiotapes of al-Ouda's sermons gained wide circulation and encouraged to other opposition voices after the first Gulf War, as the United States military settled in for a long stay at an airbase outside the capital.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\"/>\n\nAl-Ouda was one of the leaders of the [[Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights]] (CDLR) that was a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] dissident group created in 1993 and was the first ever opposition organization in the Kingdom openly challenging the absolute monarchy, accusing the government and senior Saudi scholars of not doing enough to protect the legitimate Islamic rights of the Muslims.<ref name=\"CDLR_Kapisz\" />\n\nIn September 1994 Salman al-Ouda was imprisoned for alleged \"anti-government activities.\" He and [[Safar al-Hawali]] were arrested together with a large number of their followers in the city of [[Buraidah|Burayda]], [[Al Qassim Province|Qasim]] region. Moreover, Sheikh [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz|Abd al-Aziz Ibn Baz]] issued a fatwa, that unless al-Ouda and al-Hawali repented their former conduct, they would be banned from lecturing, meetings and cassette-recording.\n\nFollowing his five years of imprisonment for having incited opposition to the Saudi government, al-Ouda emerged \"rehabilitated\" in 1999 to become one of the kingdom's most prominent religious spokespersons. With a television program and a website in four languages, he was viewed in 2007 as a supporter of the Saudi government, operating under its protection and in competition with the government-sponsored establishment Ulama (clergy).<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\" />\n\nHe was an advocate for [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|Sunni-Shia dialogue]],<ref name=\"economist_appeal_mercy\" >{{cite news |author= |title=A Muslim appeal for Saudi Arabia to show mercy |url=https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/06/02/a-muslim-appeal-for-saudi-arabia-to-show-mercy |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 June 2019}}</ref> calling for a more inclusive society that would end the marginalization of Saudi Shia citizens.

He gave daily lessons after the Morning Prayer, where he talked about the authoritative collections of Hadith - Sah\u00eeh al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee, Sah\u00eeh Muslim and discussed the Qur'an. He described the content of the books Kit\u00e2b al-Tawh\u00eed, al-Us\u00fbl al-Thal\u00e2thah, and Nukhbah al-Fikr. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf Crisis]] and War, in which an American-led coalition of forces aligned against the Iraqi regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] in response to its seizure of [[Kuwait]], proved an opportunity for al-Ouda and others to tap into an already-existing current of discontent within the Kingdom. When the then-Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz bin Baz issued a [[fatwa]] lending Islamic justification for the regime to invite American forces to defend Saudi Arabia from Hussein, al-Ouda raised questions about the ability of the Saudi military to defend the Kingdom with so much investment in U.S. armaments. During the war, al-Ouda was a moving force behind two reform petitions addressed to the King. The first, in 1991, was known as the Letter of Demands and was signed by leading Saudi religious, mercantile, and socially prominent figures seeking changes in the form of government, notably the establishment of a Shura (consultative) Council. A year later, the second petition, known as the Memorandum of Advice, which was signed by more than one hundred religious scholars, including establishment Ulama, called for a Shura Council as well as media censorship under religious guidance and review of all the kingdom's laws to insure their conformity with Shari'a. Both petitions expressed loyalty to the house of Sa'ud while opposing the lack of representation in the existing government. Meanwhile, audiotapes of al-Ouda's sermons gained wide circulation and encouraged to other opposition voices after the first Gulf War, as the United States military settled in for a long stay at an airbase outside the capital.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\"/>\n\nAl-Ouda was one of the leaders of the [[Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights]] (CDLR) that was a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] dissident group created in 1993 and was the first ever opposition organization in the Kingdom openly challenging the absolute monarchy, accusing the government and senior Saudi scholars of not doing enough to protect the legitimate Islamic rights of the Muslims.<ref name=\"CDLR_Kapisz\" />\n\nIn September 1994 Salman al-Ouda was imprisoned for alleged \"anti-government activities.\" He and [[Safar al-Hawali]] were arrested together with a large number of their followers in the city of [[Buraidah|Burayda]], [[Al Qassim Province|Qasim]] region. Moreover, Sheikh [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz|Abd al-Aziz Ibn Baz]] issued a fatwa, that unless al-Ouda and al-Hawali repented their former conduct, they would be banned from lecturing, meetings and cassette-recording.\n\nFollowing his five years of imprisonment for having incited opposition to the Saudi government, al-Ouda emerged \"rehabilitated\" in 1999 to become one of the kingdom's most prominent religious spokespersons. With a television program and a website in four languages, he was viewed in 2007 as a supporter of the Saudi government, operating under its protection and in competition with the government-sponsored establishment Ulama (clergy).<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\" />\n\nHe was an advocate for [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|Sunni-Shia dialogue]],<ref name=\"economist_appeal_mercy\" >{{cite news |author= |title=A Muslim appeal for Saudi Arabia to show mercy |url=https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/06/02/a-muslim-appeal-for-saudi-arabia-to-show-mercy |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 June 2019}}</ref> calling for a more inclusive society that would end the marginalization of Saudi Shia citizens.
