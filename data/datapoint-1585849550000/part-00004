It sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of [[intellectual property]] (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations.<ref>See TRIPS Art. 1(3).</ref> TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) between 1989 and 1990<ref>{{Cite book|title=The TRIPS Agreement: Negotiating History|last=Gervais|first=Daniel|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=Part I.}}</ref> and is administered by the WTO.\n\nThe TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the multilateral trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the [[Doha Declaration]]. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal \"to promote access to medicines for all.\"\n\nSpecifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide [[copyright]] rights, covering authors and other copyright holders, as well as holders of related rights, namely performers, sound recording producers and broadcasting organisations; [[geographical indication]]s; [[Industrial design law|industrial designs]]; [[mask work|integrated circuit layout-designs]]; [[patent]]s;  [[plant breeders' rights|new plant varieties]]; [[trademark]]s; [[Trade name|trade names]] and undisclosed or [[confidential information]]. TRIPS also specifies [[enforcement]] procedures, remedies, and [[dispute resolution]] procedures. Protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.\n\n==Background and history==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2012}}\nTRIPS was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1986-1994.   Its inclusion was the culmination of a program of intense [[lobbying]] by the [[United States]], supported by the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and other [[developed nations]].  Campaigns of unilateral economic encouragement under the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] and [[Economic coercion|coercion]] under [[Section 301]] of the Trade Act played an important role in defeating competing policy positions that were favored by developing countries like Brazil, but also including Thailand, India and Caribbean Basin states.  In turn, the United States strategy of linking trade policy to intellectual property standards can be traced back to the entrepreneurship of senior management at [[Pfizer]] in the early 1980s, who mobilized corporations in the United States and made maximizing intellectual property privileges the number one priority of trade policy in the United States (Braithwaite and Drahos, 2000, Chapter 7).\n\nAfter the Uruguay round, the GATT became the basis for the establishment of the World Trade Organization.  Because ratification of TRIPS is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organization membership, any country seeking to obtain hard access to the numerous international markets opened by the World Trade Organization must enact the strict intellectual property laws mandated by TRIPS.  For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws.  States like Russia and [[China]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Farah, Paolo Davide|author2=Cima, Elena|date=2010|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1527992|title=China\u2019s Participation in the World Trade Organization: Trade in Goods, Services, Intellectual Property Rights and Transparency Issues\" in Aurelio Lopez-Tarruella Martinez (ed.), El comercio con China.

States can be disciplined through the WTO's [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|dispute settlement]] mechanism.\n\n==Requirements==\nTRIPS requires member states to provide strong protection for intellectual property rights. For example, under TRIPS:\n\n* Copyright terms must extend at least 50 years, unless based on the life of the [[author]]. (Art. 12 and 14)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) - agreement text - standards |publisher=WTO |date=1994-04-15 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>\n* Copyright must be granted automatically, and not based upon any \"[[copyright formalities|formality]]\", such as [[copyright registration|registrations]], as specified in the [[Berne Convention]]. (Art. 9)\n* Computer programs must be regarded as \"literary works\" under copyright law and receive the same terms of protection.\n* National [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|exceptions to copyright]] (such as \"[[fair use]]\" in the United States) are constrained by the [[Berne three-step test]]\n* Patents must be granted for \"inventions\" in all \"fields of technology\" provided they meet all other patentability requirements (although exceptions for certain public interests are allowed (Art. 27.2 and 27.3)<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part II \u2014 Standards concerning the availability, scope and use of Intellectual Property Rights; Sections 5 and 6\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm}}</ref> and must be enforceable for at least 20 years (Art 33).\n* Exceptions to exclusive rights must be limited, provided that a normal exploitation of the work (Art.&nbsp;13) and normal exploitation of the patent (Art&nbsp;30) is not in conflict.\n* No unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the right holders of computer programs and patents is allowed.\n* Legitimate interests of third parties have to be taken into account by patent rights (Art&nbsp;30).\n* In each state, intellectual property laws may not offer any benefits to local citizens which are not available to citizens of other TRIPS signatories under the principle of [[national treatment]] (with certain limited exceptions, Art. 3 and 5).<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part I \u2014 General Provisions and Basic Principles\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_03_e.htm}}</ref>  TRIPS also has a [[most favored nation clause]].\n\nThe TRIPS Agreement incorporates by reference the provisions on copyright from the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] (Art 9), with the exception of moral rights. It also incorporated by reference the substantive provisions of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (Art 2.1). The TRIPS Agreement specifically mentions that software and databases are protected by copyright, subject to originality requirement (Art 10).\n\nArticle 10 of the Agreement stipulates:\n\"1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).\n2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.\"\n\n===Access to essential medicines===<!-- This section is linked from [[Patent]] -->\nThe most visible conflict has been over [[AIDS]] drugs in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]].  Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs  for public health programs across Africa, this controversy has not led to a revision of TRIPS. Instead, an interpretive statement, the [[Doha Declaration]], was issued in November 2001, which indicated that TRIPS should not prevent states from dealing with public health crises.  After Doha, [[PhRMA]], the United States and to a lesser extent other developed nations began working to minimize the effect of the declaration.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Timmermann, Cristian|author2=Henk van den Belt|date=2013|title=Intellectual property and global health: from corporate social responsibility to the access to knowledge movement|journal=Liverpool Law Review|volume=34 (1)|pages=47-73}}</ref>\n\nA 2003 agreement loosened the domestic market requirement, and allows developing countries to export to other countries where there is a national health problem as long as drugs exported are not part of a commercial or industrial policy.<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health\n|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/implem_para6_e.htm\n|date=1 September 2003\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization}}</ref> Drugs exported under such a regime may be packaged or colored differently in order to prevent them from prejudicing markets in the developed world.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration also changed its position, concluding that generic treatments might in fact be a component of an effective strategy to combat HIV.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin, \u201c[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2011_life_cycle-libre.pdf The Life-Cycle of Transnational Issues: Lessons from the Access to Medicines Controversy]\u201d, Global Society 25(2) 2011: 227-247.</ref>  Bush created the [[PEPFAR]] program, which received $15 billion from 2003 to 2007, and was reauthorized in 2008 for $48 billion over the next five years.  Despite wavering on the issue of [compulsory licensing], PEPFAR began to distribute generic drugs in 2004\u20135.\n\n===Software and business method patents===\n{{main article|Software patents under TRIPs Agreement}}\nAnother controversy has been over the TRIPS Article 27 requirements for patentability \"in all fields of technology\", and whether or not this necessitates the granting of [[software patent|software]] and [[business method patent]]s.\n\nAccording to article 10 of the TRIPS Agreement the appropriate instrument to protect software protection is copyright. The importance of this instrument has recently been confirmed by the US Supreme Court (''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'').\n\n== Implementation in developing countries ==\n\nThe obligations under TRIPS apply equally to all member states, however [[developing countries]] were allowed extra time to implement the applicable changes to their national laws, in two tiers of transition according to their level of development.  The transition period for developing countries expired in 2005. The transition period for [[least developed countries]] to implement TRIPS was extended to 2013, and until 1 January 2016 for pharmaceutical patents, with the possibility of further extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/tripfq_e.htm|title=WTO - intellectual property (TRIPS) - frequently-asked questions|website=Wto.org|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt has therefore been argued that the TRIPS standard of requiring all countries to create strict intellectual property systems will be detrimental to poorer countries' development.<ref>{{Citation\n |title       = IP Justice policy paper for the WIPO development agenda\n |publisher   = IP Justice\n |url         = http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130108183327/http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |archivedate = 8 January 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.-F.

Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of [[artificial scarcity]] on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism has focused on the failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries.<ref>Ping Xiong \u2018Patents in TRIPS-Plus Provisions and the Approaches to Interpretation of Free Trade Agreements and TRIPS: Do They Affect Public Health?\u2019 (2012) 46(1) Journal of World Trade 155</ref> Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market.

Despite this recognition, less-developed countries have argued that TRIPS's flexible provisions, such as compulsory licensing, are near-on impossible to exercise.

an [[international agreement|international legal agreement]] between all the member nations of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of [[intellectual property]] (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations.<ref>See TRIPS Art. 1(3).</ref> TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) between 1989 and 1990<ref>{{Cite book|title=The TRIPS Agreement: Negotiating History|last=Gervais|first=Daniel|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=Part I.}}</ref> and is administered by the WTO.\n\nThe TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the multilateral trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the [[Doha Declaration]]. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal \"to promote access to medicines for all.\"\n\nSpecifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide [[copyright]] rights, covering authors and other copyright holders, as well as holders of related rights, namely performers, sound recording producers and broadcasting organisations; [[geographical indication]]s; [[Industrial design law|industrial designs]]; [[mask work|integrated circuit layout-designs]]; [[patent]]s;  [[plant breeders' rights|new plant varieties]]; [[trademark]]s; [[Trade name|trade names]] and undisclosed or [[confidential information]]. TRIPS also specifies [[enforcement]] procedures, remedies, and [[dispute resolution]] procedures. Protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.\n\n==Background and history==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2012}}\nTRIPS was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1986-1994.   Its inclusion was the culmination of a program of intense [[lobbying]] by the [[United States]], supported by the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and other [[developed nations]].  Campaigns of unilateral economic encouragement under the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] and [[Economic coercion|coercion]] under [[Section 301]] of the Trade Act played an important role in defeating competing policy positions that were favored by developing countries like Brazil, but also including Thailand, India and Caribbean Basin states.  In turn, the United States strategy of linking trade policy to intellectual property standards can be traced back to the entrepreneurship of senior management at [[Pfizer]] in the early 1980s, who mobilized corporations in the United States and made maximizing intellectual property privileges the number one priority of trade policy in the United States (Braithwaite and Drahos, 2000, Chapter 7).\n\nAfter the Uruguay round, the GATT became the basis for the establishment of the World Trade Organization.  Because ratification of TRIPS is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organization membership, any country seeking to obtain hard access to the numerous international markets opened by the World Trade Organization must enact the strict intellectual property laws mandated by TRIPS.  For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws.  States like Russia and [[China]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Farah, Paolo Davide|author2=Cima, Elena|date=2010|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1527992|title=China\u2019s Participation in the World Trade Organization: Trade in Goods, Services, Intellectual Property Rights and Transparency Issues\" in Aurelio Lopez-Tarruella Martinez (ed.), El comercio con China. Oportunidades empresariales, incertidumbres jur\u00eddicas, Tirant lo Blanch, |location=Valencia, Spain|pages=85\u2013121|isbn=978-84-8456-981-7}}</ref> that were very unlikely to join the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] have found the prospect of WTO membership a powerful enticement.\n\nFurthermore, unlike other agreements on intellectual property, TRIPS has a powerful enforcement mechanism.  States can be disciplined through the WTO's [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|dispute settlement]] mechanism.\n\n==Requirements==\nTRIPS requires member states to provide strong protection for intellectual property rights. For example, under TRIPS:\n\n* Copyright terms must extend at least 50 years, unless based on the life of the [[author]]. (Art. 12 and 14)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) - agreement text - standards |publisher=WTO |date=1994-04-15 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>\n* Copyright must be granted automatically, and not based upon any \"[[copyright formalities|formality]]\", such as [[copyright registration|registrations]], as specified in the [[Berne Convention]]. (Art. 9)\n* Computer programs must be regarded as \"literary works\" under copyright law and receive the same terms of protection.\n* National [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|exceptions to copyright]] (such as \"[[fair use]]\" in the United States) are constrained by the [[Berne three-step test]]\n* Patents must be granted for \"inventions\" in all \"fields of technology\" provided they meet all other patentability requirements (although exceptions for certain public interests are allowed (Art. 27.2 and 27.3)<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part II \u2014 Standards concerning the availability, scope and use of Intellectual Property Rights; Sections 5 and 6\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm}}</ref> and must be enforceable for at least 20 years (Art 33).\n* Exceptions to exclusive rights must be limited, provided that a normal exploitation of the work (Art.&nbsp;13) and normal exploitation of the patent (Art&nbsp;30) is not in conflict.\n* No unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the right holders of computer programs and patents is allowed.\n* Legitimate interests of third parties have to be taken into account by patent rights (Art&nbsp;30).\n* In each state, intellectual property laws may not offer any benefits to local citizens which are not available to citizens of other TRIPS signatories under the principle of [[national treatment]] (with certain limited exceptions, Art. 3 and 5).<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part I \u2014 General Provisions and Basic Principles\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_03_e.htm}}</ref>  TRIPS also has a [[most favored nation clause]].\n\nThe TRIPS Agreement incorporates by reference the provisions on copyright from the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] (Art 9), with the exception of moral rights. It also incorporated by reference the substantive provisions of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (Art 2.1). The TRIPS Agreement specifically mentions that software and databases are protected by copyright, subject to originality requirement (Art 10).\n\nArticle 10 of the Agreement stipulates:\n\"1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).\n2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.\"\n\n===Access to essential medicines===<!-- This section is linked from [[Patent]] -->\nThe most visible conflict has been over [[AIDS]] drugs in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]].  Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs  for public health programs across Africa, this controversy has not led to a revision of TRIPS. Instead, an interpretive statement, the [[Doha Declaration]], was issued in November 2001, which indicated that TRIPS should not prevent states from dealing with public health crises.  After Doha, [[PhRMA]], the United States and to a lesser extent other developed nations began working to minimize the effect of the declaration.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Timmermann, Cristian|author2=Henk van den Belt|date=2013|title=Intellectual property and global health: from corporate social responsibility to the access to knowledge movement|journal=Liverpool Law Review|volume=34 (1)|pages=47-73}}</ref>\n\nA 2003 agreement loosened the domestic market requirement, and allows developing countries to export to other countries where there is a national health problem as long as drugs exported are not part of a commercial or industrial policy.<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health\n|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/implem_para6_e.htm\n|date=1 September 2003\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization}}</ref> Drugs exported under such a regime may be packaged or colored differently in order to prevent them from prejudicing markets in the developed world.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration also changed its position, concluding that generic treatments might in fact be a component of an effective strategy to combat HIV.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin, \u201c[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2011_life_cycle-libre.pdf The Life-Cycle of Transnational Issues: Lessons from the Access to Medicines Controversy]\u201d, Global Society 25(2) 2011: 227-247.</ref>  Bush created the [[PEPFAR]] program, which received $15 billion from 2003 to 2007, and was reauthorized in 2008 for $48 billion over the next five years.  Despite wavering on the issue of [compulsory licensing], PEPFAR began to distribute generic drugs in 2004\u20135.\n\n===Software and business method patents===\n{{main article|Software patents under TRIPs Agreement}}\nAnother controversy has been over the TRIPS Article 27 requirements for patentability \"in all fields of technology\", and whether or not this necessitates the granting of [[software patent|software]] and [[business method patent]]s.\n\nAccording to article 10 of the TRIPS Agreement the appropriate instrument to protect software protection is copyright. The importance of this instrument has recently been confirmed by the US Supreme Court (''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'').\n\n== Implementation in developing countries ==\n\nThe obligations under TRIPS apply equally to all member states, however [[developing countries]] were allowed extra time to implement the applicable changes to their national laws, in two tiers of transition according to their level of development.  The transition period for developing countries expired in 2005. The transition period for [[least developed countries]] to implement TRIPS was extended to 2013, and until 1 January 2016 for pharmaceutical patents, with the possibility of further extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/tripfq_e.htm|title=WTO - intellectual property (TRIPS) - frequently-asked questions|website=Wto.org|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt has therefore been argued that the TRIPS standard of requiring all countries to create strict intellectual property systems will be detrimental to poorer countries' development.<ref>{{Citation\n |title       = IP Justice policy paper for the WIPO development agenda\n |publisher   = IP Justice\n |url         = http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130108183327/http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |archivedate = 8 January 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.-F.

These collection of standards, known as TRIPS+ or TRIPS-Plus, can take many forms.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin and Dimitri Theriault, [https://www.cigionline.org/publications/how-trade-deals-extend-frontiers-international-patent-law How Trade Deals Extend the Frontiers of International Patent Law], CIGI Paper 199, 2018; {{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195390124.001.0001/acprof-9780195390124-chapter-8|title=Overview of \"TRIPS-Plus\" Standards - Oxford Scholarship|publisher=}}</ref>  General objectives of these agreements include:\n\n* The creation of [[anti-circumvention laws]] to protect [[Digital Rights Management]] systems.  This was achieved through the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty]] (WIPO Treaty) and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]].\n* More stringent restrictions on [[compulsory license]]s for patents.\n* More aggressive patent enforcement.

Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of [[artificial scarcity]] on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism has focused on the failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries.<ref>Ping Xiong \u2018Patents in TRIPS-Plus Provisions and the Approaches to Interpretation of Free Trade Agreements and TRIPS: Do They Affect Public Health?\u2019 (2012) 46(1) Journal of World Trade 155</ref> Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market. In particular, the illegality of pre-clinical trials or submission of samples for approval until a patent expires have been blamed for driving the growth of a few multinationals, rather than developing country producers.\n\n[[Daniele Archibugi]] and [[Andrea Filippetti]]<ref>Archibugi, D. and Filippetti, A.

They argue, however, that the benefits from weakening intellectual property rights strongly depend on whether the governments can credibly commit to using it only in exceptional cases of emergencies since firms may invest less in R&D if they expect repeated episodes of compulsory licensing.   \n\nThe 2002 Doha Declaration affirmed that the TRIPS agreement should not prevent members from taking measures necessary to protect public health. Despite this recognition, less-developed countries have argued that TRIPS's flexible provisions, such as compulsory licensing, are near-on impossible to exercise. In particular, less developed countries have cited their infant domestic manufacturing and technology industries as evidence of the policy's bluntness.\n\nTRIPS-plus conditions mandating standards beyond TRIPS have also been the subject of scrutiny.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin, '[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_tripping.pdf Tripping up TRIPs Debate: IP and Health]', International Journal of Intellectual Property Management 1(1/2), 2006:37-53.</ref> These [[Free trade area|FTA]] agreements contain conditions that limit the ability of governments to introduce competition for generic producers. In particular, the United States has been criticised for advancing protection well beyond the standards mandated by TRIPS. The United States Free Trade Agreements with Australia, Morocco and Bahrain have extended patentability by requiring patents be available for new uses of known products.<ref name=\"auto\">Richard Newfarmer, Trade, Doha, and Development (The World Bank, 1st ed, 2006) 292</ref> The TRIPS agreement allows the grant of compulsory licenses at a nation\u2019s discretion. TRIPS-plus conditions in the United States FTA\u2019s with Australia, Jordan, Singapore and Vietnam have restricted the application of compulsory licenses to emergency situations, antitrust remedies,
