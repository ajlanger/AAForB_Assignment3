It is the 188th entry in the series released by [[Columbia Pictures]] starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Stooges have lost their jobs. Adding insult to injury, they received a letter from Dad with the news that he requires surgery. To help pay for the operation, the father suggests the boys search for [[uranium]] on his mining property. The boys locate the uranium, but run afoul of a load of dynamite. Then, when they are trying to fix the water pump, it starts gushing oil. Joe tries to cork it by sitting on it, but he is sent flying into the air. When he wishes it would stop, it does, much to Moe and Larry's dismay. Joe manages to get the oil started again, and the boys are in the money.\n\n==Production notes==\nThough technically a reworking of ''[[Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise]]'', none of the original plot is featured in this short. In addition, the only recycled footage utilized in ''Oil's Well That Ends Well'' is the shot of [[Curly Howard]] riding the oil gusher up into the sky.
