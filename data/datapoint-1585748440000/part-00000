However, new technology in some programs tries to read the images by attempting to find text in these images. These programs are not very accurate, and sometimes filter out innocent images of products, such as a box that has words on it.\n\nA newer technique, however, is to use an animated [[GIF]] image that does not contain clear text in its initial frame, or to contort the shapes of letters in the image (as in [[CAPTCHA]]) to avoid detection by [[optical character recognition]] tools.\n\n===Blank spam===\nBlank spam is spam lacking a payload advertisement. Often the message body is missing altogether, as well as the subject line. Still, it fits the definition of spam because of its nature as bulk and unsolicited email.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/dealing-with-blank-spam/|title=Dealing with blank spam|website=CNET|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBlank spam may be originated in different ways, either intentional or unintentionally:\n# Blank spam can have been sent in a [[directory harvest attack]], a form of [[dictionary attack]] for gathering valid addresses from an email service provider. Since the goal in such an attack is to use the bounces to separate invalid addresses from the valid ones, spammers may dispense with most elements of the header and the entire message body, and still accomplish their goals.\n# Blank spam may also occur when a spammer forgets or otherwise fails to add the payload when he or she sets up the spam run.\n# Often blank spam headers appear truncated, suggesting that computer glitches, such as [[software bugs]] or other  may have contributed to this problem\u2014from poorly written spam software to malfunctioning relay servers, or any problems that may truncate header lines from the message body.\n# Some spam may appear to be blank when in fact it is not. An example of this is the VBS.Davinia.B email worm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-020713-3220-99|title=symantec.com|publisher=symantec.com|accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> which propagates through messages that have no subject line and appears blank, when in fact it uses HTML code to download other files.\n\n===Backscatter spam===\n{{Main|Backscatter (email)}}\nBackscatter is a side-effect of email spam, [[computer viruses|viruses]], and [[computer worm|worms]]. It happens when email servers are misconfigured to send a bogus [[bounce message]] to the [[envelope sender]] when rejecting or quarantining email (rather than simply rejecting the attempt to send the message).\n\nIf the sender's address was forged, then the bounce may go to an innocent party. Since these messages were not solicited by the recipients, are substantially similar to each other, and are delivered in bulk quantities, they qualify as unsolicited bulk email or spam. As such, systems that generate email backscatter can end up being listed on various [[DNSBL]]s and be in violation of [[internet service provider]]s' [[Terms of Service]].\n\n==Legal countermeasures==\n{{See also|Email spam legislation by country}}\nIf an individual or organisation can identify harm done to them by spam, and identify who sent it; then they may be able to sue for a [[legal remedy]], e.g. on the basis of [[trespass to chattels]]. A number of large civil settlements have been won in this way,<ref>e.g. [[CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.]], [[School of Visual Arts v.

Spammers often use false names, addresses, phone numbers, and other contact information to set up \"disposable\" accounts at various Internet service providers. They also often use falsified or stolen [[credit card]] numbers to pay for these accounts. This allows them to move quickly from one account to the next as the host ISPs discover and shut down each one.\n\nSenders may go to great lengths to conceal the origin of their messages. Large companies may hire another firm to send their messages so that complaints or blocking of email falls on a third party. Others engage in [[Spoofing attack|spoof]]ing of email addresses (much easier than [[IP address spoofing]]). The email protocol ([[SMTP]]) has no authentication by default, so the spammer can pretend to originate a message apparently from any email address. To prevent this, some ISPs and domains require the use of [[SMTP-AUTH]], allowing positive identification of the specific account from which an email originates.\n\nSenders cannot completely spoof email delivery chains (the 'Received' header), since the receiving mailserver records the actual connection from the last mailserver's IP address. To counter this, some spammers forge additional delivery headers to make it appear as if the email had previously traversed many legitimate servers.\n\nSpoofing can have serious consequences for legitimate email users. Not only can their email inboxes get clogged up with \"undeliverable\" emails in addition to volumes of spam, but they can mistakenly be identified as a spammer. Not only may they receive irate email from spam victims, but (if spam victims report the email address owner to the ISP, for example) a naive ISP may terminate their service for spamming.\n\n==Theft of service==\nSpammers frequently seek out and make use of vulnerable third-party systems such as [[open mail relay]]s and open [[proxy server]]s. SMTP forwards mail from one server to another\u2014mail servers that ISPs run commonly require some form of [[authentication]] to ensure that the user is a customer of that ISP.\n\nIncreasingly, spammers use networks of malware-infected PCs ([[Zombie computer|zombies]]) to send their spam. [[Zombie computer|Zombie]] networks are also known as [[botnet]]s (such zombifying malware is known as a ''bot'', short for [[robot]]). In June 2006, an estimated 80 percent of email spam was sent by zombie PCs, an increase of 30 percent from the prior year. An estimated 55&nbsp;billion email spam were sent each day in June 2006, an increase of 25&nbsp;billion per day from June 2005.<ref name=\"ironport\">{{cite press release\n|title=Spammers Continue Innovation: IronPort Study Shows Image-based Spam, Hit & Run, and Increased Volumes Latest Threat to Your Inbox|publisher=IronPort Systems|date=2006-06-28|url=http://www.ironport.com/company/ironport_pr_2006-06-28.html|accessdate=2007-01-05 }}</ref>\n\nFor the first quarter of 2010, an estimated 305,000 newly activated zombie PCs were brought online each day for malicious activity.

[[Forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] must be correctly set for the outgoing mail server and large swaths of IP addresses are blocked, sometimes pre-emptively, to prevent spam.

Each method has strengths and weaknesses and each is controversial because of its weaknesses. For example, one company's offer to \"[remove] some spamtrap and honeypot addresses\" from email lists defeats the ability for those methods to identify spammers.\n\n[[Anti-spam techniques#Outbound spam protection|Outbound spam protection]] combines many of the techniques to scan messages exiting out of a service provider's network, identify spam, and taking action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the message.\n\n==Methods of spammers==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Gathering of addresses===\n{{Main|Email address harvesting}}\n\nIn order to send spam, spammers need to obtain the email addresses of the intended recipients. To this end, both spammers themselves and ''list merchants'' gather huge lists of potential email addresses. Since spam is, by definition, unsolicited, this ''address harvesting'' is done without the consent (and sometimes against the expressed will) of the address owners. A single spam run may target tens of millions of possible addresses \u2013 many of which are invalid, malformed, or undeliverable.\n\n===Obfuscating message content===\nMany spam-filtering techniques work by searching for patterns in the headers or bodies of messages. For instance, a user may decide that all email they receive with the word \"[[Sildenafil|Viagra]]\" in the subject line is spam, and instruct their mail program to automatically delete all such messages. To defeat such filters, the spammer may intentionally misspell commonly filtered words or insert other characters, often in a style similar to [[leetspeak]], as in the following examples: <tt>V1agra</tt>, <tt>Via'gra</tt>, <tt>Vi@graa</tt>, <tt>vi*gra</tt>, <tt>\\/iagra</tt>. This also allows for many different ways to express a given word, making identifying them all more difficult for filter software.\n\nThe principle of this method is to leave the word readable to humans (who can easily recognize the intended word for such misspellings), but not likely to be recognized by a computer program. This is only somewhat effective, because modern filter patterns have been designed to recognize blacklisted terms in the various iterations of misspelling. Other filters target the actual obfuscation methods, such as the non-standard use of punctuation or numerals into unusual places. Similarly, HTML-based email gives the spammer more tools to obfuscate text. Inserting HTML comments between letters can foil some filters. Another common ploy involves presenting the text as an image, which is either sent along or loaded from a remote server.\n\n===Defeating Bayesian filters ===\nAs [[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian filtering]] has become popular as a spam-filtering technique, spammers have started using methods to weaken it. To a rough approximation, Bayesian filters rely on word probabilities. If a message contains many words that are used only in spam, and few that are never used in spam, it is likely to be spam. To weaken Bayesian filters, some spammers, alongside the sales pitch, now include lines of irrelevant, random words, in a technique known as [[Bayesian poisoning]].\n\n===Spam-support services===\nA number of other online activities and business practices are considered by anti-spam activists to be connected to spamming.  These are sometimes termed '''spam-support services''': business services, other than the actual sending of spam itself, which permit the spammer to continue operating. Spam-support services can include processing orders for goods advertised in spam, hosting Web sites or [[Domain Name System|DNS]] records referenced in spam messages, or a number of specific services as follows:\n\nSome Internet hosting firms advertise '''bulk-friendly''' or '''bulletproof hosting'''. This means that, unlike most ISPs, they will not terminate a customer for spamming. These hosting firms operate as clients of larger ISPs, and many have eventually been taken offline by these larger ISPs as a result of complaints regarding spam activity. Thus, while a firm may advertise bulletproof hosting, it is ultimately unable to deliver without the connivance of its upstream ISP. However, some spammers have managed to get what is called a [[pink contract]] (see below) \u2013 a contract with the ISP that allows them to spam without being disconnected.\n\nA few companies produce '''[[spamware]]''', or software designed for spammers. Spamware varies widely, but may include the ability to import thousands of addresses, to generate random addresses, to insert fraudulent headers into messages, to use dozens or hundreds of mail servers simultaneously, and to make use of open relays. The sale of spamware is illegal in eight U.S. states.<ref name=\"spamsights1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spamsights.org|title=Spamware vendor list|publisher=Spam Sights|accessdate=2007-01-06|date=2005-07-08|author=Sapient Fridge}}</ref><ref name=\"spaumhaus3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/policy.html|title=SBL Policy & Listing Criteria|accessdate=2007-01-06|date=2006-12-22|publisher=The Spamhaus Project}} ''original location was at {{citation|url=http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/sbl-rationale.html|title=SBL rationale}}; the referenced page is an auto-redirect target from the original location''</ref><ref name=\"bitpipe\">{{cite journal|title=Spamware \u2013 Email Address Harvesting Tools and Anonymous Bulk Emailing Software|publisher=MX Logic (abstract hosted by Bit Pipe)|date=2004-10-01|url=http://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1097086148_134.html|accessdate=2007-01-06}} ''the link here is to an abstract of a white paper; registration with the authoring organization is required to obtain the full white paper''.</ref>\n\nSo-called '''millions CDs''' are commonly advertised in spam. These are [[CD-ROM]]s purportedly containing lists of email addresses, for use in sending spam to these addresses. Such lists are also sold directly online, frequently with the false claim that the owners of the listed addresses have requested (or \"opted in\") to be included. Such lists often contain invalid addresses. In recent years, these have fallen almost entirely out of use due to the low quality email addresses available on them, and because some email lists exceed 20GB in size. The [[CD-ROM#Capacity|amount you can fit on a CD]] is no longer substantial.\n\nA number of [[DNSBL|DNS blacklists]] (DNSBLs), including the MAPS RBL, Spamhaus SBL, SORBS and SPEWS, target the providers of spam-support services as well as spammers. DNSBLs blacklist IPs or ranges of IPs to persuade ISPs to terminate services with known customers who are spammers or resell to spammers.\n\n==Related vocabulary==\n;Unsolicited bulk email (UBE)\n:A synonym for email spam.\n;Unsolicited commercial email (UCE)\n:Spam promoting a commercial service or product.

However, new technology in some programs tries to read the images by attempting to find text in these images. These programs are not very accurate, and sometimes filter out innocent images of products, such as a box that has words on it.\n\nA newer technique, however, is to use an animated [[GIF]] image that does not contain clear text in its initial frame, or to contort the shapes of letters in the image (as in [[CAPTCHA]]) to avoid detection by [[optical character recognition]] tools.\n\n===Blank spam===\nBlank spam is spam lacking a payload advertisement. Often the message body is missing altogether, as well as the subject line. Still, it fits the definition of spam because of its nature as bulk and unsolicited email.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/dealing-with-blank-spam/|title=Dealing with blank spam|website=CNET|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBlank spam may be originated in different ways, either intentional or unintentionally:\n# Blank spam can have been sent in a [[directory harvest attack]], a form of [[dictionary attack]] for gathering valid addresses from an email service provider. Since the goal in such an attack is to use the bounces to separate invalid addresses from the valid ones, spammers may dispense with most elements of the header and the entire message body, and still accomplish their goals.\n# Blank spam may also occur when a spammer forgets or otherwise fails to add the payload when he or she sets up the spam run.\n# Often blank spam headers appear truncated, suggesting that computer glitches, such as [[software bugs]] or other  may have contributed to this problem\u2014from poorly written spam software to malfunctioning relay servers, or any problems that may truncate header lines from the message body.\n# Some spam may appear to be blank when in fact it is not. An example of this is the VBS.Davinia.B email worm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-020713-3220-99|title=symantec.com|publisher=symantec.com|accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> which propagates through messages that have no subject line and appears blank, when in fact it uses HTML code to download other files.\n\n===Backscatter spam===\n{{Main|Backscatter (email)}}\nBackscatter is a side-effect of email spam, [[computer viruses|viruses]], and [[computer worm|worms]]. It happens when email servers are misconfigured to send a bogus [[bounce message]] to the [[envelope sender]] when rejecting or quarantining email (rather than simply rejecting the attempt to send the message).\n\nIf the sender's address was forged, then the bounce may go to an innocent party. Since these messages were not solicited by the recipients, are substantially similar to each other, and are delivered in bulk quantities, they qualify as unsolicited bulk email or spam. As such, systems that generate email backscatter can end up being listed on various [[DNSBL]]s and be in violation of [[internet service provider]]s' [[Terms of Service]].\n\n==Legal countermeasures==\n{{See also|Email spam legislation by country}}\nIf an individual or organisation can identify harm done to them by spam, and identify who sent it; then they may be able to sue for a [[legal remedy]], e.g. on the basis of [[trespass to chattels]].

Spammers often use false names, addresses, phone numbers, and other contact information to set up \"disposable\" accounts at various Internet service providers. They also often use falsified or stolen [[credit card]] numbers to pay for these accounts. This allows them to move quickly from one account to the next as the host ISPs discover and shut down each one.\n\nSenders may go to great lengths to conceal the origin of their messages. Large companies may hire another firm to send their messages so that complaints or blocking of email falls on a third party. Others engage in [[Spoofing attack|spoof]]ing of email addresses (much easier than [[IP address spoofing]]). The email protocol ([[SMTP]]) has no authentication by default, so the spammer can pretend to originate a message apparently from any email address. To prevent this, some ISPs and domains require the use of [[SMTP-AUTH]], allowing positive identification of the specific account from which an email originates.\n\nSenders cannot completely spoof email delivery chains (the 'Received' header), since the receiving mailserver records the actual connection from the last mailserver's IP address. To counter this, some spammers forge additional delivery headers to make it appear as if the email had previously traversed many legitimate servers.\n\nSpoofing can have serious consequences for legitimate email users. Not only can their email inboxes get clogged up with \"undeliverable\" emails in addition to volumes of spam, but they can mistakenly be identified as a spammer. Not only may they receive irate email from spam victims, but (if spam victims report the email address owner to the ISP, for example) a naive ISP may terminate their service for spamming.\n\n==Theft of service==\nSpammers frequently seek out and make use of vulnerable third-party systems such as [[open mail relay]]s and open [[proxy server]]s. SMTP forwards mail from one server to another\u2014mail servers that ISPs run commonly require some form of [[authentication]] to ensure that the user is a customer of that ISP.\n\nIncreasingly, spammers use networks of malware-infected PCs ([[Zombie computer|zombies]]) to send their spam. [[Zombie computer|Zombie]] networks are also known as [[botnet]]s (such zombifying malware is known as a ''bot'', short for [[robot]]). In June 2006, an estimated 80 percent of email spam was sent by zombie PCs, an increase of 30 percent from the prior year. An estimated 55&nbsp;billion email spam were sent each day in June 2006, an increase of 25&nbsp;billion per day from June 2005.<ref name=\"ironport\">{{cite press release\n|title=Spammers Continue Innovation: IronPort Study Shows Image-based Spam, Hit & Run, and Increased Volumes Latest Threat to Your Inbox|publisher=IronPort Systems|date=2006-06-28|url=http://www.ironport.com/company/ironport_pr_2006-06-28.html|accessdate=2007-01-05 }}</ref>\n\nFor the first quarter of 2010, an estimated 305,000 newly activated zombie PCs were brought online each day for malicious activity.

[[Forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] must be correctly set for the outgoing mail server and large swaths of IP addresses are blocked, sometimes pre-emptively, to prevent spam.

Each method has strengths and weaknesses and each is controversial because of its weaknesses. For example, one company's offer to \"[remove] some spamtrap and honeypot addresses\" from email lists defeats the ability for those methods to identify spammers.\n\n[[Anti-spam techniques#Outbound spam protection|Outbound spam protection]] combines many of the techniques to scan messages exiting out of a service provider's network, identify spam, and taking action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the message.\n\n==Methods of spammers==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Gathering of addresses===\n{{Main|Email address harvesting}}\n\nIn order to send spam, spammers need to obtain the email addresses of the intended recipients. To this end, both spammers themselves and ''list merchants'' gather huge lists of potential email addresses. Since spam is, by definition, unsolicited, this ''address harvesting'' is done without the consent (and sometimes against the expressed will) of the address owners. A single spam run may target tens of millions of possible addresses \u2013 many of which are invalid, malformed, or undeliverable.\n\n===Obfuscating message content===\nMany spam-filtering techniques work by searching for patterns in the headers or bodies of messages. For instance, a user may decide that all email they receive with the word \"[[Sildenafil|Viagra]]\" in the subject line is spam, and instruct their mail program to automatically delete all such messages. To defeat such filters, the spammer may intentionally misspell commonly filtered words or insert other characters, often in a style similar to [[leetspeak]], as in the following examples: <tt>V1agra</tt>, <tt>Via'gra</tt>, <tt>Vi@graa</tt>, <tt>vi*gra</tt>, <tt>\\/iagra</tt>. This also allows for many different ways to express a given word, making identifying them all more difficult for filter software.\n\nThe principle of this method is to leave the word readable to humans (who can easily recognize the intended word for such misspellings), but not likely to be recognized by a computer program. This is only somewhat effective, because modern filter patterns have been designed to recognize blacklisted terms in the various iterations of misspelling. Other filters target the actual obfuscation methods, such as the non-standard use of punctuation or numerals into unusual places. Similarly, HTML-based email gives the spammer more tools to obfuscate text. Inserting HTML comments between letters can foil some filters. Another common ploy involves presenting the text as an image, which is either sent along or loaded from a remote server.\n\n===Defeating Bayesian filters ===\nAs [[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian filtering]] has become popular as a spam-filtering technique, spammers have started using methods to weaken it. To a rough approximation, Bayesian filters rely on word probabilities. If a message contains many words that are used only in spam, and few that are never used in spam, it is likely to be spam. To weaken Bayesian filters, some spammers, alongside the sales pitch, now include lines of irrelevant, random words, in a technique known as [[Bayesian poisoning]].\n\n===Spam-support services===\nA number of other online activities and business practices are considered by anti-spam activists to be connected to spamming.  These are sometimes termed '''spam-support services''': business services, other than the actual sending of spam itself, which permit the spammer to continue operating. Spam-support services can include processing orders for goods advertised in spam, hosting Web sites or [[Domain Name System|DNS]] records referenced in spam messages, or a number of specific services as follows:\n\nSome Internet hosting firms advertise '''bulk-friendly''' or '''bulletproof hosting'''. This means that, unlike most ISPs, they will not terminate a customer for spamming. These hosting firms operate as clients of larger ISPs, and many have eventually been taken offline by these larger ISPs as a result of complaints regarding spam activity. Thus, while a firm may advertise bulletproof hosting, it is ultimately unable to deliver without the connivance of its upstream ISP. However, some spammers have managed to get what is called a [[pink contract]] (see below) \u2013 a contract with the ISP that allows them to spam without being disconnected.\n\nA few companies produce '''[[spamware]]''', or software designed for spammers. Spamware varies widely, but may include the ability to import thousands of addresses, to generate random addresses, to insert fraudulent headers into messages, to use dozens or hundreds of mail servers simultaneously, and to make use of open relays. The sale of spamware is illegal in eight U.S. states.<ref name=\"spamsights1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spamsights.org|title=Spamware vendor list|publisher=Spam Sights|accessdate=2007-01-06|date=2005-07-08|author=Sapient Fridge}}</ref><ref name=\"spaumhaus3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/policy.html|title=SBL Policy & Listing Criteria|accessdate=2007-01-06|date=2006-12-22|publisher=The Spamhaus Project}} ''original location was at {{citation|url=http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/sbl-rationale.html|title=SBL rationale}}; the referenced page is an auto-redirect target from the original location''</ref><ref name=\"bitpipe\">{{cite journal|title=Spamware \u2013 Email Address Harvesting Tools and Anonymous Bulk Emailing Software|publisher=MX Logic (abstract hosted by Bit Pipe)|date=2004-10-01|url=http://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1097086148_134.html|accessdate=2007-01-06}} ''the link here is to an abstract of a white paper; registration with the authoring organization is required to obtain the full white paper''.</ref>\n\nSo-called '''millions CDs''' are commonly advertised in spam. These are [[CD-ROM]]s purportedly containing lists of email addresses, for use in sending spam to these addresses. Such lists are also sold directly online, frequently with the false claim that the owners of the listed addresses have requested (or \"opted in\") to be included. Such lists often contain invalid addresses. In recent years, these have fallen almost entirely out of use due to the low quality email addresses available on them, and because some email lists exceed 20GB in size. The [[CD-ROM#Capacity|amount you can fit on a CD]] is no longer substantial.\n\nA number of [[DNSBL|DNS blacklists]] (DNSBLs), including the MAPS RBL, Spamhaus SBL, SORBS and SPEWS, target the providers of spam-support services as well as spammers. DNSBLs blacklist IPs or ranges of IPs to persuade ISPs to terminate services with known customers who are spammers or resell to spammers.\n\n==Related vocabulary==\n;Unsolicited bulk email (UBE)\n:A synonym for email spam.\n;Unsolicited commercial email (UCE)\n:Spam promoting a commercial service or product.
