Officials facing election have an incentive to understate the headline CPI figure. Opposition figures frequently relied on estimates made by figures such as [[Orlando Ferreres]] (a former [[Bunge y Born]] agribusiness executive and Economic Planning Secretary for a leading opponent, former President [[Carlos Menem]]).<ref>Christian, Shirley.

An alternative explanation for the policy could rest on government finances: the national government has issued around US$100 billion in [[government bonds]]. Payments on almost US$50 billion of this are indexed to inflation.<ref>Forero, Juan.

A 7-point underestimate in inflation could save the [[Central Bank of Argentina]] US$3 billion in inflation-indexed interest payments, while higher economic growth would cost added interest on bonds tied to GDP; hence, there is a short-run financial benefit to the government from a discrepancy between the two inflation readings in the table.<ref>[http://www.offnews.info/downloads/CERvsPBI.pdf ''Offnews'']</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Since 2007, when Guillermo Moreno, the secretary of internal trade, was sent into the statistics institute, INDEC, to tell its staff that their figures had better not show inflation shooting up, prices and the official record have parted ways. Private-sector economists and statistical offices of provincial governments show inflation two to three times higher than INDEC's number (which only covers greater Buenos Aires).
