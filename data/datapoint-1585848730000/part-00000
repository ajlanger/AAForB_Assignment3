It serves roughly 3,100 students, making it by far the largest high school in New Hampshire, more than 1300 students greater than the [[Nashua High School South|next largest high school]].<ref name=About>{{cite web| url=http://www.pinkertonacademy.org/index.php/about/about-pinkerton-academy| title=About Pinkerton Academy| publisher=Pinkerton Academy| accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> Pinkerton's situation is unusual, as it is a [[private school]] which also serves as the \"public\" high school (grades 9\u201312) for the communities of Derry, [[Hampstead, New Hampshire|Hampstead]], [[Chester, New Hampshire|Chester]], [[Auburn, New Hampshire|Auburn]], [[Candia, New Hampshire|Candia]], and [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]]. Through arrangements with the towns, each town pays the tuition for their students to attend Pinkerton. Pinkerton Academy is a private, non-profit corporation administered by a [[headmaster]], who in turn acts under the direction of a self-perpetuating [[board of trustees]].\n\nThe academy is set on a {{convert|120|acre|adj=on}} [[New England]] campus. Since the original four-room Old Academy Building opened in 1815, over one dozen major buildings have been constructed, for academics and administration.\n\n==History==\nIn 1793, a classical high school was established in the eastern part of [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]] (split off in 1827 as the town of Derry) and was maintained for twenty years by direct tax, tuition, and voluntary contributions. In 1814, Reverend Edward Parker asked Major John Pinkerton and Elder James Pinkerton, who had made significant contributions to the classical high school, to make the school permanent. Later that year, they obtained an act incorporating the school under the name Pinkerton Academy from the state legislature. The academy opened on December 4, 1815, as an all-male institution with an endowment of $16,000 by John Pinkerton \"for the purpose of promoting piety and virtue and the education of youth in science, languages, and the liberal arts.\"<ref name=Fay>{{cite book\n  | last = Fay\n  | first = Edwin Whitfield\n  | authorlink = Edwin Whitfield Fay\n  | title = Circular of Information\n  | publisher = Washington Government Printing Office\n  | year = 1898\n  | url =\n  }}</ref>[[Image:John Morrison Pinkerton.png|left|thumb|John Morrison Pinkerton, son of Elder James]]\nBy 1817, the Pinkerton Academy accepted young women as well. An advertisement placed on May 17, 1817, in the ''Farmer's Cabinet'', the only newspaper of the era serving that part of New Hampshire, stated, \"The female apartment in this academy will be opened on Monday the 26th of May, instant; wherein will be taught all the useful and ornamental branches of female instruction usually attended in similar institutions. At the same time an additional instructor will be placed in the male apartment. The tuition is two dollars a quarter. Board may be had in respectable families, within a convenient distance of the Academy, on reasonable terms.\" According to the [[New Hampshire Historical Society]], preceptresses of the academy were Sarah Fitz, 1816, Mary Knight, 1817\u201318, and Mary Adams, 1819. In 1821, Pinkerton stopped accepting young women, and the Adams Female Academy opened in Derry to educate young women. For the following years, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants of Londonderry helped maintain the academy and also contributed funds for it. In 1853 the academy became coeducational with the erection of a ladies' boarding hall.<ref name = stearns>{{cite book\n  | last = Stearns\n  | first = Ezra\n  |author2=William F.

The right building is the one created using John Pinkerton's bequest.]]\nIn 1881, upon the death of John Morrison Pinkerton, son of Elder James, the academy received a second bequest. The Trustees used these funds to increase the number of instructors and to provide for an enlarged and advanced program of studies. Changes in the curriculum and the completion of the Pinkerton Building in 1887 allowed Pinkerton students to choose from a variety of college and non-college bound programs of studies. The funds were also used to buy a library and to erect a new school building.  This was a large erection, but was completed quickly and the scenic landscape accented the beautiful new buildings.<ref name = stearns />\n\nPinkerton continued to function as an independent day and boarding school until 1948. In 1949, the academy entered into an agreement with the town of Derry that marked a significant turning point in the school's history. As a result of the service agreement, Pinkerton educated all high school aged students who lived in Derry. The town of Derry paid for the school's services on a per pupil tuition basis. Although Pinkerton maintained its private school status, the academy began to function as a comprehensive independent academy.\n\nIn 1962, the town of Derry negotiated a long-term contractual agreement with Pinkerton Academy. The contract specified the terms and conditions under which Pinkerton's services were purchased. Over the next thirty years, additional communities ([[Chester, New Hampshire|Chester]], [[Hampstead, New Hampshire|Hampstead]], [[Auburn, New Hampshire|Auburn]], [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]] and [[Windham, New Hampshire|Windham]]) signed service contracts with the academy. In response to the increased number of public school students attending Pinkerton, new facilities were built. Due to the changing needs and interests of this larger student population, Pinkerton once again developed new courses and fields of study while maintaining its existing college preparatory programs. In 1978, the citizens of Londonderry voted to end their tuition agreements with the academy and established [[Londonderry High School]].<ref name=LondonderryProfile>{{cite web |url=http://schools.londonderry.org/assets/documents/common/districtProfile.pdf |title=Londonderry School District Profile |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |publisher=Londonderry School District |work=Londonderry School District |date=December 3, 2004 |format=[[PDF]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007095948/http://schools.londonderry.org/assets/documents/common/districtProfile.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Students from Windham also no longer attend Pinkerton Academy and now attend Windham High School which opened in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.windhamsd.org/ | title = Windham School District Official Home Page | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.windhamsd.org/highschool/ | title = Windham High School Official Home Page | accessdate = 2008-01-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071208080126/http://www.windhamsd.org/highschool/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-08}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years several new buildings have been constructed, including two new buildings in 2013\u201314 funded by a state grant for Career and Technical Education (CTE): CTE Annex and CTE South. These two buildings house Architecture, Drafting and Design, Environmental Science, Electrical Engineering, Engineering, Manufacturing, Cosmetology and Animal Science. In 2011, the Academy Building opened as the base for the Freshmen Academy model of transitioning 9th graders from middle school to high school, and the Arts and Humanities Center was dedicated in 2002. \n[[Image:Pinkerton Academy advertisement 1909.png|left|thumb|1909 advertisement for the school]]\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:Pinkertontower.JPG|thumb|Pinkerton Academy]]\nPinkerton Academy's property spans over {{convert|170|acre|km2}}; a {{convert|120|acre|adj=on}} campus in Derry and a {{convert|50|acre|adj=on}} forest preserve in Chester.

It serves roughly 3,100 students, making it by far the largest high school in New Hampshire, more than 1300 students greater than the [[Nashua High School South|next largest high school]].<ref name=About>{{cite web| url=http://www.pinkertonacademy.org/index.php/about/about-pinkerton-academy| title=About Pinkerton Academy| publisher=Pinkerton Academy| accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> Pinkerton's situation is unusual, as it is a [[private school]] which also serves as the \"public\" high school (grades 9\u201312) for the communities of Derry, [[Hampstead, New Hampshire|Hampstead]], [[Chester, New Hampshire|Chester]], [[Auburn, New Hampshire|Auburn]], [[Candia, New Hampshire|Candia]], and [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]]. Through arrangements with the towns, each town pays the tuition for their students to attend Pinkerton. Pinkerton Academy is a private, non-profit corporation administered by a [[headmaster]], who in turn acts under the direction of a self-perpetuating [[board of trustees]].\n\nThe academy is set on a {{convert|120|acre|adj=on}} [[New England]] campus. Since the original four-room Old Academy Building opened in 1815, over one dozen major buildings have been constructed, for academics and administration.\n\n==History==\nIn 1793, a classical high school was established in the eastern part of [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]] (split off in 1827 as the town of Derry) and was maintained for twenty years by direct tax, tuition, and voluntary contributions. In 1814, Reverend Edward Parker asked Major John Pinkerton and Elder James Pinkerton, who had made significant contributions to the classical high school, to make the school permanent. Later that year, they obtained an act incorporating the school under the name Pinkerton Academy from the state legislature. The academy opened on December 4, 1815, as an all-male institution with an endowment of $16,000 by John Pinkerton \"for the purpose of promoting piety and virtue and the education of youth in science, languages, and the liberal arts.\"<ref name=Fay>{{cite book\n  | last = Fay\n  | first = Edwin Whitfield\n  | authorlink = Edwin Whitfield Fay\n  | title = Circular of Information\n  | publisher = Washington Government Printing Office\n  | year = 1898\n  | url =\n  }}</ref>[[Image:John Morrison Pinkerton.png|left|thumb|John Morrison Pinkerton, son of Elder James]]\nBy 1817, the Pinkerton Academy accepted young women as well. An advertisement placed on May 17, 1817, in the ''Farmer's Cabinet'', the only newspaper of the era serving that part of New Hampshire, stated, \"The female apartment in this academy will be opened on Monday the 26th of May, instant; wherein will be taught all the useful and ornamental branches of female instruction usually attended in similar institutions. At the same time an additional instructor will be placed in the male apartment. The tuition is two dollars a quarter. Board may be had in respectable families, within a convenient distance of the Academy, on reasonable terms.\" According to the [[New Hampshire Historical Society]], preceptresses of the academy were Sarah Fitz, 1816, Mary Knight, 1817\u201318, and Mary Adams, 1819. In 1821, Pinkerton stopped accepting young women, and the Adams Female Academy opened in Derry to educate young women. For the following years, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants of Londonderry helped maintain the academy and also contributed funds for it. In 1853 the academy became coeducational with the erection of a ladies' boarding hall.<ref name = stearns>{{cite book\n  | last = Stearns\n  | first = Ezra\n  |author2=William F.

The right building is the one created using John Pinkerton's bequest.]]\nIn 1881, upon the death of John Morrison Pinkerton, son of Elder James, the academy received a second bequest. The Trustees used these funds to increase the number of instructors and to provide for an enlarged and advanced program of studies. Changes in the curriculum and the completion of the Pinkerton Building in 1887 allowed Pinkerton students to choose from a variety of college and non-college bound programs of studies. The funds were also used to buy a library and to erect a new school building.  This was a large erection, but was completed quickly and the scenic landscape accented the beautiful new buildings.<ref name = stearns />\n\nPinkerton continued to function as an independent day and boarding school until 1948. In 1949, the academy entered into an agreement with the town of Derry that marked a significant turning point in the school's history. As a result of the service agreement, Pinkerton educated all high school aged students who lived in Derry. The town of Derry paid for the school's services on a per pupil tuition basis. Although Pinkerton maintained its private school status, the academy began to function as a comprehensive independent academy.\n\nIn 1962, the town of Derry negotiated a long-term contractual agreement with Pinkerton Academy. The contract specified the terms and conditions under which Pinkerton's services were purchased. Over the next thirty years, additional communities ([[Chester, New Hampshire|Chester]], [[Hampstead, New Hampshire|Hampstead]], [[Auburn, New Hampshire|Auburn]], [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]] and [[Windham, New Hampshire|Windham]]) signed service contracts with the academy. In response to the increased number of public school students attending Pinkerton, new facilities were built. Due to the changing needs and interests of this larger student population, Pinkerton once again developed new courses and fields of study while maintaining its existing college preparatory programs. In 1978, the citizens of Londonderry voted to end their tuition agreements with the academy and established [[Londonderry High School]].<ref name=LondonderryProfile>{{cite web |url=http://schools.londonderry.org/assets/documents/common/districtProfile.pdf |title=Londonderry School District Profile |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |publisher=Londonderry School District |work=Londonderry School District |date=December 3, 2004 |format=[[PDF]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007095948/http://schools.londonderry.org/assets/documents/common/districtProfile.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Students from Windham also no longer attend Pinkerton Academy and now attend Windham High School which opened in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.windhamsd.org/ | title = Windham School District Official Home Page | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.windhamsd.org/highschool/ | title = Windham High School Official Home Page | accessdate = 2008-01-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071208080126/http://www.windhamsd.org/highschool/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-08}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years several new buildings have been constructed, including two new buildings in 2013\u201314 funded by a state grant for Career and Technical Education (CTE): CTE Annex and CTE South.
