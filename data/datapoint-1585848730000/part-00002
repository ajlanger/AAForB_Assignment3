He was the commander of torpedo bombers in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] that crippled several [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleships and sank carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']]. He was killed in action during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.\n\n==Early career==\nShigeharu Murata entered [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1927 and graduated from 58th class in November 1930. In April 1932, he completed a navy pilot training program at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) and was commissioned as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in November 1933. In July 1934, he was assigned to [[Tateyama, Chiba|Tateyama]] (NAS) and in October 1935 to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]'' . In October 1936, he served as an instructor at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] and was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in December. In 1937, he was transferred to 13th Air Group and participated in early stages of [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. He was also involved in [[USS Panay incident]] in 12 December 1937.\n\nIn March 1938, Lieutenant Murata was transferred to 12th Air Group and assigned as one of the flight division leaders ([[buntaich\u014d]]). There he participated in strikes on [[Hankou]] in [[Central China]]. In December, he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]'' and became flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) in torpedo bomber squadron. In June 1939, he was assigned to [[Usa, \u014cita|Usa]] NAS in [[\u014cita Prefecture]] on [[Kyushu]] and in October he began an advanced training course for torpedo attack specialization at [[Yokosuka]] NAS. In November 1940, he was appointed as an instructor at the same NAS and conducted research on torpedo attack technique in shallow waters.\n\n==Pacific War==\nIn September 1941, Lieutenant Murata was transferred to ''Akagi'' again. He was assigned as torpedo squadron leader (as [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]) and was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]]. He participated in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], where commanded the torpedo bombers that crippled the battleship line. After that he participated in the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] and subsequently in the [[Battle of Midway]]. He was on board ''Akagi'' when the bomb released by Lieutenant [[Richard Halsey Best|Dick Best]] hit the carrier and set it afire.\n\nIn July 1942, Lieutenant Commander Murata was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Sh\u014dkaku]]'' and was assigned as its torpedo bomber squadron leader (as [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]). In late August 1942, he participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], however he did not see any action. According to the doctrine at that time, [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers were held in reserve for the second strike wave that would be send after [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers would soften up the enemy fleet. The dive bomber strikes under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Mamoru Seki]] (''Sh\u014dkaku'') and Lieutenant [[Sadamu Takahashi]] (''Zuikaku'') were launched late in the afternoon and there was no possibility to launch a second wave of torpedo bombers.\n\nIn late October 1942, Lieutenant Commander Murata participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], where he commanded the first strike wave that consisted of 21 D3A dive bombers, 20 B5N torpedo bombers and 21 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] fighters. Dive bombers were led by Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi from ''Zuikaku'', while four escorting ''Sh\u014dkaku'' fighters were led by Lieutenant Miyajima Hisayoshi, eight from ''Zuikaku'' by  Lieutenant [[Ayao Shirane]] and nine from [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuih\u014d'']] by Lieutenant [[Moriyasu Hidaka]]. One the way, the IJN strike force encountered a USN strike force on a reciprocal course. At that point Lieutenant Hidaka and his nine Zeros abandoned the escort duty and attacked the USN aircraft. When the rest of the strike force approached the USN fleet, Murata led an extremely well coordinated joint torpedo and dive-bombing attack that achieved three bomb and two torpedo hits on carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']]. The torpedo released by Murata appeared to have been among the two that hit the carrier. However, during the attack Murata's B5N was hit by anti-aircraft artillery and was destroyed in flames.\n\nHe was one of many experienced carrier pilot leaders that were lost in the battle; among them was his academy classmate Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki, who led the second wave strike that severely damaged ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]''. He was posthumously promoted by two ranks to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] and received a special individual citation by IJN.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Murata, Shigeharu}}\n[[Category:1909 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:1942 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= Shigeharu Murata\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=y|1909|4|9}}\n|death_date={{death date and age|df=y|1942|10|26|1909|3|8}}\n|birth_place=[[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=[[Solomon Islands]]\n|image=Murata Shigeharu.jpg\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Captain]]\n|commands=\n|unit= ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]''<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]<br/>12th Air Group<br/>13th Air Group\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Murata}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Shigeharu Murata'''|\u6751\u7530 \u91cd\u6cbb|Murata Shigeharu|}} was a [[torpedo bomber]] pilot [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].
