The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 2 April, there have been 97 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 2 April, there have been 97 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.
