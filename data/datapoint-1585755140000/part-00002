According to a charter, Cs\u00e1nyi and his companions requested a copy of the document from [[Judge royal]] Peter Szentgy\u00f6rgyi de Bazin. By that time, he has gained considerable wealth, as the \"nobles of Zala County\" (i.e. ''generalis congregatio'', the county assembly) borrowed him 1,100 florin to establish and equip ''[[militia portalis]]'' in 1506.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAccording to historian Ir\u00e9n Bilkei, Cs\u00e1nyi again served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County in 1511, but his name did not appear in archontological lists in that year. He was appointed juror during a trial by the general assembly which sentenced \"proscribed\" nobles in 1512.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}} As a tax registration from 1513 preserved, Cs\u00e1nyi had seven ''porta'' (or peasant household) and resided in Cs\u00e1ny in a stone-built manor house, which later was enlarged to a fortress by his son [[\u00c1kos Cs\u00e1nyi|\u00c1kos]] in the middle of the 16th century. An Italian cartographer and military engineer Giulio Turco depicted the ground plan of the fort in a drawing in 1569, among other castles and strongholds. The maps are displayed in the ''Kriegsarchiv'' of [[Vienna]]. However, Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi himself did not hold any castle.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAlongside Detre Rajki, he was referred to as \"the king's man\" in 1516 during an investigation of a suspected violation of law by Tam\u00e1s Pet\u0151 de Gerse.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In the same year, as one of the representatives of the lesser nobility (the so-called noble jurors), Cs\u00e1nyi was elected to the royal council of the young [[Louis II of Hungary]], who ascended the throne shortly before.{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Louis reaffirmed the land donations to the Cs\u00e1nyi family upon Bal\u00e1zs' request. Cs\u00e1nyi served as envoy of Zala County at the Diet of B\u00e1cs in 1518 (today [[Ba\u010d, Serbia]]). He was again mentioned as a noble juror of the royal council in 1519.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In 1520, Mikl\u00f3s Kapornay, Abbot of Zalav\u00e1r wrote in his document that Cs\u00e1nyi guaranteed the debt payment of the abbey to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Istv\u00e1n Terj\u00e9k, in exchange for the collateral of [[Zalav\u00e1r]] domain. On 3 July 1520, King Louis II commissioned Cs\u00e1nyi, among others, to investigate the report of the Buda Chapter, which complained that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kanizsai's soldiers attacked its serfs in the chapel estates of [[Zalakaros|Karos]] and [[Galambok]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} From 17 September 1520 to 1527, Cs\u00e1nyi served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County for the second (or third) time.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=252}} Meanwhile, he functioned as ''isp\u00e1n'' (or head) of the chamber of salt in [[Transylvania]] in 1523, as his own charter claimed. He held that position, when his relative, the influential Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny de Cs\u00e9b held the dignity of ''isp\u00e1n'' of chamber of salt in [[M\u00e1ramaros County|M\u00e1ramaros]] (today [[Maramure\u0219]], [[Romania]]).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\nCs\u00e1nyi did not participate in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], where his relatives, Ambrus S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny and Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny were killed. He held the office of vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County until 1527. In that year, he represented his county alongside Istv\u00e1n Gyulafi and D\u00e9nes H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi at the Diet of [[Buda]] which was convened by [[John Z\u00e1polya]].{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=241}} Following that Cs\u00e1nyi gradually retired from public life. On 1 January 1529, he bought lands in Als\u00f3kust\u00e1n from local noble L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Holl\u00f3si. A county ''dicalis'' of 1531 listed Cs\u00e1nyi's property: 12 ''porta''s in Cs\u00e1ny and 16 ''porta''s in [[Vindornyasz\u0151l\u0151s]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}} In his last years, he was ''familiar'' to the powerful [[N\u00e1dasdy family]] alongside his brother and sons. According to an undated letter of his son \u00c1kos to his lord [[Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy]], his father Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi and two of his brothers, Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of a plague which had broken out following the Ottoman campaign and the [[Siege of G\u00fcns|Siege of K\u0151szeg]] in the summer of 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}}\n\n==Family==\nBased on a document of fragmentary genealogical data from the early 16th century,{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Ir\u00e9n Bilkei claimed that Cs\u00e1nyi married an unidentified lady from the S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de \u00c1kosh\u00e1za family. A possession agreement in Somogy County from 1515 preserved his sons' names: Mikl\u00f3s, Istv\u00e1n, J\u00e1nos, Gergely and \u00c1kos. Two of them Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of plague in 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}} J\u00e1nos (V) was never mentioned again.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} \u00c1kos, whose collection of 500 letters to Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy is one of the most important primary sources of the 16th-century Hungarian history, married Anna Sitkey, they had a daughter Orsolya. Later members of the Cs\u00e1nyi family descended from Mikl\u00f3s II (fl. 1500\u201341), who married L\u00facia Mar\u00e1czy.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=20}} Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi also had daughters: Margit married John H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi, as a document of 1554 from a [[Place of authentication]] recorded. His other unidentified daughter was the mother of Jakab Zele de Szentbal\u00e1zs, head of the court of Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy in [[Nagykanizsa|Kanizsa]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}}\n\nAt the county assembly of 9 December 1524, his niece Orsolya (daughter of Mikl\u00f3s I Cs\u00e1nyi and Veronika Rajki) filed a lawsuit against him for her mother's dowry and morning-gift. During the trial, the property of Cs\u00e1ny, Tilaj, Erd\u0151h\u00e1t e.g. were involved. There was a second trial in 1528 on the occasion of the [[last will and testament]] of Mikl\u00f3s I between Bal\u00e1zs and Orsolya Cs\u00e1nyi (who, by then, married G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Terj\u00e9k).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bilkei |first=Ir\u00e9n |editor1-last=Bilkei |editor1-first=Ir\u00e9n |title=Zalai \u00e9vsz\u00e1zadok.

However, Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi himself did not hold any castle.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAlongside Detre Rajki, he was referred to as \"the king's man\" in 1516 during an investigation of a suspected violation of law by Tam\u00e1s Pet\u0151 de Gerse.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In the same year, as one of the representatives of the lesser nobility (the so-called noble jurors), Cs\u00e1nyi was elected to the royal council of the young [[Louis II of Hungary]], who ascended the throne shortly before.{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Louis reaffirmed the land donations to the Cs\u00e1nyi family upon Bal\u00e1zs' request. Cs\u00e1nyi served as envoy of Zala County at the Diet of B\u00e1cs in 1518 (today [[Ba\u010d, Serbia]]). He was again mentioned as a noble juror of the royal council in 1519.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In 1520, Mikl\u00f3s Kapornay, Abbot of Zalav\u00e1r wrote in his document that Cs\u00e1nyi guaranteed the debt payment of the abbey to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Istv\u00e1n Terj\u00e9k, in exchange for the collateral of [[Zalav\u00e1r]] domain. On 3 July 1520, King Louis II commissioned Cs\u00e1nyi, among others, to investigate the report of the Buda Chapter, which complained that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kanizsai's soldiers attacked its serfs in the chapel estates of [[Zalakaros|Karos]] and [[Galambok]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} From 17 September 1520 to 1527, Cs\u00e1nyi served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County for the second (or third) time.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=252}} Meanwhile, he functioned as ''isp\u00e1n'' (or head) of the chamber of salt in [[Transylvania]] in 1523, as his own charter claimed. He held that position, when his relative, the influential Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny de Cs\u00e9b held the dignity of ''isp\u00e1n'' of chamber of salt in [[M\u00e1ramaros County|M\u00e1ramaros]] (today [[Maramure\u0219]], [[Romania]]).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\nCs\u00e1nyi did not participate in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], where his relatives, Ambrus S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny and Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny were killed. He held the office of vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County until 1527. In that year, he represented his county alongside Istv\u00e1n Gyulafi and D\u00e9nes H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi at the Diet of [[Buda]] which was convened by [[John Z\u00e1polya]].{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=241}} Following that Cs\u00e1nyi gradually retired from public life. On 1 January 1529, he bought lands in Als\u00f3kust\u00e1n from local noble L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Holl\u00f3si. A county ''dicalis'' of 1531 listed Cs\u00e1nyi's property: 12 ''porta''s in Cs\u00e1ny and 16 ''porta''s in [[Vindornyasz\u0151l\u0151s]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}} In his last years, he was ''familiar'' to the powerful [[N\u00e1dasdy family]] alongside his brother and sons. According to an undated letter of his son \u00c1kos to his lord [[Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy]], his father Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi and two of his brothers, Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of a plague which had broken out following the Ottoman campaign and the [[Siege of G\u00fcns|Siege of K\u0151szeg]] in the summer of 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}}\n\n==Family==\nBased on a document of fragmentary genealogical data from the early 16th century,{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Ir\u00e9n Bilkei claimed that Cs\u00e1nyi married an unidentified lady from the S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de \u00c1kosh\u00e1za family. A possession agreement in Somogy County from 1515 preserved his sons' names: Mikl\u00f3s, Istv\u00e1n, J\u00e1nos, Gergely and \u00c1kos. Two of them Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of plague in 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}} J\u00e1nos (V) was never mentioned again.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} \u00c1kos, whose collection of 500 letters to Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy is one of the most important primary sources of the 16th-century Hungarian history, married Anna Sitkey, they had a daughter Orsolya. Later members of the Cs\u00e1nyi family descended from Mikl\u00f3s II (fl. 1500\u201341), who married L\u00facia Mar\u00e1czy.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=20}} Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi also had daughters: Margit married John H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi, as a document of 1554 from a [[Place of authentication]] recorded. His other unidentified daughter was the mother of Jakab Zele de Szentbal\u00e1zs, head of the court of Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy in [[Nagykanizsa|Kanizsa]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}}\n\nAt the county assembly of 9 December 1524, his niece Orsolya (daughter of Mikl\u00f3s I Cs\u00e1nyi and Veronika Rajki) filed a lawsuit against him for her mother's dowry and morning-gift. During the trial, the property of Cs\u00e1ny, Tilaj, Erd\u0151h\u00e1t e.g. were involved. There was a second trial in 1528 on the occasion of the [[last will and testament]] of Mikl\u00f3s I between Bal\u00e1zs and Orsolya Cs\u00e1nyi (who, by then, married G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Terj\u00e9k).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bilkei |first=Ir\u00e9n |editor1-last=Bilkei |editor1-first=Ir\u00e9n |title=Zalai \u00e9vsz\u00e1zadok.
