(2003), p. 1.</ref> }} [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 November 1635 \u2013 3 July 1672) was a psychiatric condition in which there was a persistent false belief and preoccupation with the idea of emitting abnormal body odors which the patient thought were foul and offensive to other individuals. He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].

The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; [[cetacea]]ns; [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]]); and [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.<ref name= birkhead241>Birkhead (2018) pp. 241\u2013245.</ref><ref name=jardine307>Jardine (1999) pp. 307\u2013310.</ref><ref name=Kusukawa309>Kusukawa (2016) p. 309.</ref>\n\n===\"Insects\"===\n[[File:Megachile willughbiella male (21626826474).jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby studied this [[Megachile|leaf-cutter bee]], named by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|Kirby]] in 1802 as ''[[Megachile willughbiella]]''.|alt=a bee on a flower]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the term \"insect\" had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, ''Historia Insectorum'', included many other [[invertebrate]]s, such as worms, spiders and [[millipede]]s. It excluded [[Mollusca|molluscs]], perhaps because [[Martin Lister]], another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own ''Historia Animalium'' that covered that group. Ray's problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father's papers and possessions.<ref name= birkhead246>Birkhead (2018) pp. 246\u2013251.</ref>\n\nRay died in January 1705, and little happened with the ''Historia Insectorum'' until [[William Derham]] and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray's name only.<ref name= birkhead246/> Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research,<ref name=kusukawa336>Kusukawa (2016) pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions.<ref name=ogilvie352>Ogilvie (2016) p. 352.</ref> The book had four sections, starting with an innovative [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification system]] based on  [[metamorphosis]].<ref name= birkhead246/> The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray's observations of [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]] and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles.<ref name=ogilvie340>Ogilvie (2016) p. 340.</ref> Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.<ref name= birkhead246/>\n\n===Games and probability===\n[[File:Playingcardsvanda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby is believed to have studied [[probability]] with respect to card games.

Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers,<ref name= birkhead216>Birkhead (2018) pp. 216\u2013217.</ref> and some were based on [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow's]] oil-paintings of birds in [[Charles II of England|Charles II's]] [[aviary]] in [[St James's Park]].<ref name= birkhead227>Birkhead (2018) pp. 227\u2013228.</ref><ref name= jackson>Jackson (2006) pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nThe illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], [[Giovanni Pietro Olina|Pietro Olina]], [[Georg Marcgrave]] and [[Willem Piso]].<ref name= birkhead2016292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) pp. 292\u2013295.</ref> Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication.<ref name=flis/> In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by [[Carolus Clusius]], [[Adriaen Collaert]], [[Gervase Markham]], [[Juan Eusebio Nieremberg]] and [[Ole Worm]].<ref name= birkhead2016292/><ref name=Gurney>Gurney (1921) pp. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558/page/n220 210\u2013211]</ref> Olina's ''Ucelliera'', at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the ''Ornithology'', since the later version contains a description of [[territory (animal)|territorial]] behaviour by the [[common nightingale|nightingale]] absent from the earlier work.<ref name= birkhead2011223>Birkhead (2011) p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:FMIB 46268 Willoughby's Char.jpeg|thumb| Windermere or Willughby's charr, ''[[Salvelinus willughbii]]''|alt=Drawing of a trout-like fish]]\n\nMuch of Willughby's written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest;<ref name =birkhead89>Birkhead (2018) pp. 89\u201393.</ref><ref name=charm>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive.<ref name=charm373>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) p. 373.</ref> The ''Ornithology'' influenced [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|R\u00e9amur]] in organising his great bird collection, and [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson|Brisson]] in the compilation of his own work on the topic.

He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].
