Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide suffer from specific phobias.<ref name=\"Barker2003\"/> Sufferers typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Common phobias are flying, blood, water, highway driving, and tunnels. When people are exposed to their phobia, they may experience trembling, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|title=Phobias|last=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|date=2017|website=www.mentalhealth.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513022004/https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|archive-date=13 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> People understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger but still are overwhelmed by it.<ref>''Psychology''.

These [[panic attacks]], defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]] as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes, can last for several hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panic Disorder|url=https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|website=Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety, University of Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527074826/http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|archivedate=27 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Attacks can be triggered by stress, irrational thoughts, general fear or fear of the unknown, or even exercise. However, sometimes the trigger is unclear and the attacks can arise without warning. To help prevent an attack one can avoid the trigger. This being said not all attacks can be prevented.\n\nIn addition to recurrent unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. As such, those suffering from panic disorder experience symptoms even outside specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed by a panic sufferer, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness ([[hypervigilance]]) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme [[hypochondriasis]]).\n\n===Agoraphobia===\n{{Main|Agoraphobia}}\nAgoraphobia is the specific anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable.<ref>{{harvnb|Craske|2003}} Gorman, 2000</ref> Agoraphobia is strongly linked with [[panic disorder]] and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term [[agoraphobia]] is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that sufferers often develop.<ref>{{cite book |author1= Jane E. Fisher |author2= William T. O'Donohue |title= Practitioner's Guide to Evidence-Based Psychotherapy |date= 27 July 2006 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0387283692 |pages= 754 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> For example, following a panic attack while driving, someone suffering from agoraphobia may develop anxiety over driving and will therefore avoid driving. These avoidance behaviors can often have serious consequences and often reinforce the fear they are caused by.\n\n===Social anxiety disorder===\n{{Main|Social anxiety disorder}}\n[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD; also known as social phobia) describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This [[fear]] can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or, more typically, is experienced in most (or all) social interactions. [[Social anxiety]] often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those suffering from social anxiety often will attempt to avoid the source of their anxiety; in the case of social anxiety this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases can lead to complete social isolation.\n\nSocial physique anxiety (SPA) is a subtype of social anxiety. It is concern over the evaluation of one's body by others.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Exercise Psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199930746|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR1pAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA56}}</ref> SPA is common among adolescents, especially females.\n\n===Post-traumatic stress disorder===\n{{Main|Post-traumatic stress disorder}}\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was once an anxiety disorder (now moved to ''trauma- and stressor-related disorders'' in DSM-V) that results from a traumatic experience. Post-traumatic stress can result from an extreme situation, such as combat, natural disaster, rape, hostage situations, child abuse, bullying, or even a serious accident. It can also result from long-term (chronic) exposure to a severe stressor--<ref>{{Cite book | title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the Family | publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada | url=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/ptsd_families# | isbn=978-0-662-42627-1 | year=2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214122623/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth%2Fptsd_families | archivedate=14 February 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> for example, soldiers who endure individual battles but cannot [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with continuous combat.

It can also be caused by various events that make that particular individual uncomfortable. Its occurrence is very common. Often, an individual will experience panic attacks or extreme anxiety in specific situations. A situation that causes one individual to experience anxiety may not affect another individual at all. For example, some people become uneasy in crowds or tight spaces, so standing in a tightly packed line, say at the bank or a store register, may cause them to experience extreme anxiety, possibly a panic attack.<ref>Situational Panic Attacks.

In fact, the hormonal response to anxiety has evolved as a benefit, as it helps humans react to dangers. Researchers in [[evolutionary medicine]] believe this adaptation allows humans to realize there is a potential threat and to act accordingly in order to ensure greatest possibility of protection. It has actually been shown that those with low levels of anxiety have a greater risk of death than those with average levels. This is because the absence of fear can lead to injury or death.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, patients with both anxiety and depression were found to have lower morbidity than those with depression alone.<ref name=\"Bateson 2011 707\u2013715\">{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=M|author2=B.

For example, in the Stone Age there was greater skin-to-skin contact and more handling of babies by their mothers, both of which are strategies that reduce anxiety.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, there is greater interaction with strangers in present times as opposed to interactions solely between close-knit tribes. Researchers posit that the lack of constant social interaction, especially in the formative years, is a driving cause of high rates of anxiety.\n\nMany current cases are likely to have resulted from an [[Mismatch theory|evolutionary mismatch]], which has been specifically termed a \"psychopathogical mismatch\". In evolutionary terms, a mismatch occurs when an individual possesses traits that were adapted for an environment that differs from the individual's current environment. For example, even though an anxiety reaction may have been evolved to help with life-threatening situations, for highly sensitized individuals in Westernized cultures simply hearing bad news can elicit a strong reaction.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=John S.|title=Evolutionary aspects of anxiety disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=September 2003|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013236|pmc=3181631|pmid=22033473|doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-03354-1.50022-5}}</ref>\n\nAn evolutionary perspective may provide insight into alternatives to current clinical treatment methods for anxiety disorders. Simply knowing some anxiety is beneficial may alleviate some of the panic associated with mild conditions. Some researchers believe that, in theory, anxiety can be mediated by reducing a patient's feeling of vulnerability and then changing their appraisal of the situation.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\"/>\n\n==Mechanisms==\n===Biological===\nLow levels of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], a [[neurotransmitter]] that reduces activity in the central nervous system, contribute to anxiety.

In those with general anxiety disorder, these connections functionally seem to be less distinct, with greater [[gray matter]] in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[cingulate cortex|cingulate]] areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the [[parietal cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] circuits that underlie [[executive function]]s.<ref name=\"Etkin\"/>\n\nThe latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety.

They are prone to flare up at times of high stress and are frequently accompanied by physiological symptoms such as headache, sweating, muscle spasms, [[tachycardia]], [[palpitations]], and [[hypertension]], which in some cases lead to fatigue.\n\nIn casual discourse the words \"anxiety\" and \"fear\" are often used interchangeably; in clinical usage, they have distinct meanings: \"anxiety\" is defined as an unpleasant emotional state for which the cause is either not readily identified or perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable, whereas \"fear\" is an emotional and physiological response to a recognized external threat.<ref name=WHO2009>{{cite book|author= World Health Organization|date= 2009|title= Pharmacological Treatment of Mental Disorders in Primary Health Care|url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf|location= Geneva|isbn= 978-92-4-154769-7|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161120132530/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf|archivedate= 20 November 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The umbrella term \"anxiety disorder\" refers to a number of specific disorders that include fears (phobias) or anxiety symptoms.<ref name= DSM5/>\n\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorders is difficult because there are no objective [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]], it is based on symptoms,<ref name=\"RoseDevine2014table1\">{{cite journal| vauthors=Rose M, Devine J| title=Assessment of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety | journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 2 | pages= 197\u2013211 (Table 1) | pmid=25152658 | pmc=4140513 |type= Review }}{{open access}}</ref> which typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning.<ref name= DSM5/><ref name=Lancet2016/> Several generic anxiety questionnaires can be used to detect anxiety symptoms, such as the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] (STAI), the [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7]] (GAD-7), the [[Beck Anxiety Inventory]] (BAI), the [[Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale]], and the [[Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale]].<ref name=RoseDevine2014table1/> Other questionnaires combine anxiety and depression measurement, such as the [[Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale]], the [[Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale]] (HADS), the [[Patient Health Questionnaire]] (PHQ), and the [[Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System]] (PROMIS).<ref name=RoseDevine2014table1 /> Examples of specific anxiety questionnaires include the [[Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale]] (LSAS), the [[Social Interaction Anxiety Scale]] (SIAS), the [[Social Phobia Inventory]] (SPIN), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and the Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ-A30).<ref name=RoseDevine2014table2>{{cite journal| vauthors=Rose M, Devine J| title=Assessment of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety | journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 2 | pages= 197\u2013211 (Table 2) | pmid=25152658 | pmc=4140513 |type= Review }}{{open access}}</ref>\n\nAnxiety disorders often occur along with other mental disorders, in particular [[depression (mood)|depression]], which may occur in as many as 60% of people with anxiety disorders.

Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide suffer from specific phobias.<ref name=\"Barker2003\"/> Sufferers typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Common phobias are flying, blood, water, highway driving, and tunnels. When people are exposed to their phobia, they may experience trembling, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|title=Phobias|last=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|date=2017|website=www.mentalhealth.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513022004/https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|archive-date=13 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> People understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger but still are overwhelmed by it.<ref>''Psychology''.

These [[panic attacks]], defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]] as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes, can last for several hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panic Disorder|url=https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|website=Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety, University of Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527074826/http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|archivedate=27 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Attacks can be triggered by stress, irrational thoughts, general fear or fear of the unknown, or even exercise. However, sometimes the trigger is unclear and the attacks can arise without warning. To help prevent an attack one can avoid the trigger. This being said not all attacks can be prevented.\n\nIn addition to recurrent unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. As such, those suffering from panic disorder experience symptoms even outside specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed by a panic sufferer, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness ([[hypervigilance]]) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme [[hypochondriasis]]).\n\n===Agoraphobia===\n{{Main|Agoraphobia}}\nAgoraphobia is the specific anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable.<ref>{{harvnb|Craske|2003}} Gorman, 2000</ref> Agoraphobia is strongly linked with [[panic disorder]] and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term [[agoraphobia]] is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that sufferers often develop.<ref>{{cite book |author1= Jane E. Fisher |author2= William T.

These avoidance behaviors can often have serious consequences and often reinforce the fear they are caused by.\n\n===Social anxiety disorder===\n{{Main|Social anxiety disorder}}\n[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD; also known as social phobia) describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This [[fear]] can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or, more typically, is experienced in most (or all) social interactions. [[Social anxiety]] often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those suffering from social anxiety often will attempt to avoid the source of their anxiety; in the case of social anxiety this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases can lead to complete social isolation.\n\nSocial physique anxiety (SPA) is a subtype of social anxiety. It is concern over the evaluation of one's body by others.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Exercise Psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199930746|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR1pAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA56}}</ref> SPA is common among adolescents, especially females.\n\n===Post-traumatic stress disorder===\n{{Main|Post-traumatic stress disorder}}\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was once an anxiety disorder (now moved to ''trauma- and stressor-related disorders'' in DSM-V) that results from a traumatic experience.

It can also be caused by various events that make that particular individual uncomfortable. Its occurrence is very common. Often, an individual will experience panic attacks or extreme anxiety in specific situations. A situation that causes one individual to experience anxiety may not affect another individual at all. For example, some people become uneasy in crowds or tight spaces, so standing in a tightly packed line, say at the bank or a store register, may cause them to experience extreme anxiety, possibly a panic attack.<ref>Situational Panic Attacks.

People with these disorders have highly sensitive systems; hence, their systems tend to overreact to seemingly harmless stimuli.

In fact, the hormonal response to anxiety has evolved as a benefit, as it helps humans react to dangers. Researchers in [[evolutionary medicine]] believe this adaptation allows humans to realize there is a potential threat and to act accordingly in order to ensure greatest possibility of protection. It has actually been shown that those with low levels of anxiety have a greater risk of death than those with average levels. This is because the absence of fear can lead to injury or death.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, patients with both anxiety and depression were found to have lower morbidity than those with depression alone.<ref name=\"Bateson 2011 707\u2013715\">{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=M|author2=B.

For example, in the Stone Age there was greater skin-to-skin contact and more handling of babies by their mothers, both of which are strategies that reduce anxiety.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, there is greater interaction with strangers in present times as opposed to interactions solely between close-knit tribes. Researchers posit that the lack of constant social interaction, especially in the formative years, is a driving cause of high rates of anxiety.\n\nMany current cases are likely to have resulted from an [[Mismatch theory|evolutionary mismatch]], which has been specifically termed a \"psychopathogical mismatch\". In evolutionary terms, a mismatch occurs when an individual possesses traits that were adapted for an environment that differs from the individual's current environment. For example, even though an anxiety reaction may have been evolved to help with life-threatening situations, for highly sensitized individuals in Westernized cultures simply hearing bad news can elicit a strong reaction.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=John S.|title=Evolutionary aspects of anxiety disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=September 2003|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013236|pmc=3181631|pmid=22033473|doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-03354-1.50022-5}}</ref>\n\nAn evolutionary perspective may provide insight into alternatives to current clinical treatment methods for anxiety disorders. Simply knowing some anxiety is beneficial may alleviate some of the panic associated with mild conditions. Some researchers believe that, in theory, anxiety can be mediated by reducing a patient's feeling of vulnerability and then changing their appraisal of the situation.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\"/>\n\n==Mechanisms==\n===Biological===\nLow levels of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], a [[neurotransmitter]] that reduces activity in the central nervous system, contribute to anxiety.

The basolateral complex processes sensory-related fear memories and communicates their threat importance to memory and [[sensory processing]] elsewhere in the brain, such as the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and sensory cortices.\n\nAnother important area is the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala, which controls species-specific fear responses, via connections to the [[brainstem]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[cerebellum]] areas. In those with general anxiety disorder, these connections functionally seem to be less distinct, with greater [[gray matter]] in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[cingulate cortex|cingulate]] areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the [[parietal cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] circuits that underlie [[executive function]]s.<ref name=\"Etkin\"/>\n\nThe latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety.
