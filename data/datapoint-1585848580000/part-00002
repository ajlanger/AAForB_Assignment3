He participated in various battles and campaigns throughout the [[Pacific War]] and was eventually shot down and killed over [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]] on 24 November 1944.\n\n==Early career==\nAyao Shirane enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1933 and graduated from 64th class in March 1937. He completed an aerial training program and became a fighter pilot in March 1939. He was assigned to 12th Air Group in [[Central China]] in September and on 19 August 1940 participated [[Bombing of Chongqing]]. It was the first time the new [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters were used in a combat mission, however no aerial opposition was encountered on that day. On September 13, he was one of the 13 A6M Zeros that were led to [[Hankow]] by Sabur\u014d Shindo, where in the aerial battle IJN pilots managed to claim 27 enemy fighters shot down without suffering any losses. Even though this was [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|Lieutenant (jg)]] Shirane's first aerial combat, he managed to shot down one of the enemy fighters. He was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in May 1941.\n\n==Pacific War==\nAt the start of Pacific War, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and participated in several early battles, including [[Attack on Darwin]] and [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was eventually appointed flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) of ''Akagi'''s fighter squadron. He participated in [[Battle of Midway]] and on 4 June 1942 led a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) that engaged [[United States Navy]] (USN) torpedo bombers. Nevertheless, his carrier was attacked and sank by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers.\n\nIn July 1942, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] and became its fighter squadron leader. In late October 1942, he participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. He led nine A6M Zeros that escorted the second wave strike on USN carriers, consisting of 27 [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers under the command of Lieutenant [[Sadamu Takahashi]] (''Zuikaku'' dive bomber squadron leader and [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]). They however could not locate the enemy carriers since Takahashi failed to receive the report on updated position of USN fleet. Nevertheless, carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' was badly damaged by the first wave strike commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Mamoru Seki]], which included his academy classmate Lieutenant [[Keiichi Arima]] who led one of the dive bomber divisions.\n\nIn late October 1942, Lieutenant Shirane participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. He led eight A6M Zero fighters to escort the first strike wave on USN carriers, which consisted of 21 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 20 [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers and was under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Shigeharu Murata]]. His fighter group was involved in intense aerial combat over the USN fleet, where they shot down several [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters and in return lost several of their own Zeros. After USN strikes damaged carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuih\u014d'']], remaining ''Zuikaku'' and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']] launched follow-up strikes against USN carriers. Shirane again led Zeros to escort the bombers.\n\nOn 1 November 1943, Shirane was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and was transferred to 341st Air Group, which operated the new [[Kawanishi N1K]] fighters. On 24 November, he was shot down and killed over [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]] while he was engaged in a combat with [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] fighters.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n*{{cite book |last       = Hata\n |first      = Ikuhiko\n |author2    = Yasuho Izawa\n |author3    = Christopher Shores\n |year       = 2011\n |title      = Japanese Naval Air Force Fighter Units and their aces, 1932-1945.\n |publisher  = Grub Street\n |location   = London, UK\n |isbn       = 9781906502843\n}}\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Lundstrom\n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=The First Team: Pacific Naval Air Combat from Pearl Harbor to Midway \n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-471-X\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shirane, Ayao}}\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Japanese World War II flying aces]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:1944 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name= Ayao Shirane\n|birth_date=1916\n|death_date={{death date|df=y|1944|11|24}}\n|birth_place= [[Tokyo]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place= [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]]\n|image=Ayao Shirane.jpg\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Commander]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12st Air Group<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Darwin]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Shirane}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ayao Shirane'''|\u767d\u6839 \u6590\u592b|Shirane Ayao}} was a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].
