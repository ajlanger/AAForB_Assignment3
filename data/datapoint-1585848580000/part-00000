{"title_page": "Geochronology", "text_new": "{{short description|Science of determining the age of rocks, sediments and fossils}}\n[[Image:Geological time spiral.png|thumb|right|300px|An artistic depiction of the major events in the history of Earth]]\n\n'''Geochronology''' is the [[science]] of [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[fossil]]s, and [[sediment]]s using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves. Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through [[radioactive isotopes]], whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as [[palaeomagnetism]] and [[stable isotope ratio]]s. By combining multiple geochronological (and [[biostratigraphic]]) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.\n\nGeochronology is different in application from biostratigraphy, which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period via describing, cataloging and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages. Biostratigraphy does not ''directly'' provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an ''interval'' of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted. Both disciplines work together hand in hand, however, to the point where they share the same system of naming [[strata]] (rock layers) and the time spans utilized to classify sublayers within a stratum.\n\nThe science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of [[chronostratigraphy]], which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages and determine the geologic [[history of the Earth]] and [[List of Solar System objects by size|extraterrestrial bodies]].\n\n== Dating methods ==\n{{Geology to Paleobiology}}\n\n=== Radiometric dating ===\n{{main|Radiometric dating}}\nBy measuring the amount of [[radioactive decay]] of a [[radioactive isotope]] with a known [[half-life]], geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon method]], most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a [[radiogenic]] isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope.<ref>Dickin, A.

This technique measures the ratio of two lead [[isotope]]s (lead-206 and lead-207) to the amount of uranium in a mineral or rock. Often applied to the trace mineral [[zircon]] in [[igneous rock]]s, this method is one of the two most commonly used (along with [[argon\u2013argon dating]]) for geologic dating. [[Monazite geochronology]] is another example of U\u2013Pb dating, employed for dating metamorphism in particular.

This technique is used to date [[speleothem]]s, [[coral]]s, [[carbonate]]s, and fossil [[bone]]s. Its range is from a few years to about 700,000 years.\n* [[Potassium\u2013argon dating]] and [[argon\u2013argon dating]]. These techniques date [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[volcanic rock|volcanic]] rocks.

Exposure dating uses the concentration of exotic nuclides (e.g. <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, <sup>36</sup>Cl) produced by cosmic rays interacting with Earth materials as a proxy for the age at which a surface, such as an alluvial fan, was created. Burial dating uses the differential radioactive decay of 2 cosmogenic elements as a proxy for the age at which a sediment was screened by burial from further cosmic rays exposure.\n\n=== Luminescence dating ===\nLuminescence dating techniques observe 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite. Many types of luminescence techniques are utilized in geology, including [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), [[cathodoluminescence]] (CL), and [[thermoluminescence]] (TL).

For paleomagnetic dating, it is suggested to use the APWP in order to date a pole obtained from rocks or sediments of unknown age by linking the paleopole to the nearest point on the APWP.
