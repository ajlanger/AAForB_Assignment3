P. Franklin (aka [[Stan Franklin]]) in 1965, who was investigating the question of \"what are the classes of topological spaces that can be specified completely by the knowledge of their convergent sequences?\" Franklin arrived at the definition above by noting that every [[first-countable space]] can be specified completely by the knowledge of its convergent sequences, and then he abstracted properties of first countable spaces that allowed this to be true.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery [[first-countable space]] is sequential, hence each [[second-countable space]], [[metric space]], and [[discrete space]] is sequential. Further examples are furnished by applying the categorical properties listed below. For example, every [[CW-complex]] is sequential, as it can be considered as a quotient of a metric space.\n\nThere are sequential spaces that are not first countable. (One example is to take the real line '''R''' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] the set '''Z''' of integers to a point.)\n\nAn example of a space that is ''not'' sequential is the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the cocountable topology is not [[discrete space|discrete]]. In fact, one could say that the cocountable topology on an uncountable set is \"sequentially discrete\".\n\n== Equivalent conditions ==\n\nMany conditions have been shown{{cn|date=June 2015}} to be equivalent to X being sequential. Here are a few:\n\n*''X'' is the quotient of a first countable space.\n*''X'' is the quotient of a metric space.\n*For every topological space ''Y'' and every map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'', we have that ''f'' is [[continuous (topology)|continuous]] if and only if for every sequence of points (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converging to ''x'', we have (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converging to ''f''(''x'').\n\nThe final equivalent condition shows that the class of sequential spaces consists precisely of those spaces whose topological structure is determined by convergent sequences in the space.\n\n== Categorical properties ==\n\nThe [[full subcategory]] '''Seq''' of all sequential spaces is closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Quotients\n* Continuous closed or open images\n* Sums\n* Inductive limits\n* Open and closed subspaces\n\nThe category '''Seq''' is ''not'' closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Continuous images\n* Subspaces\n* Finite products\n\nSince they are closed under topological sums and quotients, the sequential spaces form a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the [[category of topological spaces]]. In fact, they are the coreflective hull of [[metrizable space]]s (i.e., the smallest class of topological spaces closed under sums and quotients and containing the metrizable spaces).\n\nThe subcategory '''Seq''' is a [[Cartesian closed category]] with respect to its own product (not that of '''Top'''). The [[exponential object]]s are equipped with the (convergent sequence)-open topology. P.I. Booth and A. Tillotson have shown that '''Seq''' is the smallest Cartesian closed subcategory of '''Top''' containing the underlying topological spaces of all [[metric space]]s, [[CW-complex]]es, and [[differentiable manifold]]s and that is closed under colimits, quotients, and other \"certain reasonable identities\" that [[Norman Steenrod]] described as \"convenient\".\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Axioms of countability]]\n*[[First-countable space]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin, L.S., ''General Topology I'', Springer-Verlag, New York (1990) {{isbn|3-540-18178-4}}.\n*Booth, P.I. and Tillotson, A., ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102779712 Monoidal closed, cartesian closed and convenient categories of topological spaces]'' Pacific J.

A space is a Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Urysohn space if and only if every subspace is a sequential space. Every [[first-countable space]] is a Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Urysohn space.\n\nThe space is named after [[Maurice Fr\u00e9chet]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]].\n\nClearly, every Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Urysohn space is a sequential space. The opposite implication is not true in general.<ref>Engelking 1989, Example 1.6.18</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Dan|title=A note about the Arens\u2019 space|url=http://dantopology.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/a-note-about-the-arens-space/|accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nA topological space <math>X</math> is a '''strong Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Urysohn space''' if for every point <math>x\\in X</math> and every sequence <math>A_1,A_2,\\ldots</math> of subsets of the space <math>X</math> such that <math>x\\in\\bigcap_n\\overline{A_n}</math> , there are points <math>x_1\\in A_1, x_2\\in A_2,\\ldots</math> such that <math>\\{x_n\\}\\to x</math>.\n\nThe above properties can be expressed as [[selection principle|selection principles]].\n\n== History ==\n\nAlthough spaces satisfying such properties had implicitly been studied for several years, the first formal definition is originally due to S. P. Franklin (aka [[Stan Franklin]]) in 1965, who was investigating the question of \"what are the classes of topological spaces that can be specified completely by the knowledge of their convergent sequences?\" Franklin arrived at the definition above by noting that every [[first-countable space]] can be specified completely by the knowledge of its convergent sequences, and then he abstracted properties of first countable spaces that allowed this to be true.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery [[first-countable space]] is sequential, hence each [[second-countable space]], [[metric space]], and [[discrete space]] is sequential. Further examples are furnished by applying the categorical properties listed below. For example, every [[CW-complex]] is sequential, as it can be considered as a quotient of a metric space.\n\nThere are sequential spaces that are not first countable. (One example is to take the real line '''R''' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] the set '''Z''' of integers to a point.)\n\nAn example of a space that is ''not'' sequential is the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the cocountable topology is not [[discrete space|discrete]]. In fact, one could say that the cocountable topology on an uncountable set is \"sequentially discrete\".\n\n== Equivalent conditions ==\n\nMany conditions have been shown{{cn|date=June 2015}} to be equivalent to X being sequential. Here are a few:\n\n*''X'' is the quotient of a first countable space.\n*''X'' is the quotient of a metric space.\n*For every topological space ''Y'' and every map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'', we have that ''f'' is [[continuous (topology)|continuous]] if and only if for every sequence of points (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converging to ''x'', we have (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converging to ''f''(''x'').\n\nThe final equivalent condition shows that the class of sequential spaces consists precisely of those spaces whose topological structure is determined by convergent sequences in the space.\n\n== Categorical properties ==\n\nThe [[full subcategory]] '''Seq''' of all sequential spaces is closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Quotients\n* Continuous closed or open images\n* Sums\n* Inductive limits\n* Open and closed subspaces\n\nThe category '''Seq''' is ''not'' closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Continuous images\n* Subspaces\n* Finite products\n\nSince they are closed under topological sums and quotients, the sequential spaces form a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the [[category of topological spaces]]. In fact, they are the coreflective hull of [[metrizable space]]s (i.e., the smallest class of topological spaces closed under sums and quotients and containing the metrizable spaces).\n\nThe subcategory '''Seq''' is a [[Cartesian closed category]] with respect to its own product (not that of '''Top'''). The [[exponential object]]s are equipped with the (convergent sequence)-open topology. P.I. Booth and A. Tillotson have shown that '''Seq''' is the smallest Cartesian closed subcategory of '''Top''' containing the underlying topological spaces of all [[metric space]]s, [[CW-complex]]es, and [[differentiable manifold]]s and that is closed under colimits, quotients, and other \"certain reasonable identities\" that [[Norman Steenrod]] described as \"convenient\".\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Axioms of countability]]\n*[[First-countable space]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin, L.S., ''General Topology I'', Springer-Verlag, New York (1990) {{isbn|3-540-18178-4}}.\n*Booth, P.I. and Tillotson, A., ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102779712 Monoidal closed, cartesian closed and convenient categories of topological spaces]'' Pacific J.
