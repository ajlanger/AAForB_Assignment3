He made 269 appearances in the [[Premier League]], including 130 for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He is the manager of {{English football updater|FleetwoT}} club [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]].\n\nBarton was born and raised in [[Huyton]], Merseyside. He began his football career with Manchester City in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the first team gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his only [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for the [[England national football team|England national team]] in February 2007, despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a fee of \u00a35.8&nbsp;million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in August 2011, from where he was loaned to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 2012. He returned from his loan spell the following season, and helped QPR to promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs. However, QPR were relegated again, and Barton was released at the end of the season. He signed a one-year deal to play for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 2015, helping them win promotion to the Premier League, but left to join [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in May 2016. He was banned from football after admitting a [[The Football Association|Football Association]] charge relating to betting in April 2017, and upon its expiration in June 2018 commenced his managerial career with Fleetwood Town.\n\nBarton's career and life have been marked by numerous controversial incidents and disciplinary problems<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/newcastle-united-fc/player-profile/3601/joeybarton.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122033442/http://www.4thegame.com/club/newcastle-united-fc/player-profile/3601/joeybarton.html |archivedate=22 January 2009 |title=4thegame Profile |publisher=4thegame.com |accessdate=13 July 2007}}</ref> and he has been convicted twice on charges of violence.

He made 269 appearances in the [[Premier League]], including 130 for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He is the manager of {{English football updater|FleetwoT}} club [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]].\n\nBarton was born and raised in [[Huyton]], Merseyside. He began his football career with Manchester City in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the first team gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his only [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for the [[England national football team|England national team]] in February 2007, despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a fee of \u00a35.8&nbsp;million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in August 2011, from where he was loaned to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 2012. He returned from his loan spell the following season, and helped QPR to promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs. However, QPR were relegated again, and Barton was released at the end of the season. He signed a one-year deal to play for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 2015, helping them win promotion to the Premier League, but left to join [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in May 2016. He was banned from football after admitting a [[The Football Association|Football Association]] charge relating to betting in April 2017, and upon its expiration in June 2018 commenced his managerial career with Fleetwood Town.\n\nBarton's career and life have been marked by numerous controversial incidents and disciplinary problems<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/newcastle-united-fc/player-profile/3601/joeybarton.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122033442/http://www.4thegame.com/club/newcastle-united-fc/player-profile/3601/joeybarton.html |archivedate=22 January 2009 |title=4thegame Profile |publisher=4thegame.com |accessdate=13 July 2007}}</ref> and he has been convicted twice on charges of violence.
