During a period of religious unrest in the town, theological tensions within [[Anglicanism]] between [[High church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Low church]] Anglicans were inflamed by what the latter group saw as the church's \"idolatrous\" Roman Catholic-style fittings\u2014in particular, a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] which was seized upon by opponents as an example of a reversion to Catholic-style worship in the [[Church of England]].  The \"Worthing Madonna\" dispute<ref name=\"Hare158\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=158.}}</ref> delayed the consecration of the church by several years.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade C for its architectural and historical importance, and the adjacent [[vestry]] and [[vicarage]] are listed separately at Grade II.\n\n==History==\nWorthing experienced fitful but often rapid growth throughout the 19th century after it became established as a town and seaside resort at the start of the 19th century.  Between 1801, two years before an [[Act of Parliament]] gave it the status of a town, and 1881, the population increased from about 2,000 to 14,000.<ref name=\"WAPH-Intro\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=Introduction.}}</ref><ref name=\"VOB-Worthing\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056524&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Worthing through time: Population Statistics: Total Population|year=2009|work=Vision of Britain website|publisher=[[Great Britain Historical GIS]]|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>  The era coincided with a revival in Anglican Christian worship: this was especially marked in [[Brighton]], Worthing's larger and more illustrious rival resort further along the Sussex coast, whose vicar [[Arthur Wagner]] funded and built many churches across the town.<ref name=\"EncB150\">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=\u00a7150.}}</ref>\n\nSussex was a religiously conservative county,<ref name=\"Hare60\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=60.}}</ref> and by the middle of the 19th century\u2014after the [[Catholic Emancipation]]\u2014serious disputes arose between traditionalist [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Anglicans, who regarded Catholic-style worship with suspicion, and the newly emerging [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] practices of Anglicans who were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]] (Tractarianism) of practitioners such as [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] and [[John Keble]].  The disagreements were again focused on Brighton,<ref name=\"EncB150\"/> but ill-feeling had spread to Worthing by the 1850s.  The town had a long tradition of riotous bonfire parades,<ref name=\"Hare52\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=52.}}</ref> and the \"Bonfire Boys\" started to focus their attention on Roman Catholics and Tractarians.

George Wedd, the owner of Charmandean House (a large [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house, now demolished),<ref name=\"MEWH46\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|p=46.}}</ref> was the main promoter of the scheme, and he found and bought some land in 1881 in an area which had seen recent residential development.<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\"/>  He also provided much of the funding for the construction, and [[Arthur Blomfield]] was contracted to design and build the church.  Preparation work started in 1882, the [[foundation stone]] was laid on 13 June 1885,<ref name=\"Greenwood1\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=1.}}</ref> and building work continued until 1886.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"WAOC54\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1985|loc=\u00a754}}</ref><ref name=\"WAPH151\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=\u00a7151.}}</ref>  Disagreements had already begun in November 1882, when the Worthing Town Commissioners sought permission to take territory from the parishes of several other churches in the town\u2014[[St. Mary's Church, Broadwater|St Mary's]], [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]] and Holy Trinity\u2014and form a new parish for St Andrew's Church.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Account32\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=32.}}</ref>  The clergy of the three churches opposed the proposal, arguing that their parishes were not \"large in extent and population, and insufficiently supplied with ministers and church accommodation\" as stipulated in the terms of the proposal.<ref name=\"Account32\"/>  It was argued that the site for St Andrew's Church was in the part of Worthing where the highest concentration of churches already existed: it would be the ninth Anglican church or mission hall in an area of {{convert|1|sqmi|sqkm}} encompassing central Worthing and [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]].<ref name=\"Account35\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=35.}}</ref>\n\nAs debate over this issue continued, more controversy erupted when in late 1886, as the church was being completed, it was discovered that a [[Lady chapel]] with a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]] had been included in the design.<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  To opponents of Anglo-Catholic worship, the representation in statue form of [[Jesus]]'s mother symbolised a return to the practices that the [[English Reformation]] had sought to end: it was claimed that [[idolatry]] and [[ritualism]] would be encouraged and Anglican churches would start to be decorated in the same manner as [[Roman Catholic]] places of worship.<ref name=\"Hare158\u2013159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|pp=158\u2013159.}}</ref>  The statue was soon referred to as the \"Worthing [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]\",<ref name=\"Hare158\"/><ref name=\"Account36\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=36.}}</ref> and became the focus of the ill-feeling around the church: one writer, chronicling the day of the consecration, started his account by referring to the \"peculiarly obnoxious Madonna\".<ref name=\"Account36\"/>\n\nThe consecration of the church, set for 1886, was postponed because of the strength of feeling in Worthing (and possibly in an attempt to prevent religious riots similar to those of the [[Skeleton Army]] two years previously).<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  The vicar of the Holy Trinity, other Worthing vicars, a local army [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] and the local [[magistrate]] were among a group of people who presented a petition to the [[Bishop of Chichester]] asking for the consecration to be stopped,<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Hare159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=159.}}</ref> arguing that the Madonna was \"at variance with the spirit and teaching of our Reformed church\".<ref name=\"Hare159\"/>  The Bishop, [[Richard Durnford]], held out against the protests, cautioning against the disrespectful use of the term \"Madonna\" and recommending that the group's grievances be taken to a higher court.<ref name=\"Hare160\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=160.}}</ref>  The consecration was eventually scheduled for 1888, two years after the church was finished; a final appeal to the [[House of Lords]] was unsuccessful,<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/> and the ceremony was held on 1 August 1888 by Bishop Durnford.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/><ref name=\"Account36\"/>  The first public service had been held on 27 May 1888.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nThe ill-feeling between Anglo-Catholics and their opponents soon died down, apart from some brief controversy in the mid-1890s over some fittings in [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]].<ref name=\"Hare160\"/>  After [[World War I]], there was a further brief dispute over the design of a war memorial in St Andrew's Church, which took the form of a [[shrine]] depicting the [[Crucifixion]] designed by Charles Eamer Kempe.  It was installed in 1919.  The names of local war dead were inscribed on the a panel on the chancel wall.<ref name=\"MEWH138\u2013139\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|pp=138\u2013139.}}</ref>\n\nSince its opening, the exterior of St Andrew's Church has experienced little change, and there have been only gradual increases in the decoration of the interior.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>  A new marble altar was placed in the chancel in 1902, one year after a wooden altar was added in the Lady chapel.  A [[rood screen]], carved in oak, and walnut-wood [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]] were added in 1905 (the latter were replaced by oak stalls in 1932).  Another altar, this time in the south transept, was installed in 1922.  The red [[alabaster]] piece was designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]].  A green marble altar was donated to the church in 1950 and was placed in the north transept.<ref name=\"Greenwood3\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=3.}}</ref>  Work undertaken in the 1970s included the painting of the internal brickwork and the creation of a glass-walled memorial to a former vicar.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nLike many 19th-century churches in Worthing, St Andrew's established a mission hall as the population of Anglican worshippers grew.  The building, in Victoria Road, was founded in about 1900 but has since been demolished.<ref name=\"WAPH-Intro\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt1/pp119-122|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1: Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

Scenes portrayed include the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]], the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[John the Evangelist]], [[John the Baptist]] and several other saints, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the [[Apostle (Christian)|Twelve Apostles]].<ref name=\"Greenwood5\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=5.}}</ref>  In addition, one of Kempe's earliest known windows\u2014designed for All Souls Church in Brighton and depicting [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Martha]] and the [[Four Evangelists]]\u2014was retrieved from that church when it was demolished in the 1960s,<ref name=\"PoW6\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=6.}}</ref> and was installed in the sacristy.<ref name=\"Greenwood5\"/>\n\n==Vestry and vicarage==\nThe former vestry was added to the church in a matching style in 1908\u20139 by T.R.

During a period of religious unrest in the town, theological tensions within [[Anglicanism]] between [[High church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Low church]] Anglicans were inflamed by what the latter group saw as the church's \"idolatrous\" Roman Catholic-style fittings\u2014in particular, a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] which was seized upon by opponents as an example of a reversion to Catholic-style worship in the [[Church of England]].  The \"Worthing Madonna\" dispute<ref name=\"Hare158\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=158.}}</ref> delayed the consecration of the church by several years.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade C for its architectural and historical importance, and the adjacent [[vestry]] and [[vicarage]] are listed separately at Grade II.\n\n==History==\nWorthing experienced fitful but often rapid growth throughout the 19th century after it became established as a town and seaside resort at the start of the 19th century.  Between 1801, two years before an [[Act of Parliament]] gave it the status of a town, and 1881, the population increased from about 2,000 to 14,000.<ref name=\"WAPH-Intro\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=Introduction.}}</ref><ref name=\"VOB-Worthing\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056524&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Worthing through time: Population Statistics: Total Population|year=2009|work=Vision of Britain website|publisher=[[Great Britain Historical GIS]]|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>  The era coincided with a revival in Anglican Christian worship: this was especially marked in [[Brighton]], Worthing's larger and more illustrious rival resort further along the Sussex coast, whose vicar [[Arthur Wagner]] funded and built many churches across the town.<ref name=\"EncB150\">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=\u00a7150.}}</ref>\n\nSussex was a religiously conservative county,<ref name=\"Hare60\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=60.}}</ref> and by the middle of the 19th century\u2014after the [[Catholic Emancipation]]\u2014serious disputes arose between traditionalist [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Anglicans, who regarded Catholic-style worship with suspicion, and the newly emerging [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] practices of Anglicans who were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]] (Tractarianism) of practitioners such as [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] and [[John Keble]].  The disagreements were again focused on Brighton,<ref name=\"EncB150\"/> but ill-feeling had spread to Worthing by the 1850s.  The town had a long tradition of riotous bonfire parades,<ref name=\"Hare52\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=52.}}</ref> and the \"Bonfire Boys\" started to focus their attention on Roman Catholics and Tractarians.  [[Effigy|Effigies]] of [[John Henry Newman]] and an unidentified Tractarian were burnt in 1853 and 1859 respectively;<ref name=\"Hare59\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=59.}}</ref> clergymen who had Tractarian beliefs were considered to be traitors to the Protestant cause.<ref name=\"Hare60\"/>\n\nOther groups\u2014including the police, wealthy residents and the [[Salvation Army]]\u2014became the Bonfire Boys' target later in the century; this culminated in the [[Skeleton Army]] riots of the 1880s, when Worthing's newly established Salvation Army was violently opposed.<ref name=\"Hare61\u201362\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|pp=61\u201362.}}</ref><ref name=\"Hare67\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=67.}}</ref>  The Roman Catholic community became accepted, and anti-Tractarian feeling briefly receded.<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>\n\nIn the early 1880s, a group of [[High church]], Anglo-Catholic Anglicans sought to establish a church of that character in central Worthing.  George Wedd, the owner of Charmandean House (a large [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house, now demolished),<ref name=\"MEWH46\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|p=46.}}</ref> was the main promoter of the scheme, and he found and bought some land in 1881 in an area which had seen recent residential development.<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\"/>  He also provided much of the funding for the construction, and [[Arthur Blomfield]] was contracted to design and build the church.  Preparation work started in 1882, the [[foundation stone]] was laid on 13 June 1885,<ref name=\"Greenwood1\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=1.}}</ref> and building work continued until 1886.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"WAOC54\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1985|loc=\u00a754}}</ref><ref name=\"WAPH151\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=\u00a7151.}}</ref>  Disagreements had already begun in November 1882, when the Worthing Town Commissioners sought permission to take territory from the parishes of several other churches in the town\u2014[[St. Mary's Church, Broadwater|St Mary's]], [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]] and Holy Trinity\u2014and form a new parish for St Andrew's Church.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Account32\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=32.}}</ref>  The clergy of the three churches opposed the proposal, arguing that their parishes were not \"large in extent and population, and insufficiently supplied with ministers and church accommodation\" as stipulated in the terms of the proposal.<ref name=\"Account32\"/>  It was argued that the site for St Andrew's Church was in the part of Worthing where the highest concentration of churches already existed: it would be the ninth Anglican church or mission hall in an area of {{convert|1|sqmi|sqkm}} encompassing central Worthing and [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]].<ref name=\"Account35\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=35.}}</ref>\n\nAs debate over this issue continued, more controversy erupted when in late 1886, as the church was being completed, it was discovered that a [[Lady chapel]] with a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]] had been included in the design.<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  To opponents of Anglo-Catholic worship, the representation in statue form of [[Jesus]]'s mother symbolised a return to the practices that the [[English Reformation]] had sought to end: it was claimed that [[idolatry]] and [[ritualism]] would be encouraged and Anglican churches would start to be decorated in the same manner as [[Roman Catholic]] places of worship.<ref name=\"Hare158\u2013159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|pp=158\u2013159.}}</ref>  The statue was soon referred to as the \"Worthing [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]\",<ref name=\"Hare158\"/><ref name=\"Account36\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=36.}}</ref> and became the focus of the ill-feeling around the church: one writer, chronicling the day of the consecration, started his account by referring to the \"peculiarly obnoxious Madonna\".<ref name=\"Account36\"/>\n\nThe consecration of the church, set for 1886, was postponed because of the strength of feeling in Worthing (and possibly in an attempt to prevent religious riots similar to those of the [[Skeleton Army]] two years previously).<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  The vicar of the Holy Trinity, other Worthing vicars, a local army [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] and the local [[magistrate]] were among a group of people who presented a petition to the [[Bishop of Chichester]] asking for the consecration to be stopped,<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Hare159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=159.}}</ref> arguing that the Madonna was \"at variance with the spirit and teaching of our Reformed church\".<ref name=\"Hare159\"/>  The Bishop, [[Richard Durnford]], held out against the protests, cautioning against the disrespectful use of the term \"Madonna\" and recommending that the group's grievances be taken to a higher court.<ref name=\"Hare160\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=160.}}</ref>  The consecration was eventually scheduled for 1888, two years after the church was finished; a final appeal to the [[House of Lords]] was unsuccessful,<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/> and the ceremony was held on 1 August 1888 by Bishop Durnford.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/><ref name=\"Account36\"/>  The first public service had been held on 27 May 1888.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nThe ill-feeling between Anglo-Catholics and their opponents soon died down, apart from some brief controversy in the mid-1890s over some fittings in [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]].<ref name=\"Hare160\"/>  After [[World War I]], there was a further brief dispute over the design of a war memorial in St Andrew's Church, which took the form of a [[shrine]] depicting the [[Crucifixion]] designed by Charles Eamer Kempe.  It was installed in 1919.  The names of local war dead were inscribed on the a panel on the chancel wall.<ref name=\"MEWH138\u2013139\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|pp=138\u2013139.}}</ref>\n\nSince its opening, the exterior of St Andrew's Church has experienced little change, and there have been only gradual increases in the decoration of the interior.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>  A new marble altar was placed in the chancel in 1902, one year after a wooden altar was added in the Lady chapel.  A [[rood screen]], carved in oak, and walnut-wood [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]] were added in 1905 (the latter were replaced by oak stalls in 1932).  Another altar, this time in the south transept, was installed in 1922.  The red [[alabaster]] piece was designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]].  A green marble altar was donated to the church in 1950 and was placed in the north transept.<ref name=\"Greenwood3\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=3.}}</ref>  Work undertaken in the 1970s included the painting of the internal brickwork and the creation of a glass-walled memorial to a former vicar.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nLike many 19th-century churches in Worthing, St Andrew's established a mission hall as the population of Anglican worshippers grew.  The building, in Victoria Road, was founded in about 1900 but has since been demolished.<ref name=\"WAPH-Intro\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt1/pp119-122|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1: Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

[[Charles Eamer Kempe]] provided most of the [[stained glass]] and an intricately carved wooden [[reredos]].<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"IoE433061\"/>  The \"Worthing Madonna\" represents the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus, stands in a recess in the apse of the Lady chapel, and was executed in [[Caen stone]] by sculptor [[Harry Hems]] of [[Exeter]], Devon.  The stone has a gold and dark red mosaic-style border.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/><ref name=\"PoW57\"/>  Hems also made the [[Baptismal font|font]], a stone structure in the baptistery, although Arthur Blomfield drew up the design.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nKempe's stained glass is extensive: all but four windows in the church feature his designs, and these exceptions were the work of his cousin and collaborator Walter Tower.  Scenes portrayed include the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]], the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[John the Evangelist]], [[John the Baptist]] and several other saints, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the [[Apostle (Christian)|Twelve Apostles]].<ref name=\"Greenwood5\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=5.}}</ref>  In addition, one of Kempe's earliest known windows\u2014designed for All Souls Church in Brighton and depicting [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Martha]] and the [[Four Evangelists]]\u2014was retrieved from that church when it was demolished in the 1960s,<ref name=\"PoW6\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=6.}}</ref> and was installed in the sacristy.<ref name=\"Greenwood5\"/>\n\n==Vestry and vicarage==\nThe former vestry was added to the church in a matching style in 1908\u20139 by T.R.
