On the death of one of the Kota rajas (1771), the state was left to the charge of Jhala Zalim Singh, a descendant of Madhu Singh.\n\nFrom that time Zalim Singh was the de facto ruler of Kota. Under his administration, which lasted over forty-five years, the Kota territory was respected by all parties. In 1838 AD, British intervention and internal politics resulted with the decision to dismember the Kota state, and to create the new principality of Jhalawar as a separate provision for the descendants of Jhala Zalim Singh. The districts then severed from Kota were considered to represent one-third (120,000) of the income of Kotah; by treaty they acknowledged the supremacy of the [[British India|British]], and agreed to pay an annual tribute of Rs.8000/-. Madan Singh received the title of Maharaja Rana, and was placed on the same footing as the other chiefs in [[Rajputana]].\n\n==Geography==\nJhalawar is located at {{Coord|24.6|N|76.15|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/24/Jhalawar.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Jhalawar, India|website=www.fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 312&nbsp;metres (1023&nbsp;feet).\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of the area is identical to the Indo-Gangetic plain.
