It was released first in arcades, followed by home ports for the [[Sega Saturn]] in Japan, and later for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in all regions.\n\nCapitalizing on the success of [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' fighting game series at the time, ''Dead or Alive'' takes influence from ''Virtua Fighter'' while adding unique gameplay elements of its own. The game was well-praised for its fighting system and advanced graphics. The game also attracted attention for its presentation, which was more provocative than other mainstream 3D fighting games at the time.\n\n''Dead or Alive'' was a commercial success, helping Tecmo overcome their financial problems. The success of the game helped turn the series into a franchise, including several sequels and numerous spinoffs.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nUnlike other fighting games of the time, in place of a \"guard\" button ''Dead or Alive'' uses a \"hold\" button, which causes the fighter to grab their opponent's limbs if they are attacking at the time.<ref name=\"SatMag9\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Dead or Alive |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=July 1996|page=96}}</ref> This countering system was the first in the fighting genre to utilize different commands that correspond to each type of attack. There are two kinds of holds, an Offensive Hold and a Defensive Hold; the latter are executed by holding back or forward on the directional pad along with the guard input to either force away or counter-damage an opponent.\n\nThe outer edges of the fighting arena are set with explosives which deal a high amount of damage to any fighter who comes in contact with them.<ref name=\"SatMag9\"/> They can also send an affected character in the air so the opposing player can execute a juggling air [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]. However, this can be avoided with a defensive roll.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{See also|List of Dead or Alive characters}}\n\n*[[Bayman]], a Russian mercenary and [[Sambo (martial art)|Russian martial arts]] practitioner hired to kill DOATEC's founder and CEO, Fame Douglas.\n*[[Gen Fu]], an old Chinese [[Xing Yi Quan|xinyi liuhe quan]] martial arts master and bookstore owner who enters the tournament to win the prize money to provide funds for his sick granddaughter. \n*[[Jann Lee]], a Chinese [[Jeet Kune Do|jeet kune do]] martial artist who enters the tournament to test his skills against powerful opponents. His character is modeled on [[Bruce Lee]].\n*[[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]], a Japanese kunoichi who abandons her village in search of Raidou, the man who crippled her brother.\n*[[Leifang]], a young Chinese [[Tai chi|tai chi quan]] practitioner, who enters the tournament to defeat Jann Lee.\n*[[Raidou (Dead or Alive)|Raidou]], an evil ninja exiled from Kasumi's clan.\n*[[Ryu Hayabusa]], a Japanese ninja hero and best friend of Kasumi's brother who enters the tournament to fulfill his thirst for challenge. He is originally from ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]''.\n*[[Tina Armstrong]], an American female [[Professional wrestling|wrestler]] who enters the tournament to be noticed by Hollywood.\n*[[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]], a flamboyant African-American DJ and [[Muay Thai|kickboxer]] who enters the tournament to win the prize money.\n\nAdded in the PlayStation and ''Arcade++'' versions are Kasumi's half-sister [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] and Tina's father [[Bass Armstrong]].\n*[[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]], a Japanese kunoichi from the same clan as Kasumi who was ordered to kill her.\n*[[Bass Armstrong]], an American professional wrestling champion and father of Tina who tries to stop her from being noticed by Hollywood.\n\n== Plot ==\nA massive corporation known as DOATEC (Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee) host a fighting competition called the Dead or Alive World Combat Championship, where fighters from all over the world can compete for the title as champion and a vast amount of money. A runaway [[kunoichi]] known as Kasumi enters the Dead or Alive tournament to seek revenge against her uncle Raidou, who was responsible for crippling her brother [[Hayate (Dead or Alive)|Hayate]]. Kasumi eventually defeats and kills Raidou, but her decision to leave her village without permission violates the strict laws of the ninja society, and as a result, she becomes a hunted fugitive.\n\n== Development and release ==\nDuring the mid 1990s, Japanese gaming company [[Tecmo]] was in financial trouble. Seeing how popular [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' series was in Japan at the time, the management asked [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] to create a game similar to ''Virtua Fighter''.<ref name=\"videogamesdaily1\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |title=Video Games Daily &#124; Tomonobu Itagaki: The Kikizo Interview 2005 with Team Ninja Boss |website=Archive.videogamesdaily.com |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2016-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000936/http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |archivedate=2016-03-19 }}</ref> Itagaki was a fan of ''Virtua Fighter'', but he wanted ''Dead or Alive'' to stand out among the competition.

The game was well-praised for its fighting system and advanced graphics. The game also attracted attention for its presentation, which was more provocative than other mainstream 3D fighting games at the time.\n\n''Dead or Alive'' was a commercial success, helping Tecmo overcome their financial problems. The success of the game helped turn the series into a franchise, including several sequels and numerous spinoffs.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nUnlike other fighting games of the time, in place of a \"guard\" button ''Dead or Alive'' uses a \"hold\" button, which causes the fighter to grab their opponent's limbs if they are attacking at the time.<ref name=\"SatMag9\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Dead or Alive |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=July 1996|page=96}}</ref> This countering system was the first in the fighting genre to utilize different commands that correspond to each type of attack. There are two kinds of holds, an Offensive Hold and a Defensive Hold; the latter are executed by holding back or forward on the directional pad along with the guard input to either force away or counter-damage an opponent.\n\nThe outer edges of the fighting arena are set with explosives which deal a high amount of damage to any fighter who comes in contact with them.<ref name=\"SatMag9\"/> They can also send an affected character in the air so the opposing player can execute a juggling air [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]. However, this can be avoided with a defensive roll.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{See also|List of Dead or Alive characters}}\n\n*[[Bayman]], a Russian mercenary and [[Sambo (martial art)|Russian martial arts]] practitioner hired to kill DOATEC's founder and CEO, Fame Douglas.\n*[[Gen Fu]], an old Chinese [[Xing Yi Quan|xinyi liuhe quan]] martial arts master and bookstore owner who enters the tournament to win the prize money to provide funds for his sick granddaughter. \n*[[Jann Lee]], a Chinese [[Jeet Kune Do|jeet kune do]] martial artist who enters the tournament to test his skills against powerful opponents.

A runaway [[kunoichi]] known as Kasumi enters the Dead or Alive tournament to seek revenge against her uncle Raidou, who was responsible for crippling her brother [[Hayate (Dead or Alive)|Hayate]]. Kasumi eventually defeats and kills Raidou, but her decision to leave her village without permission violates the strict laws of the ninja society, and as a result, she becomes a hunted fugitive.\n\n== Development and release ==\nDuring the mid 1990s, Japanese gaming company [[Tecmo]] was in financial trouble. Seeing how popular [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' series was in Japan at the time, the management asked [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] to create a game similar to ''Virtua Fighter''.<ref name=\"videogamesdaily1\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |title=Video Games Daily &#124; Tomonobu Itagaki: The Kikizo Interview 2005 with Team Ninja Boss |website=Archive.videogamesdaily.com |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2016-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000936/http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |archivedate=2016-03-19 }}</ref> Itagaki was a fan of ''Virtua Fighter'', but he wanted ''Dead or Alive'' to stand out among the competition.
