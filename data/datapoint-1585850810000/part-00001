It is part of [[Loudoun County Public Schools]] and is at 340 North Maple Avenue in the town of Purcellville. Before the opening of Woodgrove High School in 2010, it was the sole high school for the western half of Loudoun County (which includes [[Purcellville]], [[Hamilton, Loudoun County, Virginia|Hamilton]], [[Round Hill, Loudoun County, Virginia|Round Hill]], [[Lovettsville, Virginia|Lovettsville]], [[Hillsboro, Loudoun County, Virginia|Hillsboro]], [[Middleburg, Virginia|Middleburg]], [[Philomont, Virginia|Philomont]] and [[Bluemont, Virginia|Bluemont]]).\n\n==History==\nLoudoun Valley opened in 1962. Throughout its history, Valley has remained a predominantly rural high school, maintained a small enrollment of roughly 800 students, and did not experience much of the sprawl that eastern Loudoun County experienced in the 1980s and 1990s. Until the 1999-2000 school year, Valley was the smallest high school in Loudoun County.\n\nRecently, due to immigration, Valley has begun to experience a high rate of growth similar to eastern Loudoun schools like [[Park View High School (Sterling, Virginia)|Park View]] and [[Broad Run High School|Broad Run]]. In 2002, [[Harmony Intermediate School]] opened as a school for 8th and 9th graders, making Valley a 10th-12th grade school. By the 2005-2006 school year, Valley had become the largest Loudoun County high school with 1,955 students. Valley had extreme overcrowding until a new western Loudoun County high school, [[Woodgrove High School]], opened in September 2010. \n\nAt this time, Loudoun Valley returned to having 9th-12th grades, and [[Harmony Intermediate School]] became Harmony Middle School, with 6th-8th grades. Loudoun Valley graduated its largest class in its \u2014 as well as in the county's \u2014 history in 2011,  graduating 558 students.\n\nThe current principal is Susan Ross. Ross was at the center of controversy in regards to grade tampering and grade inflation during the 2013 - 2014 academic school year after an article was posted in the [[Leesburg Today]], and subsequently picked up by the [[Loudoun Times-Mirror|Loudoun Times Mirror]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/hatrick-too-early-to-say-what-is-fact-and-what/article_497e59c4-da71-59dc-9835-0f872dfbcf7c.html|title=Hatrick: 'Too early to say what is fact and what is fiction'|last=Sharbel|first=Andrew|work=LoudounTimes.com|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}</ref> and [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/loudoun-valley-high-school-administration-under-investigation/2013/10/30/15981f90-4190-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|title=Loudoun Valley High School administration under investigation|last=Gibson|first=Caitlin|date=2013-10-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>, claiming that teachers felt bullied and harassed into inflating grades.\n\nAs of May 2019, the reputation of Ross has seen further decline, with local parents protesting outside of the school and creating an online petition calling for her removal as the principal of Loudoun Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/parents-protest-outside-loudoun-valley-high-school-call-for-principal/article_ba2ea6de-826a-11e9-bd04-fb1f72f81a59.html|title=Parents protest outside Loudoun Valley High School, call for principal's removal|last=kgraham@loudountimes.com|first=Karen Graham|website=LoudounTimes.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Accreditation and test scores==\n\n===Accreditation===\n[[Image:Valley grad 2010.jpg|Graduation|thumb]]\nLoudoun Valley High School is a fully accredited high school under the [[Virginia Department of Education]]'s [[Standards of Learning]] tests.\n\n===SAT scores===\nLoudoun Valley regularly scores above the national average and the statewide average.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Mathematics''' || '''Critical Reading''' || '''Writing''' || '''Total'''\n|-\n| 2000\u20132001 || 533 || 544 || n/a || 1,077\n|-\n| 2001\u20132002 || 529 || 540 || n/a || 1,069\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 537 || 551 || n/a || 1,088\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 549 || 557 || n/a || 1,106\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 553 || 559 || n/a || 1,112\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 535 || 544 || 529 || 1,608 (1,079 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 546 || 553 || 538 || 1,637 (1,099 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 552 || 551 || 539 || 1,642 (1,103 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 542 || 554 || 543 || 1,638 (1,096 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2012\u20132013 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2013\u20132014 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2014\u20132015 || 539 || 546 || 537 || 1,622 (1,085 M & CR)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001233104/http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Enrollment history==\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Number of Students''' \n|-\n| 1995\u20131996 || 1,012\n|- \n| 1996\u20131997 || 1,076\n|- \n| 1997\u20131998 || 1,147\n|- \n| 1998\u20131999 || 1,214\n|- \n| 1999\u20132000 || 1,320\n|- \n| 2000\u20132001 || 1,402\n|- \n| 2001\u20132002 || 1,503\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 1,588 (1,172 HS)\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 1,682 (1,225 HS)\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 1,817 (1,322 HS)\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 1,955 (1,440 HS)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 2,043 (1,513 HS)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 2,163 (1,637 HS)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 2,175\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || 1,331\n|}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LVathleticlogo.jpg|left|100px|Loudoun Valley's athletic logo. |thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 15 July 2007}}]] -->\nThe [[mascot]] is a [[Viking]], and the sports teams play in the [[Dulles District]] during regular season play, and [[4A Conference 21B]] and 4A West Region post-season.\n\n===District and region affiliations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The percussion and color guard also compete in AIA Indoor Percussion during the winter and spring months.\n\nThe Loudoun Valley High School  cross country team was ranked #1 in the country coming into the 2017 cross country season. They were undefeated all season and won their state meet with a perfect 15 points. They went on eventually to win the Nike Cross Nationals XC Meet with an all time low of 89 points.

Fellow Loudoun County school Stone Bridge also joined Group AAA in 2005, however, and rivalries have intensified between the two schools in many sports \u2014 such as football, volleyball, and softball \u2014 where both schools have strong programs.\n\nWith the opening of Woodgrove High School as the second Western Loudoun school in the 2010-2011 year, Valley and Woodgrove will play annually for the Western Cup.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification controversy (2005-2007 playing cycle)===\nBefore the 2005-2006 to 2006-2007 redistricting cycle, Valley was determined to be in Group AAA and was expected to join the Northern Region with fellow district member Stone Bridge. They met very strong resistance with member schools. After several heated debates, Stone Bridge joined the [[AAA Liberty District|Liberty District]] and Valley to the National District as a tournament-only member. The move was highly controversial among the National District's membership, because they were on an average of 50 miles or more from Valley. This was remedied with Valley's reassignment to the Cedar Run District and Northwest Region in 2007, which was welcomed by most Northern Region members.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification (2013-2015 playing cycle)===\nBefore 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] assigned teams to local districts, regions, and one of three state groups: A for small schools, AA for medium schools, and AAA for large schools. The districts were used for regular season play and the first round of post-season playoffs. In 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] reclassified the system so that there were six state groups, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A, with the smallest being 1A and the largest being 6A.\n\nThey switched from geographically located districts to school size based conferences for post-season playoffs, keeping the districts for regular season play. As part of this transition, Loudoun Valley was moved from state group AAA to 3A, remained in the [[Dulles District]], and joined Conference 28. Loudoun Valley was later bumped up to state group 4A and joined Conference 21B in 2015.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Mark Herring]], 48th Attorney General of Virginia<ref>{{cite news |url=https://loudounnow.com/2018/02/01/the-real-deal-as-herrings-profile-rises-loudouns-homegrown-ag-stays-in-touch-with-his-roots/ |title=As Herring's Profile Rises, Loudoun's Homegrown AG Stays in Touch with His Roots |first=Jan |last=Mercker |date=February 1, 2018 |newspaper=Loudoun Now}}</ref>\n*[[Drew Hunter]] (Class of 2016), signed a 10 year contract with Adidas to run professional track, high school record holder for the indoor mile, 1500m run and 3000m run, Footlocker National Cross Country Champion - 2015  <ref>{{cite web |title=Loudoun Valley's Drew Hunter named Gatorade National Cross-Country Runner of the Year |website=AllMetSports |publisher=Washington Post |first=Jacob |last=Emert |date=February 24, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2016/02/24/loudoun-valleys-drew-hunter-named-gatorade-national-cross-country-runner-of-the-year/}}</ref>\n*[[Rob Jones (Marine)|Rob Jones]] (Class of 2003), United States Marine and athlete<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/10/19/31-marathons-31-days-31-cities-after-losing-both-legs-in-afghanistan-hes-running-to-inspire/ |title=31 marathons, 31 days, 31 cities: After losing both legs in Afghanistan, he\u2019s running to inspire |website=D.C.

Ross was at the center of controversy in regards to grade tampering and grade inflation during the 2013 - 2014 academic school year after an article was posted in the [[Leesburg Today]], and subsequently picked up by the [[Loudoun Times-Mirror|Loudoun Times Mirror]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/hatrick-too-early-to-say-what-is-fact-and-what/article_497e59c4-da71-59dc-9835-0f872dfbcf7c.html|title=Hatrick: 'Too early to say what is fact and what is fiction'|last=Sharbel|first=Andrew|work=LoudounTimes.com|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}</ref> and [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/loudoun-valley-high-school-administration-under-investigation/2013/10/30/15981f90-4190-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|title=Loudoun Valley High School administration under investigation|last=Gibson|first=Caitlin|date=2013-10-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>, claiming that teachers felt bullied and harassed into inflating grades.\n\nAs of May 2019, the reputation of Ross has seen further decline, with local parents protesting outside of the school and creating an online petition calling for her removal as the principal of Loudoun Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/parents-protest-outside-loudoun-valley-high-school-call-for-principal/article_ba2ea6de-826a-11e9-bd04-fb1f72f81a59.html|title=Parents protest outside Loudoun Valley High School, call for principal's removal|last=kgraham@loudountimes.com|first=Karen Graham|website=LoudounTimes.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Accreditation and test scores==\n\n===Accreditation===\n[[Image:Valley grad 2010.jpg|Graduation|thumb]]\nLoudoun Valley High School is a fully accredited high school under the [[Virginia Department of Education]]'s [[Standards of Learning]] tests.\n\n===SAT scores===\nLoudoun Valley regularly scores above the national average and the statewide average.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Mathematics''' || '''Critical Reading''' || '''Writing''' || '''Total'''\n|-\n| 2000\u20132001 || 533 || 544 || n/a || 1,077\n|-\n| 2001\u20132002 || 529 || 540 || n/a || 1,069\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 537 || 551 || n/a || 1,088\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 549 || 557 || n/a || 1,106\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 553 || 559 || n/a || 1,112\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 535 || 544 || 529 || 1,608 (1,079 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 546 || 553 || 538 || 1,637 (1,099 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 552 || 551 || 539 || 1,642 (1,103 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 542 || 554 || 543 || 1,638 (1,096 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2012\u20132013 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2013\u20132014 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2014\u20132015 || 539 || 546 || 537 || 1,622 (1,085 M & CR)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001233104/http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Enrollment history==\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Number of Students''' \n|-\n| 1995\u20131996 || 1,012\n|- \n| 1996\u20131997 || 1,076\n|- \n| 1997\u20131998 || 1,147\n|- \n| 1998\u20131999 || 1,214\n|- \n| 1999\u20132000 || 1,320\n|- \n| 2000\u20132001 || 1,402\n|- \n| 2001\u20132002 || 1,503\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 1,588 (1,172 HS)\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 1,682 (1,225 HS)\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 1,817 (1,322 HS)\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 1,955 (1,440 HS)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 2,043 (1,513 HS)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 2,163 (1,637 HS)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 2,175\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || 1,331\n|}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LVathleticlogo.jpg|left|100px|Loudoun Valley's athletic logo. |thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 15 July 2007}}]] -->\nThe [[mascot]] is a [[Viking]], and the sports teams play in the [[Dulles District]] during regular season play, and [[4A Conference 21B]] and 4A West Region post-season.\n\n===District and region affiliations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the 2018 season they remained undefeated throughout the whole season, once again; winning the Nike Cross Nationals XC Meet with a new all time low of 77 points. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Mull |first1=Cory |title=Recapping The Record Setting Day For Boys At NXN |url=https://www.milesplit.com/articles/252764-recapping-the-record-setting-day-for-boys-at-nxn |website=Milesplit USA |publisher=FloSports |accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====State championships====\n{{ref improve section|date=December 2017}}\nLoudoun Valley has won twelve AA state championships:\n*Three in Girls' Volleyball (2000\u20132001; 2001\u20132002; 2004\u20132005)\n*Two in Softball (2003; 2005)\n*One in Girls' Track (1976)\n*One in Baseball (1972)\n*One in Golf (1994)\n*One in Men's Track 4x800 relay (2003)\n*One in Men's Lacrosse (2004)\n*One in Men's Swimming (2004)\n*One in Men's Track 4x400 relay (2005)\n\nLoudoun Valley has won one AAA state championship in Girls' Volleyball (2009\u20132010).\n\nLoudoun Valley has won two 3A state championships:\n*One in Baseball (2014)\n*One in Men's Track (2015)\n\nLoudoun Valley has won thirteen 4A state championships:\n*One in Men's Lacrosse (2015)\n*Five in Men's Cross Country (2015-2019)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://va.milesplit.com/meets/214057/results/414136/formatted#.VzO0SIQrI5s|title=VHSL State Cross Country Championships - 4A Boys|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref>\n*Two in Women's Cross Country (2018 & 2019)\n*One in Men\u2019s Basketball (2018)\n*Three in Men's Indoor Track (2018-2020)\n*One in Women's Indoor Track (2020)\n\nLoudoun Valley has won five AA sportsmanship awards:\n*Three in Girls' Volleyball (1999\u20132000; 2002\u20132003; 2004\u20132005)\n*Two in Girls' Basketball (1993\u20131994; 1994\u20131995)\n\n===Rivalries===\nValley's traditional rival school is [[Loudoun County High School]] in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]], but this rivalry died down since the opening of [[Heritage High School (Leesburg, Virginia)|Heritage High School]] in Leesburg in 2002.\n\nAfter Loudoun Valley's move to Group AAA in 2005, both Valley and County in 2006 agreed not to play games against each other for an indefinite time, making the rivalry nearly obsolete. Fellow Loudoun County school Stone Bridge also joined Group AAA in 2005, however, and rivalries have intensified between the two schools in many sports \u2014 such as football, volleyball, and softball \u2014 where both schools have strong programs.\n\nWith the opening of Woodgrove High School as the second Western Loudoun school in the 2010-2011 year, Valley and Woodgrove will play annually for the Western Cup.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification controversy (2005-2007 playing cycle)===\nBefore the 2005-2006 to 2006-2007 redistricting cycle, Valley was determined to be in Group AAA and was expected to join the Northern Region with fellow district member Stone Bridge. They met very strong resistance with member schools. After several heated debates, Stone Bridge joined the [[AAA Liberty District|Liberty District]] and Valley to the National District as a tournament-only member. The move was highly controversial among the National District's membership, because they were on an average of 50 miles or more from Valley. This was remedied with Valley's reassignment to the Cedar Run District and Northwest Region in 2007, which was welcomed by most Northern Region members.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification (2013-2015 playing cycle)===\nBefore 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] assigned teams to local districts, regions, and one of three state groups: A for small schools, AA for medium schools, and AAA for large schools. The districts were used for regular season play and the first round of post-season playoffs. In 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] reclassified the system so that there were six state groups, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A, with the smallest being 1A and the largest being 6A.\n\nThey switched from geographically located districts to school size based conferences for post-season playoffs, keeping the districts for regular season play. As part of this transition, Loudoun Valley was moved from state group AAA to 3A, remained in the [[Dulles District]], and joined Conference 28. Loudoun Valley was later bumped up to state group 4A and joined Conference 21B in 2015.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Blair Brown Lipsit]], volleyball player for Penn State who won four consecutive NCAA National Championships  [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2007]], [[2008 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2008]], [[2009 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2009]], and [[2010 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2010]].\n*[[Mark Herring]], 48th Attorney General of Virginia<ref>{{cite news |url=https://loudounnow.com/2018/02/01/the-real-deal-as-herrings-profile-rises-loudouns-homegrown-ag-stays-in-touch-with-his-roots/ |title=As Herring's Profile Rises, Loudoun's Homegrown AG Stays in Touch with His Roots |first=Jan |last=Mercker |date=February 1, 2018 |newspaper=Loudoun Now}}</ref>\n*[[Drew Hunter]] (Class of 2016), signed a 10 year contract with Adidas to run professional track, high school record holder for the indoor mile, 1500m run and 3000m run, Footlocker National Cross Country Champion - 2015  <ref>{{cite web |title=Loudoun Valley's Drew Hunter named Gatorade National Cross-Country Runner of the Year |website=AllMetSports |publisher=Washington Post |first=Jacob |last=Emert |date=February 24, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2016/02/24/loudoun-valleys-drew-hunter-named-gatorade-national-cross-country-runner-of-the-year/}}</ref>\n*[[Rob Jones (Marine)|Rob Jones]] (Class of 2003), United States Marine and athlete<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/10/19/31-marathons-31-days-31-cities-after-losing-both-legs-in-afghanistan-hes-running-to-inspire/ |title=31 marathons, 31 days, 31 cities: After losing both legs in Afghanistan, he\u2019s running to inspire |website=D.C.
