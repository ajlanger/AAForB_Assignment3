Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using coal to produce a wide range of valuable{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} commodities.\n\nBecause the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} and China{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} where there are abundant coal resources.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.
