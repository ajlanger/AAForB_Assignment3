He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other. V. Shantaram had a very keen interest in music. It is said that he \"ghost wrote\" music for many of his music directors, and took a very active part in the creation of music. Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before they were approved by V. Shantaram.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Narwekar|first=Kiran Shantaram with Sanjit|title=V.

Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named [[Prabhat Film Company|his movie company]]) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of [[Pandit Jasraj]] and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality [[Durga Jasraj]].<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jai-ho-jasraj/article2254030.ece Jai ho!

Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children \u2013 one son, the Marathi film director and producer [[Kiran Shantaram]],<ref name=\"Gavankar2011\">{{cite book|author=Gavankar, Nilu N. |title=The Desai Trio and the Movie Industry of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGAyEpXtK3UC&pg=PA139|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=26 July 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-9981-7|page=139}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 50 years of a Shantaram classic | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-years-of-a-Shantaram-classic/articleshow/2033356.cms |author=Mishra, Ambarish |date=28 September 2006| accessdate = 22 September 2014 | publisher = The Times of India}}</ref> and two daughters, [[Rajshree]] (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's seven children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress [[Sandhya Shantaram|Sandhya]] (n\u00e9e Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'', ''Navrang'', ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' and ''Sehra''. Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also.\n\nFinally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways.\n\nHardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of ''pativratha sanskar,'' and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi \u201cHey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)\" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Navrang]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]]'' and ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]].''\n\nShantaram died on 30 October 1990 in [[Mumbai]].<ref name=bfi>[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/14188 Biography] American Film Institute.</ref> He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai died in 1996 after being bedridden for four years. Sandhya lives today in the care and company of Vimalabai's children, especially of Prabhat and his family.\n\nShantaram used to live at [[Panhala]] near [[Kolhapur]] in [[Maharashtra]] state. His daughter Saroj has maintained his house and has converted it into a hotel named Valley View.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n\n===As actor===\n*\"[[Surekha Haran]]\" (1921)\n* [[Sinhagad (film)|''Sinhagad'']] (1923)\n* ''[[Savkari Pash]]'' (1925)\n* [[Stree (1961 film)|''Stri'']] (1961)\n* ''[[Parchhain]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Do Ankhen Barah Haath]]'' (1957)\n\n===As producer===\n* ''Banwasi'' (1948)\n* ''Sehra'' (1963)\n* ''[[Geet Gaya Patharon Ne]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Ladki Sahyadri Ki]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' (1971)\n* ''Raja Rani Ko Chahiye Pasina'' (1978)\n* ''[[Jhanjhaar]]'' (1987)\n\n===As director===\n\n====[[Maharashtra Film Company]]====\n* [[Netaji Palkar (film)|''Netaji Palkar'']] (1927)\n\n====[[Prabhat Film Company]]====\n* [[Gopal Krishna (1929 film)|''Gopal Krishna'']] (1929)\n* ''[[Udaykal]]'' (1930)\n* [[Rani Saheba (1930 film)|''Rani Saheba'']] (1930)\n* ''[[Khooni Khanjar]]'' (1930)\n* [[Chandrasena (1931 film)|''Chandrasena'']] (1931)\n* [[Maya Machindra#1932 Hindi/Marathi film|''Maya Machindra'']] (1932)\n* [[Jalti Nishani|''Agnikankan'']] (1932)\n* ''[[Ayodhyecha Raja]]'' (1932)\n* [[Sinhagad (film)|''Sinhagad'']] (1933)\n* [[Sairandhri (film)|''Sairandhri'']] (1933)\n* [[Amrit Manthan (1934 film)|''Amrit Manthan'']] (1934)\n* [[Dharmatma (1935 film)|''Dharmatma'']] (1935)\n* [[Chandrasena (1935 film)|''Chandrasena'']] (1935)\n* ''[[Amar Jyoti]]'' (1936)\n* ''[[Duniya Na Mane]]'' (1937)\n* ''[[Kunku]]'' (1937)\n* ''[[Manoos]]'' (1939)\n* [[Aadmi (1939 film)|''Aadmi'']] (1939)<ref name=\"aadmi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gomolo.com/aadmi-movie/749|accessdate=27 June 2014|title=Aadmi (1939) \u2013 Movie Review, Story, Trailers, Videos, Photos, Wallpapers, Songs, Trivia, Movie Tickets}}</ref>\n* [[Padosi (film)|''Padosi'']] (1941)\n\n====[[Rajkamal Kalamandir]]====\n* [[Shakuntala (1943 film)|''Shakuntala'']] (1943)\n* ''[[Bhagawan Das Patel]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani]]'' (1946)\n* ''[[Lokshahir Ram Joshi]]'' (1947)\n* [[Apna Desh (1949 film)|''Apna Desh'']] (1949)\n* [[Dahej (film)|''Dahej'']] (1950)\n* ''[[Amar Bhoopali]]'' (1951)\n* ''[[Teen Batti Char Raasta]]'' (1953)\n* ''[[Surang]]'' (1953)\n* ''[[Subah Ka Tara]]'' (1954)\n* ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'' (1955)\n* [[Toofan Aur Deeya|''Toofan Aur Diya'']] (1956)\n* ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[Navrang]]'' (1959)\n* [[Stree (1961 film)|''Stree'']] (1961)\n* [[Sehra (film)|''Sehra'']] (1963)\n* ''[[Geet Gaya Patharon Ne]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Ladki Sahyadri Ki]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Boond Jo Ban Gayee Moti]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' (1971)\n* [[Pinjra (film)|''Pinjra'']] (1973)\n* ''[[Jhanjhaar]]'' (1987)\n\n{{refend}}\nSource: IMDB<ref>{{cite web|title=IMDB Proile films|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788391/filmoyear|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=16 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904020029/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788391/filmoyear|archivedate=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n\n===Recognition===\n\n* 2017 \u2013 on 18 November 2017, [[Google]] honored Shantaram on his 116th Birthday with a [[Google Doodle]] on their Indian front page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/v-shantarams-116th-birthday|title=V.

He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other. V. Shantaram had a very keen interest in music. It is said that he \"ghost wrote\" music for many of his music directors, and took a very active part in the creation of music. Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before they were approved by V. Shantaram.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Narwekar|first=Kiran Shantaram with Sanjit|title=V.

Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named [[Prabhat Film Company|his movie company]]) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of [[Pandit Jasraj]] and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality [[Durga Jasraj]].<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jai-ho-jasraj/article2254030.ece Jai ho!

Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children \u2013 one son, the Marathi film director and producer [[Kiran Shantaram]],<ref name=\"Gavankar2011\">{{cite book|author=Gavankar, Nilu N. |title=The Desai Trio and the Movie Industry of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGAyEpXtK3UC&pg=PA139|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=26 July 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-9981-7|page=139}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 50 years of a Shantaram classic | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-years-of-a-Shantaram-classic/articleshow/2033356.cms |author=Mishra, Ambarish |date=28 September 2006| accessdate = 22 September 2014 | publisher = The Times of India}}</ref> and two daughters, [[Rajshree]] (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's seven children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress [[Sandhya Shantaram|Sandhya]] (n\u00e9e Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'', ''Navrang'', ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' and ''Sehra''. Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also.\n\nFinally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways.\n\nHardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of ''pativratha sanskar,'' and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi \u201cHey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)\" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Navrang]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]]'' and ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]].''\n\nShantaram died on 30 October 1990 in [[Mumbai]].<ref name=bfi>[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/14188 Biography] American Film Institute.</ref> He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai died in 1996 after being bedridden for four years.
