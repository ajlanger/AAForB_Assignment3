Sweeney left the band in late 1981 and Reed permanently took over as vocalist, with Martin Fagan joining as a second guitarist.  The group's sound, featuring a numbing guitar drone, powerfully throbbing [[bass guitar|bass]], pounding [[drum machine]], and Reed's cavernous vocal tones, caused the Lorries (as their fans came to call them) to be quickly lumped into the then-developing [[gothic rock]] scene by pop journalists, although the band themselves denied they were ever associated with goth and preferred to cite [[Wire (band)|Wire]] as an influence,<ref name=\"Gittins\">Gittins, Ian. ''[[Melody Maker]]'', \"The Angry Brigade\" article on the band, 25 October 1986, pg. 32.</ref> and said they \"were primarily inspired by [[MC5]].\"<ref name=\"Wolfenden\">Wolfenden, David.

Fagan and Smith soon departed the band, to be replaced by Dave Wolfenden and Paul Southern respectively.  Afterwards, bassist Southern was replaced by Leon Phillips. While numerous additional personnel changes would occur in the history of the band, Wolfenden became a mainstay and a frequent songwriting partner of Reed's during the band's most productive period.  In 1983 and 1984, the band released several more singles (including \"He's Read\" and \"Monkeys On Juice\", which reached No.&nbsp;9 on the NME indie chart<ref name=\"Chart1\">\"Independent 45s\" Chart, ''New Musical Express'', 4 August 1984, pg. 4</ref>).

Two albums followed, 1988's ''[[Nothing Wrong]]'' and 1989's ''[[Blow (Red Lorry Yellow Lorry album)|Blow]]''.  Neither of the Beggars Banquet albums appeared on any mainstream pop charts.

In 1991, the band released a further single, \"Talking Back\", and then the ''[[Blasting Off]]'' album on the tiny Sparkhead label, after which Reed broke up what was left of the band.\n\nIn 2003, Reed revived the name Red Lorry Yellow Lorry and released four new songs in 2004, available via internet download only on the band\u2019s website.
