At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. [[Intel Corporation]] would supply any new processors to more established companies like [[IBM]] first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering [[prototype]]s. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an [[Intel 80486|Intel 486]], but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard.

At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. [[Intel Corporation]] would supply any new processors to more established companies like [[IBM]] first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering [[prototype]]s. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an [[Intel 80486|Intel 486]], but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5cSIAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA143&pg=PA143|title = Invisible Gold in Asia: Creating Wealth Through Intellectual Property, page 143, by David Llewelyn |publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd |date = 28 February 2011 |accessdate = 22 December 2013|isbn = 9789814312714 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastbusiness.com/top/asus.htm |title = ASUS Company Information < By Mast Business |website=publishesiness.com|date=3 January 2008|accessdate = 8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2005, Asus released the first [[PhysX]] accelerator card.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.vr-zone.com/?i=2724&s=1  |title = ASUS PhysX Card Ready |publisher = Vr-zone.com |accessdate = 1 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.newlaunches.com/archives/ASUS_enters_lcd_tv_market_with_tlw32001_32_lcd_tv.php  |title = ASUS enters LCD TV market with TLW32001 32\" LCD TV |publisher = Newlaunches.com |accessdate = 1 June 2010}}</ref> In January 2006, Asus announced that it would cooperate with [[Lamborghini]] to develop the VX laptop series.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2002091,00.asp |title = ASUS VX1 Lamborghini |accessdate = 1 April 2013 |publisher = PC Mag |date = 11 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one of the manufacturers of the first [[Ultra-Mobile PC|Microsoft Origami]] models, together with [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[Founder Technology]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url        = http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/business/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=181502222\n|title      = Microsoft Unfolds Origami, The 'On The Go' PC\n|first      = Walko\n|last       = John\n|date       = 9 March 2006\n|work       = [[InformationWeek]]\n|accessdate = 16 November 2009\n|quote      = Microsoft (NSDQ: MSFT) says three companies have built working models \u2013 Samsung, ASUS, and Founder, China's second largest PC maker.
