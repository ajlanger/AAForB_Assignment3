(2004), the Brahui population has a high prevalence (55%) of western Eurasian mtDNAs and the lowest frequency in the region (21%) of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]]*, which is common (\u223c60%) among the Dravidian-speaking Indians. So the possibility of the Dravidian presence in Baluchistan originating from recent entry of Dravidians of India should be excluded. It also shows their maternal gene pool is similar to Indo-Iranian speakers. The present Brahui population may have originated from ancient Indian Dravidian-speakers who may have relocated to Baluchistan and admixed with locals; however, no historical record supports this. So it is suggested that they are the last northern survivors of a larger Dravidian-speaking region before Indo-Iranian arrived. This would, if true, reinforce the [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|proto-Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Llu\u00eds|last2=Chaix|first2=Rapha\u00eblle|last3=Wells|first3=R.

(2004), the Brahui population has a high prevalence (55%) of western Eurasian mtDNAs and the lowest frequency in the region (21%) of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]]*, which is common (\u223c60%) among the Dravidian-speaking Indians. So the possibility of the Dravidian presence in Baluchistan originating from recent entry of Dravidians of India should be excluded. It also shows their maternal gene pool is similar to Indo-Iranian speakers. The present Brahui population may have originated from ancient Indian Dravidian-speakers who may have relocated to Baluchistan and admixed with locals; however, no historical record supports this. So it is suggested that they are the last northern survivors of a larger Dravidian-speaking region before Indo-Iranian arrived. This would, if true, reinforce the [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|proto-Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Llu\u00eds|last2=Chaix|first2=Rapha\u00eblle|last3=Wells|first3=R.
