The sport requires sufficient area on a smooth stretch of water, one or two skis, a tow boat with tow rope, three people (depending on state boating laws), and a [[personal flotation device]]. In addition, the skier must have adequate upper and lower body strength, muscular endurance, and good balance.\n\nThere are water ski participants around the world, in [[Asia]] and Australia, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and [[Americas|the Americas]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.iwsf.com/ | title = Regional Sites | publisher = International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081004210007/http://www.iwsf.com/ | archivedate = 4 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In the United States alone, there are approximately 11 million water skiers and over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions every year.<ref name=ws-profile>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/USA-WS%20Profile.htm | title = USA Water Ski Profile | publisher = USA Water Ski | accessdate = 1 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927194235/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/USA-WS%20Profile.htm | archivedate = 27 September 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Australia boasts 1.3 million water skiers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.awwf.com.au/customdata/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_image_listing&CategoryID=9664&itemLayout=1&headerselector=3&OrgID=5182 | title = About Us | publisher = Australian Waterski & Wakeboard Federation | accessdate = 29 October 2013 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140124004427/http://awwf.com.au/customdata/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_image_listing&CategoryID=9664&itemLayout=1&headerselector=3&OrgID=5182 | archivedate = 24 January 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are many options for [[recreation]]al or [[competitive]] water skiers.

Water skiing typically begins with a deep-water start. The skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, have the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water. Most times it can be easier to put the skis on when they are wet. Once the skier has their skis on they will be thrown a tow rope from the boat, which they position between their skis. In the deep-water start, the skier crouches down in the water while holding onto the ski rope; they are in a cannonball position with their legs tucked into their chest, with skis pointing towards the sky and approximately {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} of the ski out of the water. The skier can also perform a \"dry start\" by standing on the shore or a pier; however, this type of entry is recommended for professionals only. When the skier is ready (usually acknowledged by them yelling \"hit it\"), the driver accelerates the boat. As the boat accelerates and takes up the slack on the rope, the skier allows the boat to pull them out of the water by applying some [[muscle strength]] to get them! into an upright body position.\n\nBy leaning back and keeping the legs slightly bent, the skis will eventually plane out and the skier will start to glide over the water. The skier turns by shifting weight left or right. The skier's body weight should be balanced between the balls of the feet and the heels. While being towed, the skier's arms should be relaxed but still fully extended so as to reduce stress on the arms. The handle can be held vertically or horizontally, depending on whichever position is more comfortable for the skier.\n\nIn addition to the driver and the skier, a third person known as the ''spotter'' or the ''observer'' should be present. The spotter's job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls. The spotter usually sits in a chair on the boat facing backwards to see the skier. The skier and the boat's occupants communicate using hand signals (see the [[#Safety measures|Safety]] section below).\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side.jpg|thumb|A privately owned, man-made water ski lake commonly referred to as Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side, located near Orangeville, Ontario seen with a slalom course and jump ramp]]\nWater skiing can take place on any type of water \u2013 such as a river, lake, or ocean \u2013 but calmer waters are ideal for recreational skiing.  There should be a {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} skiing space and the water should be at least {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|1|order=flip}} deep. There must be enough space for the water skier to safely \"get up\", or successfully be in the upright skiing position. Skiers and their boat drivers must also have sufficient room to avoid hazards.\n\n===Skis===\n[[File:Datteln - KF2011 - Ostufer 06 ies.jpg|thumb|Several types of water skis and [[wetsuit]]s]]\nYounger skiers generally start out on children's skis, which consist of two skis tied together at their back and front. These connections mean that less strength is necessary for the child to keep the skis together. Sometimes these skis can come with a handle to help balance the skier as well.<ref name=childrens-skis>{{cite web | title = Children's Waterskis | url = http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-best-childrens-water-skis.html | first = Houlihan | last = Macaco | date = 27 January 2011 | work = Made Manual | publisher = Break Media | accessdate = 23 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195032/http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-best-childrens-water-skis.html | archivedate = 29 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Children's skis are short \u2013 usually {{convert|45|-|60|in|cm|sigfig=2|order=flip}} long<ref name=childrens-skis/> \u2013 reflecting the skier's smaller size.

Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be. Length will also vary based on the type of water skiing being performed; jump skis, for example, are longer than skis used in regular straight-line recreational skiing or competitive slalom and trick skiing. A trick ski is around 40 inches long and wider than combo skis. Again the skier rides it with his or her dominant foot in front. It has no fins which allows for spins to be performed.\n\n===Boat===\n{{hatnote|This section describes water skiing behind a boat. For information about skiing with a cable installation, see the related Wikipedia article on [[cable skiing]].}}\n\nCompetition skiing uses specifically designed towboats. Most towboats have a very small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed in the back of the boat ([[v-drive]]), which creates a bigger wake. Permitted towboats used for tournament water skiing are the Mastercraft ProStar 197, MasterCraft ProStar 190, Nautique 200, Malibu Response TXi, and Centurion Carbon Pro.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/TournKit/AWSA/Chief%20Driver/ApprovedTournamentTowboats.pdf | format = PDF | title = American Water Ski Association Approved Tournament Towboats, 2013 | date = 15 January 2013 | publisher = American Water Ski Association | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120916234342/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/TournKit/AWSA/Chief%20Driver/ApprovedTournamentTowboats.pdf | archivedate = 16 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These boats have ability to pull skiers for trick skiing, jumping, and slalom.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2013/03/04/best-of-boats-top-tournament-ski-boats/ | title = Best of Boats: Top Tournament Ski Boats 2013 | author = Geena | date = 7 May 2013 | publisher = Waterski Magazine | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130908021150/http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2013/03/04/best-of-boats-top-tournament-ski-boats/ | archivedate = 8 September 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nRecreational boats can serve as water skiing platforms as well as other purposes such as cruising and fishing.

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h|order=flip}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States.\n\nSamuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421022737/http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope was made from a long [[Sash window|window sash]] cord.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment.\n\nThe first patent for water skis was issued to [[Fred Waller]], of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as \"Dolphin Akwa-Skees.\" Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.\n\nIn 1928 [http://www.usawaterskifoundation.org/#!don-ibsen/czd0 Don Ibsen] developed his own water skis on the West Coast, never having heard of Samuelson or Waller. In 1941 Don Ibsen founded The Olympic Water Ski Club in Seattle, WA. It was the first such club in America. Ibsen, a showman and entrepreneur, was one of the earliest manufacturers of water skis and was a leading enthusiast and promoter of the sport. In 1983 he was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in Winterhaven, FL.\n\nThe sport of water skiing remained an obscure activity for several years after 1922, until Samuelson performed water ski shows from Michigan to Florida. The American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson in 1966 as the first recorded water skier in history. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, slalom skier, and the first organizer of a water ski show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph W.

Both men are in the [[Water Ski Hall of Fame and Museum|Water Ski Hall of Fame]]. Today, Winter Haven, Florida, with its famous [[Chain of Lakes (Winter Haven)|Chain of Lakes]], remains an important city for water skiing, with several major ski schools operating there.\n\nWater skiing has developed over time. Water skiing tournaments and water skiing competitions have been organized. As an exhibition sport, water skiing was included in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. The first National Show Ski Tournament was held in 1974, and the first ever National Intercollegiate Water Ski Championships were held in 1979. The Home CARE US National Water Ski Challenge, the first competition for people with disabilities, was organized ten years later.\n\nThe first patented design of a water ski which included carbon fiber was that of Hani Audah at SPORT labs in 2001. Its first inclusion in tournament slalom skiing was in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportkc.org/sportkc.aspx?pgID=1180 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323232839/http://www.sportkc.org/sportkc.aspx?pgID=1180 |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Disciplines ==\n\n===3-event tournament water skiing===\nIn the United States, there are over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions each summer.<ref name=ws-profile/> [[Orlando, Florida]] is considered to be the competitive 3-event waterskiing capital of the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2015/08/05/how-orlando-became-the-mecca-of-water-skiing|title=How Orlando Became the Mecca of Water Skiing|work=Waterski Magazine|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904012142/http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2015/08/05/how-orlando-became-the-mecca-of-water-skiing|archivedate=4 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Competitive water skiing consists of three events: slalom, jump, and trick.<ref name=ws-profile/><ref name=iwsf-history>{{cite web | url = http://www.iwsfranking.com/WSWC/history.htm | title = World Championship History | publisher = Water Ski World Cup (WSWC) | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019114906/http://www.iwsfranking.com/WSWC/history.htm | archivedate = 19 October 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Slalom====\n[[File:Slalom Good Pic.jpg|thumb|17-year-old Toronto skier [[Chantal Singer]] slaloming at the 2012 Canadian National Waterski Championships in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]]]]\nIn an attempt to become as agile as possible, slalom water skiers use only one ski with feet oriented forward, one in front of the other. Slalom skis are narrow and long, at {{convert|57|-|70|in|cm|0}} depending on the height and weight of the skier. The two forward-facing bindings vary: they can be made of rubber or thick plastic, and they can be designed more like a [[Ski binding|snow ski binding]] or more like a [[Inline skates|roller blade boot]].\n\nSlalom skiing involves a multi-buoy course that the skier must go around in order to complete the pass. A complete slalom water ski course consists of 26 buoys. There are entrance gates at the beginning and end of the course that the skier must go between, and there are 6 turn buoys that the skier must navigate around in a zigzag pattern. The remainder of the buoys are for the driver to ensure the boat goes straight down the center of the course. For a tournament to be sanctioned as 'record capable' by the [[International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation]] (IWWF), the entire course must be surveyed prior to competition by a land surveyor to ensure its accuracy. The drivers boat path must be verified as well to ensure that all skiers are getting a fair pull.\n\nEvery consecutive<ref name=iwsf-history/> pass is harder than the pass before it. When a pass is completed, the boat is sped up by {{convert|3|km/h|mph|0}} until the maximum speed has been reached for the division, based on the skier's gender and age ({{convert|55|km/h|mph|0}} for women and {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} for men). After the skier has run their maximum speed pass, the rope is shortened at specific increments to make it more difficult to reach the buoy width. In a tournament, the boat speeds up or the rope shortens until the skier fails to complete the slalom course by falling or not getting around a buoy.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nA skier's score is based upon the number of successful buoys cleared, the speed of the boat, and the length of the rope. In a tournament, skiers choose the starting boat speed and rope length (with a maximum length of {{convert|22.86|m|ft|0}}). Professional water skiers will typically start at the max speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} with a rope that has already been shortened to {{convert|13|m|ft}}. The skier with the most buoys wins the competition.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nThe turn buoys are positioned {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} away from the center of the slalom course. As the rope is shortened beyond that, the skiers are required to use the momentum generated through their turns to swing up on the side of the boat and reach out in order to get their ski around the next buoy. At these rope lengths, the skier's body is experiencing intense isometric contractions and extreme upper body torque with loads of up to 600&nbsp;kg as they begin accelerating after rounding a turn buoy. Their top speeds will generally be more than double the boat's speed, which means that the Pro men can reach speeds in excess of {{convert|116|km/h|mph}} and each turn will generally generate around 4 [[g-force|g of force]]. Essentially, slalom water skiers are using their body as a lever, which allows them to withstand loads that would otherwise not be possible for the human body.\n\n====Jump====\n\nWater ski jumpers use two long skis to ride over a water ski jump in an attempt to travel the longest distance. In a tournament, skiers are given three attempts to hit the ramp. The winner is the skier who travels the farthest calculated<ref name=manual-2003/> distance and successfully rides away.<ref name=ripnride>{{cite web|title=Jump Gold|work=Rip 'n Ride|publisher=Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada|url=http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|accessdate=1 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222034/http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are no style points, simply distance.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nWater ski jumps have specific dimensions and the ramp height is adjustable. Skiers may choose their boat speed and ramp height, although there are maximums based the skier's gender and age. Professional ski jumpers have a maximum boat speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}}. The ramp height must be between {{convert|5|and|6|ft|m|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. As a professional jumper approaches the ramp they will zigzag behind the boat in a series of cuts<ref name=ripnride/> to generate speed and angle. When the jumper hits the ramp they will generally be going over {{convert|112|km/h|mph|0}} and the load they have generated on the rope can be over {{convert|600|kg|lb}}.\n\n====Trick====\n[[File:Fischlham Mevisto Cup 2017 Trickski Theresa Schmidberger1-1.jpg|thumb|A competitor at a trick skiing event in Austria in 2017]]\nThe Trick competition has been described as the most technical of the three classic water skiing events.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nTrick skiing uses small, oval-shaped or oblong water skis. Beginners generally use two skis while more advanced skiers use one.<ref name=iwsf-history/> The shorter, wider Trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45\u00b0. It has a smooth bottom that allows it to turn over the surface of the water. According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event competition in the United States and the Pan-Am Games, skis used in the Tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} are allowed, as are a foot pad cemented to the ski as a place for the rear foot; in addition, the ski must float with all bindings, fins, etc., installed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The ski's configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.\n\nIn a tournament, skiers are given two 20-second runs during which they perform a series of their chosen tricks. In most cases, one pass is for hand tricks, which includes surface turns, rotations over the wake, and flips. The second pass is for toe tricks, which are done by doing wake turns and rotations with only a foot attaching them to the handle; the foot is either in the toehold part of the handle or, professionally, attached to the rope. <ref name=iwsf-history/>The toehold part of the handle does not allow the skier to let go of the handle if they lose their balance and fall into the water, therefore a person in the boat is required to release the rope from the boat using a quick release mechanism installed on the ski pylon. A trick cannot be repeated.<ref name=iwsf-history/> Each trick has a point value. A panel of five judges assesses which tricks were completed correctly and assigns that predetermined point value to each successfully completed trick. The skier with the most points wins.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\n===Barefoot water skiing===\n[[File:Barefoot Waterskier Michael French.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barefoot skiing]] on [[Lake Ozonia]] in the Adirondacks]]\n{{main|Barefoot skiing}}\nA barefoot water skier should use a [[wetsuit]] instead of a [[life jacket]] because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed. The [[wetsuit]] also allows the skier to do starts in the water where they lie on their back. Unlike a normal life jacket, the \"barefoot wetsuit\" allows the skier to glide on their back on top of the water once they reach a high enough speed. The barefoot wetsuit is generally thicker in the back, rear, and chest for flotation and impact absorption.\n\nBarefoot skiing requires a higher speed because the skier's feet are smaller than skis, providing less lift. A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals the skier's weight in pounds. In other words, a {{convert|175|lb|abbr=on}} person would have to divide 175/10, which is 17.5; then simply add 17.5+18 which equals {{convert|35.5|mph|km/h}}.\n\nAnother tool used in barefoot water skiing is the barefoot boom. It provides a stable aluminum bar on the side of the boat where a short rope can be attached or the skier can grip the bar itself. The skier is within earshot of the people in the boat, providing a good platform for teaching. Once the bare footer is good enough, he/she will go behind the boat with a long rope.\n\nA beginner can wear shoes to decrease the necessary speed, lessen foot injury from choppy water, learn better technique, and master the sport.\n\n===Show skiing===\n[[File:4high.jpg|thumb|right|Water ski pyramid with 18 skiers Lake Zumbro, Minnesota, August 2010]]\nShow skiing is a type of water skiing where skiers perform tricks somewhat similar to those of [[gymnasts]] while being pulled by the boat. Traditional ski show acts include pyramids, ski doubles, freestyle jumping, and swivel skiing. Show skiing is normally performed in water ski shows, with elaborate costumes, choreography, music, and an announcer. Show teams may also compete regionally or nationally. In the US, each team member must be a member of [[USA Water Ski]] to compete.\n\nThe first organized show occurred in 1928.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/showski/ShowSkiHistory.htm | title = National Show Ski Association: A Brief History of Show Skiing | publisher = USA Water Ski | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105211331/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/showski/ShowSkiHistory.htm | archivedate = 5 November 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The bi-annual World Show Ski Championship was inaugurated in September 2012 in Janesville, Wisconsin.<ref name=2014tournament>{{citation | url = http://www.iwsf.com/dbheadlines/headlinefiles/2014%20Show%20Ski%20Tournament.pdf | format = PDF | title = 2014 WORLD SHOW SKI TOURNAMENT | author = Rock Aqua Jays Water Ski Club, Inc. | publisher = International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation | accessdate = 29 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022053225/http://www.iwsf.com/dbheadlines/headlinefiles/2014%20Show%20Ski%20Tournament.pdf | archivedate = 22 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/calendar.html | title = Master Calendar of Events | date = 28 October 2013 | publisher = USA Water Ski | quote = 9/12 - 9/14[2014] &ndash; 2nd IWWF World Show Ski Tournament &ndash; Janesville, Wis. | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020030123/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/calendar.html | archivedate = 20 October 2013 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 29 October 2013 }}</ref> Past competition included teams from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, and the United States.<ref name=2014tournament/>\n\n===Freestyle jumping===\nFreestyle jumping is often related to show skiing. The goal is to go off the jump, perform one of many stunts, and successfully land back on the water. The most common freestyle stunts \u2013 in order of usual progression \u2013 would be a heli (360\u00b0), a flip (forwards), a gainer (a back flip), and a m\u00f6bius (back flip with 360\u00b0).\n\n[[File:Women's round of the Barry Carne Interstate Ski Challenge.jpg|thumb|Ski racing in Australia]]\n\n===Ski racing===\nWater ski racing consists of 1 or 2 skiers per boat who race around a set course behind boats set up for this type of event. It can occur in a 'circle' or lap format type racing - which is the format used for world championship events, held ever four years, or on river courses offering longer distances and higher speeds. Races can be timed events such as 20 minute races and up to 1 hour or on courses where race distance can be over 100&nbsp;km in length.\n\nSpeeds vary by classes but can reach up to 200&nbsp;km/h. Boats can be inboards or outboards and are generally between 19 and 21 feet in length. Outboards are commonly 300HP and Inboards around 1,300HP.\n\nAustralia is the identified home of ski racing, being responsible for some of the world's biggest races, including the world's fastest races, as well as a history of the majority of skier world championships.\n\nCurrent format world championship racing involves men's and women's formula 1 races (unrestricted), and men's and women formula 2 races (limited to single rig, 300&nbsp;hp outboards, as well as junior classes for under 16's.\n\nSome of the biggest races in the world include the Southern 80, in Echuca, Victoria, Australia, the diamond race, in Belgium, the Catalina ski race, in Long Beach, USA, and the Sydney Bridge to Bridge in Sydney, Australia. Races can have anywhere from 10 boats to 150 boats (in classes) competing.\n\n===Marathon===\nThe marathon event consists of each skier having to ski on all 6 pieces of equipment. \n\u2013 Single ski, Double skis, Single, Single finless, Double finless, a freeboard (a ski without bindings), and a fence paling.\n\n===Disabled===\nDisabled water skiing uses equipment or other adaptations to allow disabled people to compete in standard 3 event skiing.  Seated water skis, special handles, audio slalom gear, and other adaptations are all used for different disabilities.\n\n[[File:Sit-ski-slalom.jpg|thumb|a Disabled water skier on a Slalom sit ski]]\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[George A.

Water skiing typically begins with a deep-water start. The skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, have the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water. Most times it can be easier to put the skis on when they are wet. Once the skier has their skis on they will be thrown a tow rope from the boat, which they position between their skis. In the deep-water start, the skier crouches down in the water while holding onto the ski rope; they are in a cannonball position with their legs tucked into their chest, with skis pointing towards the sky and approximately {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} of the ski out of the water. The skier can also perform a \"dry start\" by standing on the shore or a pier; however, this type of entry is recommended for professionals only. When the skier is ready (usually acknowledged by them yelling \"hit it\"), the driver accelerates the boat. As the boat accelerates and takes up the slack on the rope, the skier allows the boat to pull them out of the water by applying some [[muscle strength]] to get them! into an upright body position.\n\nBy leaning back and keeping the legs slightly bent, the skis will eventually plane out and the skier will start to glide over the water. The skier turns by shifting weight left or right. The skier's body weight should be balanced between the balls of the feet and the heels. While being towed, the skier's arms should be relaxed but still fully extended so as to reduce stress on the arms. The handle can be held vertically or horizontally, depending on whichever position is more comfortable for the skier.\n\nIn addition to the driver and the skier, a third person known as the ''spotter'' or the ''observer'' should be present. The spotter's job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls. The spotter usually sits in a chair on the boat facing backwards to see the skier. The skier and the boat's occupants communicate using hand signals (see the [[#Safety measures|Safety]] section below).\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side.jpg|thumb|A privately owned, man-made water ski lake commonly referred to as Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side, located near Orangeville, Ontario seen with a slalom course and jump ramp]]\nWater skiing can take place on any type of water \u2013 such as a river, lake, or ocean \u2013 but calmer waters are ideal for recreational skiing.  There should be a {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} skiing space and the water should be at least {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|1|order=flip}} deep. There must be enough space for the water skier to safely \"get up\", or successfully be in the upright skiing position. Skiers and their boat drivers must also have sufficient room to avoid hazards.\n\n===Skis===\n[[File:Datteln - KF2011 - Ostufer 06 ies.jpg|thumb|Several types of water skis and [[wetsuit]]s]]\nYounger skiers generally start out on children's skis, which consist of two skis tied together at their back and front. These connections mean that less strength is necessary for the child to keep the skis together. Sometimes these skis can come with a handle to help balance the skier as well.<ref name=childrens-skis>{{cite web | title = Children's Waterskis | url = http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-best-childrens-water-skis.html | first = Houlihan | last = Macaco | date = 27 January 2011 | work = Made Manual | publisher = Break Media | accessdate = 23 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195032/http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-best-childrens-water-skis.html | archivedate = 29 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Children's skis are short \u2013 usually {{convert|45|-|60|in|cm|sigfig=2|order=flip}} long<ref name=childrens-skis/> \u2013 reflecting the skier's smaller size.

Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be. Length will also vary based on the type of water skiing being performed; jump skis, for example, are longer than skis used in regular straight-line recreational skiing or competitive slalom and trick skiing. A trick ski is around 40 inches long and wider than combo skis. Again the skier rides it with his or her dominant foot in front. It has no fins which allows for spins to be performed.\n\n===Boat===\n{{hatnote|This section describes water skiing behind a boat. For information about skiing with a cable installation, see the related Wikipedia article on [[cable skiing]].}}\n\nCompetition skiing uses specifically designed towboats. Most towboats have a very small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed in the back of the boat ([[v-drive]]), which creates a bigger wake.

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h|order=flip}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States.\n\nSamuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421022737/http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope was made from a long [[Sash window|window sash]] cord.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment.\n\nThe first patent for water skis was issued to [[Fred Waller]], of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as \"Dolphin Akwa-Skees.\" Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.\n\nIn 1928 [http://www.usawaterskifoundation.org/#!don-ibsen/czd0 Don Ibsen] developed his own water skis on the West Coast, never having heard of Samuelson or Waller. In 1941 Don Ibsen founded The Olympic Water Ski Club in Seattle, WA. It was the first such club in America. Ibsen, a showman and entrepreneur, was one of the earliest manufacturers of water skis and was a leading enthusiast and promoter of the sport. In 1983 he was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in Winterhaven, FL.\n\nThe sport of water skiing remained an obscure activity for several years after 1922, until Samuelson performed water ski shows from Michigan to Florida. The American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson in 1966 as the first recorded water skier in history. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, slalom skier, and the first organizer of a water ski show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph W.

Pope cultivated a distinct image for his theme-park, which included countless photographs of the water skiers featured at the park. These photographs began appearing in magazines worldwide in the 1940s and 1950s, helping to bring international attention to the sport for the first time.<ref>The Lakeland Ledger, 29 January 1988.

Both men are in the [[Water Ski Hall of Fame and Museum|Water Ski Hall of Fame]]. Today, Winter Haven, Florida, with its famous [[Chain of Lakes (Winter Haven)|Chain of Lakes]], remains an important city for water skiing, with several major ski schools operating there.\n\nWater skiing has developed over time. Water skiing tournaments and water skiing competitions have been organized. As an exhibition sport, water skiing was included in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. The first National Show Ski Tournament was held in 1974, and the first ever National Intercollegiate Water Ski Championships were held in 1979. The Home CARE US National Water Ski Challenge, the first competition for people with disabilities, was organized ten years later.\n\nThe first patented design of a water ski which included carbon fiber was that of Hani Audah at SPORT labs in 2001.

Slalom skis are narrow and long, at {{convert|57|-|70|in|cm|0}} depending on the height and weight of the skier. The two forward-facing bindings vary: they can be made of rubber or thick plastic, and they can be designed more like a [[Ski binding|snow ski binding]] or more like a [[Inline skates|roller blade boot]].\n\nSlalom skiing involves a multi-buoy course that the skier must go around in order to complete the pass. A complete slalom water ski course consists of 26 buoys. There are entrance gates at the beginning and end of the course that the skier must go between, and there are 6 turn buoys that the skier must navigate around in a zigzag pattern. The remainder of the buoys are for the driver to ensure the boat goes straight down the center of the course. For a tournament to be sanctioned as 'record capable' by the [[International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation]] (IWWF), the entire course must be surveyed prior to competition by a land surveyor to ensure its accuracy. The drivers boat path must be verified as well to ensure that all skiers are getting a fair pull.\n\nEvery consecutive<ref name=iwsf-history/> pass is harder than the pass before it. When a pass is completed, the boat is sped up by {{convert|3|km/h|mph|0}} until the maximum speed has been reached for the division, based on the skier's gender and age ({{convert|55|km/h|mph|0}} for women and {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} for men). After the skier has run their maximum speed pass, the rope is shortened at specific increments to make it more difficult to reach the buoy width. In a tournament, the boat speeds up or the rope shortens until the skier fails to complete the slalom course by falling or not getting around a buoy.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nA skier's score is based upon the number of successful buoys cleared, the speed of the boat, and the length of the rope. In a tournament, skiers choose the starting boat speed and rope length (with a maximum length of {{convert|22.86|m|ft|0}}). Professional water skiers will typically start at the max speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} with a rope that has already been shortened to {{convert|13|m|ft}}. The skier with the most buoys wins the competition.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nThe turn buoys are positioned {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} away from the center of the slalom course so as the rope is shortened beyond that the skiers are required to use the momentum generated through their turns to swing up on the side of the boat and reach out in order to get their ski around the next buoy. At this rope length the skier's body is experiencing intense isometric contractions and extreme upper body torque with loads of up to 600&nbsp;kg as they begin accelerating after rounding a turn buoy. Their top speeds will generally be more than double the boat's speed, which means that the Pro men can reach speeds in excess of {{convert|116|km/h|mph}} and each turn will generally generate around 4 [[g-force|g of force]]. Essentially, slalom water skiers are using their body as a lever, which allows them to withstand loads that would otherwise not be possible for the human body.\n\n====Jump====\n\nWater ski jumpers use two long skis to ride over a water ski jump in an attempt to travel the longest distance. In a tournament, skiers are given three attempts to hit the ramp. The winner is the skier who travels the farthest calculated<ref name=manual-2003/> distance and successfully rides away.<ref name=ripnride>{{cite web|title=Jump Gold|work=Rip 'n Ride|publisher=Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada|url=http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|accessdate=1 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222034/http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are no style points, simply distance.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nWater ski jumps have specific dimensions and the ramp height is adjustable. Skiers may choose their boat speed and ramp height, although there are maximums based the skier's gender and age. Professional ski jumpers have a maximum boat speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}}. The ramp height must be between {{convert|5|and|6|ft|m|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. As a professional jumper approaches the ramp they will zigzag behind the boat in a series of cuts<ref name=ripnride/> to generate speed and angle. When the jumper hits the ramp they will generally be going over {{convert|112|km/h|mph|0}} and the load they have generated on the rope can be over {{convert|600|kg|lb}}.\n\n====Trick====\n[[File:Fischlham Mevisto Cup 2017 Trickski Theresa Schmidberger1-1.jpg|thumb|A competitor at a trick skiing event in Austria in 2017]]\nThe Trick competition has been described as the most technical of the three classic water skiing events.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nTrick skiing uses small, oval-shaped or oblong water skis. Beginners generally use two skis while more advanced skiers use one.<ref name=iwsf-history/> The shorter, wider Trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45\u00b0. It has a smooth bottom that allows it to turn over the surface of the water. According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event competition in the United States and the Pan-Am Games, skis used in the Tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} are allowed, as are a foot pad cemented to the ski as a place for the rear foot; in addition, the ski must float with all bindings, fins, etc., installed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The ski's configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.\n\nIn a tournament, skiers are given two 20-second runs during which they perform a series of their chosen tricks. In most cases, one pass is for hand tricks, which includes surface turns, rotations over the wake, and flips. The second pass is for toe tricks, which are done by doing wake turns and rotations with only a foot attaching them to the handle; the foot is either in the toehold part of the handle or, professionally, attached to the rope. <ref name=iwsf-history/>The toehold part of the handle does not allow the skier to let go of the handle if they lose their balance and fall into the water, therefore a person in the boat is required to release the rope from the boat using a quick release mechanism installed on the ski pylon. A trick cannot be repeated.<ref name=iwsf-history/> Each trick has a point value. A panel of five judges assesses which tricks were completed correctly and assigns that predetermined point value to each successfully completed trick. The skier with the most points wins.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\n===Barefoot water skiing===\n[[File:Barefoot Waterskier Michael French.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barefoot skiing]] on [[Lake Ozonia]] in the Adirondacks]]\n{{main|Barefoot skiing}}\nA barefoot water skier should use a [[wetsuit]] instead of a [[life jacket]] because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed. The [[wetsuit]] also allows the skier to do starts in the water where they lie on their back. Unlike a normal life jacket, the \"barefoot wetsuit\" allows the skier to glide on their back on top of the water once they reach a high enough speed. The barefoot wetsuit is generally thicker in the back, rear, and chest for flotation and impact absorption.\n\nBarefoot skiing requires a higher speed because the skier's feet are smaller than skis, providing less lift. A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals the skier's weight in pounds. In other words, a {{convert|175|lb|abbr=on}} person would have to divide 175/10, which is 17.5; then simply add 17.5+18 which equals {{convert|35.5|mph|km/h}}.\n\nAnother tool used in barefoot water skiing is the barefoot boom. It provides a stable aluminum bar on the side of the boat where a short rope can be attached or the skier can grip the bar itself. The skier is within earshot of the people in the boat, providing a good platform for teaching. Once the bare footer is good enough, he/she will go behind the boat with a long rope.\n\nA beginner can wear shoes to decrease the necessary speed, lessen foot injury from choppy water, learn better technique, and master the sport.\n\n===Show skiing===\n[[File:4high.jpg|thumb|right|Water ski pyramid with 18 skiers Lake Zumbro, Minnesota, August 2010]]\nShow skiing is a type of water skiing where skiers perform tricks somewhat similar to those of [[gymnasts]] while being pulled by the boat. Traditional ski show acts include pyramids, ski doubles, freestyle jumping, and swivel skiing. Show skiing is normally performed in water ski shows, with elaborate costumes, choreography, music, and an announcer. Show teams may also compete regionally or nationally.
