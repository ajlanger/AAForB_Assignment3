{"title_page": "Head-directionality parameter", "text_new": "{{Linguistics}}\nIn [[linguistics]], '''head directionality ''' is a proposed [[Principles and parameters|parameter]] that classifies languages according to whether they are '''head-initial''' (the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[phrase]] precedes its  [[Complement (linguistics)|complements]]) or '''head-final''' (the head follows its complements). The [[Head (linguistics)|head]] is the element that determines the category of a phrase: for example, in a [[verb phrase]], the head is a verb.\n\nSome languages are consistently head-initial or head-final at all phrasal levels. [[English grammar|English]] is considered to be strongly head-initial, while [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is an example of a language that is consistently head-final. In certain other languages, such as [[German language|German]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]], examples of both types of head direction occur. Various theories have been proposed to explain such variation.\n\nHead directionality is connected with the type of [[branching (linguistics)|branching]] that predominates in a language: head-initial structures are ''right-branching'', while head-final structures are ''left-branching''.{{sfn|Dryer|2009}}\n\n== Types of phrase ==\nThere are various types of phrase in which the ordering of head and complement(s) may be considered when attempting to determine the head directionality of a language, including:\n#[[Verb phrase]] (VP). Here the head is a [[verb]], and the complement(s) are most commonly [[object (grammar)|object]]s of various types. The ordering here is related to one of the chief questions in the [[word order]] typology of languages, namely the normal order of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], verb and object within a [[clause (grammar)|clause]] (languages are classed on this basis as [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]], SOV, VSO, etc.). \n#[[Noun phrase]] (NP). Here the head is a [[noun]]; various kinds of complementizer phrase and adpositional phrase may be considered to be complements.\n#[[Adjective phrase]] (AP). This contains an adjective as the head, and can take as a complement, for example, an [[adverbial phrase]] or adpositional phrase.\n# [[Adpositional phrase]] (PP). Such phrases are called prepositional phrases if they are head-initial (i.e. headed by a preposition), or postpositional phrases if they are head-final (i.e. headed by a postposition). For more on these, see [[Preposition and postposition]]. The complement is a determiner phrase (or noun phrase, depending on analytical scheme followed).\n# [[Determiner phrase]] (DP). This has a [[determiner]] as the head of the phrase. DPs were proposed under generative syntax;{{sfn|Szabolcsi|1983}} not all theories of syntax agree that they exist.{{sfn|Van Langendonck|1994}} \n#[[Complementizer phrase]] (CP). This contains a [[complementizer]], like ''that'' in English, as the head. In some cases the head is [[covert (linguistics)|covert]] (not overtly present). The complement can be considered to be a tense phrase.\n#[[Tense phrase]] (TP) and [[aspect phrase]] (AspP). These are phrases in which the head is an abstract [[syntactic category|category]] representing [[grammatical tense|tense]] or [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]; the complement is a verb phrase. In more traditional analysis the entire phrase (including any elements denoting tense or aspect) is considered to be simply a verb phrase.\n\nIn some cases, particularly with noun and adjective phrases, it is not always clear which dependents are to be classed as complements, and which as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s. Although in principle the head-directionality parameter concerns the order of heads and complements only, considerations of head-initiality and head-finality sometimes take account of the position of the head in the phrase as a whole, including adjuncts. The structure of the various types of phrase is analyzed below in relation to specific languages, with a focus on the ordering of head and complement. In some cases (such as English and Japanese) this ordering is found to be the same in practically all types of phrase, whereas in others (such as German and Gbe) the pattern is less consistent. Different theoretical explanations of these inconsistencies are discussed later in the article.\n\n==Particular languages==\n\n===English===\n[[English grammar|English]] is a strongly head-initial language. In a typical verb phrase, for example, the verb precedes its complements, as in the following example:{{sfn|Fukui|1994|p=4}}\n[[File:VP English.png|framed|right|English VP structure]]\n:''eat an apple''\n:[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>'''V'''</sub> '''eat'''] [<sub>DP</sub> an apple]]\n\nThe head of the phrase (the verb ''eat'') precedes its complement (the determiner phrase ''an apple''). Switching the order to \"[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> an apple] [<sub>V</sub> eat]]\" would be ungrammatical.\n\nNouns also tend to precede any complements, as in the following example, where the [[relative clause]] (or [[complementizer phrase]]) that follows the noun may be considered to be a complement:{{sfn|Smith|1964|p=6}}\n[[File:NP English.png|thumb|English NP structure]]\n:''He married a girl who is from Texas.''\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>'''N'''</sub> '''girl'''] [<sub>CP</sub> who is from Texas]]\n\nNouns do not necessarily begin their phrase; they may be preceded by [[attributive adjective]]s, but these are regarded as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s rather than complements. (For preceding [[determiner]]s, see below.) Adjectives themselves may be preceded by adjuncts, namely [[adverb]]s, as in ''extremely happy''.{{sfn|Sadler & Arnold|1994|pp=28\u201334}} However, when an adjective phrase contains a true complement, such as a prepositional phrase, the head adjective precedes it:{{sfn|Sadler & Arnold|1994|pp=28}}\n:''a person happy about her work''\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>'''A'''</sub> '''happy'''] [<sub>PP</sub> about her work]]\n\nEnglish adpositional phrases are also head-initial; that is, English has [[preposition]]s rather than postpositions:{{sfn|Gillion|1992|p=15}}\n[[File:PP English.png|framed|right|English PP structure]]\n:''a majority of eligible voters''\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>'''P'''</sub> '''of'''] [<sub>DP</sub> eligible voters]]\n\nOn the [[determiner phrase]] (DP) view, where a [[determiner]] is taken to be the head of its phrase (rather than the associated noun), English can be seen to be head-initial in this type of phrase too. In the following example{{sfn|Takahashi|2002|p=2}} the head is taken to be the determiner ''any'', and the complement is the noun (phrase) ''book'':\n\n[[File:DP English.png|framed|right|English DP structure]]\n:''any book''\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>'''D'''</sub> '''any'''] [<sub>NP</sub> book]]\n\nEnglish also has head-initial [[complementizer phrase]]s, as in this example{{sfn|Sells|1995|p=4}} where the complementizer ''that'' precedes its complement, the tense phrase ''Mary did not swim'':\n:''We saw that Mary did not swim''\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>'''C'''</sub> '''that'''] [<sub>TP</sub> Mary did not swim]]\n\nGrammatical words marking tense and aspect generally precede the semantic verb. This indicates that, if finite verb phrases are analyzed as [[tense phrase]]s or aspect phrases, these are again head-initial in English. In the example above, ''did'' is considered a ([[past tense|past]]) tense marker, and precedes its complement, the verb phrase ''not swim''. In the following, ''has'' is a ([[perfect aspect|perfect]]) aspect marker;{{sfn|Lin|2003|p=2}} again it appears before the verb (phrase) which is its complement.\n[[File:AsP English.png|thumb|right|English AspP Structure]]\n:''John has arrived''\n:[<sub>AspP</sub> [<sub>Asp</sub> '''has'''] [<sub>VP</sub> arrived]]\n\nThe following example shows a sequence of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement.{{sfn|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014}} In the [[complementizer phrase]] (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the [[tense phrase]] in (b), the [[grammatical tense|tense]]-marking element (T) precedes its verb phrase (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, ''the girl'', is a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], which does not need to be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the [[verb phrase]] in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the determiner phrase (DP) ''the book'' and the prepositional phrase (PP) ''on the table''. In (d), where ''a picture'' is analyzed as a determiner phrase, the determiner (D) ''a'' precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the [[preposition]] (P) ''on'' precedes its DP complement ''your desk''.\n:''You know that the girl will put a picture on your desk.''\n:a. CP: [<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>C</sub> '''''that''''' ]  [<sub>TP</sub> ''the girl will put a picture on your desk'' ] ]\n:b. TP: [<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>T</sub> '''''will''''' ]  [<sub>VP</sub> ''put a picture on your desk'' ] ]\n:c. VP: [<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>V</sub> '''''put''''' ]   [<sub>DP</sub> ''a picture'' ] [<sub>PP</sub> ''on your desk'' ] ]\n:d. DP: [<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>D</sub> '''''a''''' ]     [<sub>NP</sub> ''picture'' ] ]\n:e. PP: [<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>P</sub> '''''on''''' ]    [<sub>DP</sub> ''your desk'' ] ]\n\n===German===\n{{cleanup|section|reason=See talk page, section \"Mistakes...\"|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[German grammar|German]], while being predominantly head-initial, is less conclusively so than in the case of English. German also features certain head-final structures. For example, in a [[nonfinite verb|nonfinite]] verb phrase the verb is final. In a finite verb phrase (or tense/aspect phrase) the verb (tense/aspect) is initial, although it may move to final position in a [[subordinate clause]]. In the following example,{{sfn|Dopke|1998|p=6}}  the non-finite verb phrase ''es finden'' is head-final, whereas in the tensed main clause ''ich werde es finden'' (headed by the [[auxiliary verb]] ''werde'' indicating [[future tense]]), the finite auxiliary precedes its complement (as an instance of a [[verb-second]] construction; in the example below, this V2-position is called \"T\"). \n[[File:VP Head Final German.png|thumb|right|German VP structure]]\n:''Ich werde es finden''\n:I   will  it find\n:\"I will find it.\"\n:[<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> Ich] [<sub>T</sub> '''werde'''] [<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> es] [<sub>'''V'''</sub> '''finden''']]]\n\nNoun phrases containing complements are head-initial; in this example{{sfn|Berthold|2005|p=6}} the complement, the CP ''der den Befehl \u00fcberbrachte'', follows the head noun ''Boten''.\n:''Man beschimpfte den Boten,    der den Befehl  \u00fcberbrachte''\n:one insulted    the messenger who the command delivered\n:\"The messenger, who delivered the command, was insulted.\"\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>N</sub> '''Boten'''] [<sub>CP</sub> der den Befehl \u00fcberbrachte]]\n\nAdjective phrases may be head-final or head-initial. In the next example the adjective (''stolze'') follows its complement (''auf seine Kinder'').{{sfn|Hinterh\u00f6lzl|2010|p=4}}\n[[File:AP Final German.png|thumb|right|German head-final AP Structure]]\n:''der auf seine Kinder stolze Vater''\n:the of his children proud father\n:\"the father (who is) proud of his children\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>PP</sub> auf seine Kinder] [<sub>A</sub> '''stolze''']]\n\nHowever, when essentially the same adjective phrase is used [[predicative adjective|predicatively]] rather than attributively, it can also be head-initial:{{sfn|Hinterh\u00f6lzl|2010|p=5}}\n[[File:AP Initial German.png|thumb|right|German head-initial AP Structure]]\n:''weil er stolz auf seine Kinder ist''\n:since he proud of his children is\n:\"since he is proud of his children\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>A</sub> '''stolz'''] [<sub>PP</sub> auf seine Kinder]]\n\nMost adpositional phrases are head-initial (as German has mostly prepositions rather than postpositions), as in the following example, where ''auf'' comes before its complement ''den Tisch'':{{sfn|Van Riemsdijk|2007|p=3}}\n[[File:PP Initial German.png|thumb|right|German head-initial PP structure]]\n:''Peter legt das Buch auf den Tisch''\n:Peter puts the book on the.ACC table\n:\"Peter puts the book on the table.\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>P</sub> '''auf'''] [<sub>DP</sub> den Tisch]]\n\nGerman also has some [[postposition]]s, however (such as ''gegen\u00fcber'' \"opposite\"), and so adpositional phrases can also sometimes be head-final. Another example is provided by the analysis of the following sentence:{{sfn|Van Riemsdijk|2007|p=1}} \n:''Die Schnecke kroch das Dach hinauf''\n:the snail crept the roof up\n:\"The snail crept up the roof\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> das Dach] [<sub>P</sub> '''hinauf''']]\n\nLike in English, determiner phrases and complementizer phrases in German are head-initial. The next example is of a determiner phrase, headed by the article ''der'':{{sfn|Bianchi|1999|p=251}}\n[[File:CP German.png|thumb|right|German CP Structure]]\n:''der Mann''\n:the man\n:\"the man\"\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>D</sub> '''der'''] [<sub>NP</sub> Mann]]\n\nIn the following example, the complementizer ''dass'' precedes the tense phrase which serves as its complement:{{sfn|Kathol|2001|p=1}}\n:''dass Lisa eine Blume gepflanzt hat''\n:that Lisa a flower planted has\n:\"that Lisa planted a flower\"\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>C</sub> '''dass'''] [<sub>TP</sub> Lisa eine Blume gepflanzt hat]]\n\n===Japanese===\nJapanese is an example of a strongly head-final language. This can be seen in verb phrases and tense phrases: the verb (''tabe'' in the example) comes after its complement, while the tense marker (''ru'') comes after the whole verb phrase which is its complement.{{sfn|Fukui|1994|p=4}}\n[[File:VP Japanese.png|framed|right|Japanese VP structure]]\n:''ringo-o   tabe-ru''\n:apple-ACC eat-NONPAST\n:\"eat an apple\"\n:[<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> ringo-o] [<sub>V</sub> '''tabe''']] [<sub>T</sub> '''ru''']]\n\nNouns also typically come after any complements, as in the following example where the PP ''New York-de-no'' may be regarded as a complement:{{sfn|Naoki|1993|pp=15\u201316}}\n[[File:NP Japanese.png|thumb|right|Japanese NP structure]]\n:''John-no  kinoo-no      New York-de-no  koogi''\n:John-GEN yesterday-GEN New York-in-GEN lecture\n:\"John's lecture in New York yesterday\"\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>PP</sub> New York-de-no] [<sub>N</sub> '''koogi''']]\n\nAdjectives also follow any complements they may have. In this example the complement of quantity, ''ni-juu-meetoro'' (\"twenty meters\"), precedes the head adjective ''takai'' (\"tall\"):{{sfn|Watanabe|2011|pp=9\u201310}}\n:''Kono biru-wa      ni-juu-meetoru takai''\n:this building-TOPIC two-ten-meter  tall\n:\"This building is twenty meters taller.\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>Q</sub> ni-juu-meetoru] [<sub>A</sub> '''takai''']]\n\nJapanese uses postpositions rather than prepositions, so its adpositional phrases are again head-final:{{sfn|Vinka|2009|p=4}}\n[[File:PP Japanese.png|thumb|right|Japanese PP structure]]\n:''Boku-ga Takasu-mura-ni    sunde-iru''\n:I-NOM   Takasu-village-in live-PRES\n:\"I live in Takasu village.\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> Takasu-mura] [<sub>P</sub> '''ni''']]\n\nDeterminer phrases are head-final as well:{{sfn|Takahashi|2002|p=2}}\n[[File:DP Japanese.png|framed|right|Japanese DP structure]]\n:''dare mo''\n:person any\n:\"anyone\"\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> dare] [<sub>D</sub> '''mo''']]\n\nA complementizer (here ''to'', equivalent to English \"that\") comes after its complement (here a tense phrase meaning \"Mary did not swim\"), thus Japanese complementizer phrases are head-final:{{sfn|Sells|1995|p=4}} \n:''Mary-ga  oyog-ana-katta-to''\n:Mary-NOM swim-NEG-PAST-that\n:\"that Mary did not swim\"\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>TP</sub> Mary-ga oyog-ana-katta] [<sub>C</sub> '''to''']]\n\n===Chinese===\n[[Standard Chinese]] (whose syntax is typical of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] generally) features a mixture of head-final and head-initial structures. Noun phrases are head-final. Modifiers virtually always precede the noun they modify. For examples of this involving relative clauses, see {{Section link|Relative clause|Mandarin}}.\n\nIn the case of strict head/complement ordering, however, Chinese appears to be head-initial. Verbs normally precede their objects. Both prepositions and postpositions are reported, but the postpositions can be analyzed as a type of noun (the prepositions are often called [[coverb]]s). For more details and examples of the relevant structures, see [[Chinese grammar]]. For a head-direction analysis of Chinese aspect phrases, see the theoretical section below.\n\n===Gbe===\nIn [[Gbe languages|Gbe]], a mixture of head-initial and head-final structures is found. For example, a verb may appear after or before its complement, which means that both head-initial and head-final verb phrases occur.{{sfn|Aboh|2001|pp=1\u20132}} In the first example the verb for \"use\" appears after its complement:\n:''K\u0254\u0300j\u00f3 t\u00f3     \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301  z\u00e2n''\n:Kojo IMPERF oil DET use\n:\"Kojo is using the oil.\"\n:[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301] [<sub>V</sub> '''z\u00e2n''']]\n\nIn the second example the verb precedes the complement:\n:''K\u0254\u0300j\u00f3 n\u0254\u0300  z\u00e1n      \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301''\n:Kojo HAB use-PERF oil DET\n:\"Kojo habitually used the oil/Kojo habitually uses the oil.\"\n:[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>V</sub> '''z\u00e1n'''] [<sub>DP</sub> \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301]]\n\nIt has been debated whether the first example is due to object [[syntactic movement|movement]] to the left side of the verb {{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=2}} or whether the lexical entry of the verb simply allows head-initial and head-final structures.{{sfn|Kinyalolo|1992|pp=1\u201316}}\n\nTense phrases and aspect phrases are head-initial since aspect markers (such as ''t\u00f3'' and ''n\u0254\u0300 '' above) and tense markers (such as the future marker ''n\u00e1'' in the following example, but that does not apply to tense markers shown by verb [[inflection]]) come before the verb phrase.{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=34}}\n:''d\u00e0w\u00e9 l\u0254\u0300   n\u00e1 x\u0254\u0300   k\u025b\u0300k\u025b\u0301''\n:man DET FUT buy bicycle\n:\"The man will buy a bicycle.\"\n:[<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>T</sub> '''n\u00e1'''] [<sub>VP</sub> x\u0254\u0300 k\u025b\u0300k\u025b\u0301]]\n\nGbe noun phrases are typically head-final, as in this example:{{sfn|Brousseau & Lumsden|1992|p=4}}\n[[File:NP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe NP structure]]\n:''K\u0254\u0300k\u00fa s\u00edn  \u0256\u00ecd\u00e8   l\u025b\u0300''\n:Koku-CASE sketch-PL\n:\"sketches of Koku\"\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>KP</sub> K\u0254\u0300k\u00fa s\u00edn] [<sub>N</sub> '''\u0256\u00ecd\u00e8''']]\n\nIn the following example of an adjective phrase, Gbe follows a head-initial pattern, as the head ''y\u00f9'' precedes the [[intensifier]] ''t\u00e0\u00f9\u00fa''.{{sfn|Aboh|2004}}\n[[File:AP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe AP structure]]\n:''\u00e0\u01d4n  y\u00f9 t\u00e0\u00f9\u00fa''\n:dog black-Int\n:\"really black dogs\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>A</sub> '''y\u00f9'''] [<sub>Int</sub> t\u00e0\u00f9\u00fa]]\n\nGbe adpositional phrases are head-initial, with prepositions preceding their complement:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=117}}\n:''K\u00f2fi     z\u00e9        kw\u025b\u0301      xl\u00e1n  \u00c0s\u00edb\u00e1\"\n:Kofi   take-PERF money    to Asiba\n:\"Kofi sent money to Asiba.\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>P</sub> '''xl\u00e1n'''] [<sub>DP</sub> \u00c0s\u00edb\u00e1]]\n\nDeterminer phrases, however, are head-final:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=100}}\n[[File:CP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe CP structure]]\n:''As\u00edb\u00e1   x\u0254\u0300        \u00e0v\u0254\u0300   \u00e0m\u00e0m\u00fa  m\u00e0t\u00e0n-m\u00e0t\u00e0n        \u0256\u00e9''\n:Asiba buy-PERF cloth   green    odd             DEF\n:\"Asiba bought a specific ugly green cloth\"\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> \u00e0v\u0254\u0300 \u00e0m\u00e0m\u00fa m\u00e0t\u00e0n-m\u00e0t\u00e0n] [<sub>D</sub> '''\u0256\u00e9''']]\n\nComplementizer phrases are head-initial:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=348}} \n:''\u0256\u00e9   D\u00f2s\u00e0    gb\u00e1      xw\u00e9   \u0254\u0300        \u0254\u0300''\n:that Dosa build-PERF house DEF DET\n:\"that Dosa built the house\"\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>C</sub> '''\u0256\u00e9'''] [<sub>TP</sub> D\u00f2s\u00e0 gb xw\u00e9 \u0254\u0300 \u0254\u0300]]\n\n==Theoretical views==\nThe idea that syntactic structures reduce to binary relations was introduced by [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] within the framework of [[dependency grammar|dependency theory]], which was developed during the 1960s. Tesni\u00e8re distinguished two structures that differ in the placement of the structurally governing element ([[head (grammar)|head]]):{{sfn|Graffi|2001|pp=197\u2013198}} '''centripetal structures''', in which heads precede their [[dependent (grammar)|dependent]]s, and '''centrifugal structures''', in which heads follow their dependents. Dependents here may include [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s, [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]], and [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]]s.\n\n[[Joseph Greenberg]], who worked in the field of [[language typology]], put forward an implicational theory of [[word order]], whereby:{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=2}}\n*If a language has VO (verb-before-object) ordering, then it will also have [[preposition]]s (rather than postpositions), and genitives and adjectives will be placed after the noun they modify.\n*If a language has OV ordering, then it will also have postpositions, and genitives and adjectives will be placed before the noun they modify.\nThe first set of properties make heads come at the start of their phrases, while the second set make heads come at the end. However, it has been claimed that many languages (such as [[Basque language|Basque]]) do not fulfill the above conditions, and that Greenberg's theory fails to predict the exceptions.{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=5}}\n\n[[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[Principles and Parameters theory]] in the 1980s{{sfn|Chomsky|1981}} introduced the idea that a small number of innate principles are common to every human language (e.g. phrases are oriented around heads), and that these general principles are subject to parametric variation (e.g. the order of heads and other phrasal components may differ). In this theory, the dependency relation between heads, complements, specifiers, and adjuncts is regulated by [[X-bar theory]], proposed by Jackendoff{{sfn|Jackendoff|1977}} in the 1970s. The complement is sister to the head, and they can be ordered in one of two ways. A head-complement order is called a '''head-initial structure''', while a complement-head order is called a '''head-final structure'''. These are special cases of Tesni\u00e8re's centripetal and centrifugal structures, since here only complements are considered, whereas Tesni\u00e8re considered all types of dependents.\n\nIn the principles and parameters theory, a head-directionality parameter is proposed as a way of [[linguistic typology|classifying languages]]. A language which has head-initial structures is considered to be a '''head-initial language''', and one which has head-final structures is considered to be a '''head-final language'''. It is found, however, that very few, if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other. Linguists have come up with a number of theories to explain the inconsistencies, sometimes positing a more consistent [[underlying representation|underlying]] order, with the phenomenon of phrasal [[syntactic movement|movement]] being used to explain the surface deviations.\n\nAccording to the [[Antisymmetry]] theory proposed by [[Richard Kayne]], there is no head-directionality parameter as such: it is claimed that at an underlying level, all languages are head-initial. In fact, it is argued that all languages have the underlying order Specifier-Head-Complement. Deviations from this order are accounted for by different [[syntactic movement]]s applied by languages. Kayne argues that a theory that allows both directionalities would imply an absence of [[asymmetry|asymmetries]] between languages, whereas in fact languages fail to be symmetrical in many respects. Kayne argues using the concept of a probe-goal search (based on the ideas of the [[Minimalist program]]), whereby a [[Head (linguistics)|head]] acts as a probe and looks for a goal, namely its [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]. Kayne proposes that the direction of the probe-goal search must share the direction of language [[parsing]] and production.{{sfn|Kayne|2011|p=12}} Parsing and production proceed in a left-to-right direction: the beginning of sentence is heard or spoken first, and the end of the sentence is heard or spoken last. This implies (according to the theory) an ordering whereby probe comes before goal, i.e. head precedes complement.\n\nSome linguists have rejected the conclusions of the Antisymmetry approach. Some have pointed out that in predominantly head-final languages such as [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] and [[Basque grammar|Basque]], the change from an underlying head-initial form to a largely head-final surface form would involve complex and massive leftward movement, which is not in accordance with the ideal of grammatical simplicity.{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=5}} Some take a \"surface true\" viewpoint: that analysis of head direction must take place at the level of [[surface form|surface derivations]], or even the [[Phonetic Form]] (PF), i.e. the order in which sentences are pronounced in natural speech. This rejects the idea of an underlying ordering which is then subject to movement, as posited in Antisymmetry and in certain other approaches. It has been argued that a head parameter must only reside at PF, as it is unmaintainable in its original form as a structural parameter.{{sfn|Richards|2008|p=283}}\n\nSome linguists have provided evidence which may be taken to support Kayne's scheme, such as Lin,{{sfn|Lin|2006}} who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the [[Chinese grammar#Particles|sentence-final particle]] ''le''. Certain restrictions on movement from within verb phrases preceding such a particle are found (if various other assumptions from the literature are accepted) to be consistent with the idea that the verb phrase has moved from its underlying position after its head (the particle ''le'' here being taken as the head of an [[aspect phrase]]). However, Takita (2009) observes that similar restrictions do not apply in Japanese, in spite of its surface head-final character, concluding that if Lin's assumptions are correct, then Japanese must be considered to be a true head-final language, contrary to the main tenet of Antisymmetry.{{sfn|Takita|2009|pp=59}} More details about these arguments can be found in the [[Antisymmetry]] article.\n\n==Statistical classifications==\n\nSome scholars, such as Tesni\u00e8re, argue that there are no absolute head-initial or head-final languages. According to this approach, it is true that some languages have more head-initial or head-final elements than other languages do, but almost any language contains both head-initial and head-final elements.  Therefore, rather than being classifiable into fixed categories, languages can be arranged on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] with head-initial and head-final as the extremes, based on the frequency distribution of their [[Dependency grammar|dependency]] directions. This view was supported in a study by Haitao Liu (2010), who investigated 20 languages using a dependency [[treebank]]-based method.{{sfn|Liu|2010|pp=1567\u20131578}} For instance, Japanese is close to the head-final end of the continuum, while English and German, which have mixed head-initial and head-final dependencies, are plotted in relatively intermediate positions on the continuum.\n\nPolinsky (2012) identified the following five head-directionality sub-types:\n* Rigid head-final languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]];\n* Non-rigid head-final languages, including [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Tsez language|Tsez]] and [[Avar language|Avar]];\n* Clearly head-initial languages, including [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Tongan language|Tongan]] and most [[Mayan languages]];\n* \"SVO/head-initial\" languages, including [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Yucatec Mayan]];\n* \"SVO sundry\", including [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[Romance languages]] and [[Bantu languages]].\n\nShe identified a strong correlation between the head-directionality type of a language and the ratio of verbs to nouns in the lexical inventory. Languages with a scarcity of simple verbs tend to be rigidly head-final, as in the case of Japanese, whereas verb-rich languages tend to be head-initial languages.{{sfn|Polinsky|2012|pp=348-359}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Dependent-marking language]]\n*[[Double-marking language]]\n*[[Government (linguistics)]]\n*[[Government and binding theory]]\n*[[Head (linguistics)]]\n*[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Head-marking language]]\n*[[Minimalist grammar]]\n*[[Transformational grammar]]\n*[[Word order]]\n*[[Zero-marking language]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite journal|ref = harv|last1=Aboh|first1=Enoch|title=Object shift and verb movement in Gbe|journal=Generative Grammar in Geneva|date=2001|volume=2|pages=1\u201313|url=http://www.unige.ch/lettres/linge/syntaxe/journal/2/1.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}\n* {{cite book|ref = harv|last1=Aboh|first1=Enoch|title=The morphosyntax of complement-head sequences: Clause structure and word order patterns in kwa|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{cite book|ref = harv|last1=Bianchi|first1=Valentina|title=Consequences of antisymmetry: Headed relative clauses.|date=1999|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}\n* {{cite book|ref = harv|last1=Broekhuis|first1=H|title=Syntax of Dutch: Adjectives and Adjective Phrases|date=2013|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam}}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Brousseau | first1 = Anne-Marie | last2 = Lumsden | first2 = John S | year = 1992 | title = Nominal structures in Fongbe | url = | journal = Journal of West African Languages | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201322 }}\n*[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]].

The [[Head (linguistics)|head]] is the element that determines the category of a phrase: for example, in a [[verb phrase]], the head is a verb.\n\nSome languages are consistently head-initial or head-final at all phrasal levels. [[English grammar|English]] is considered to be strongly head-initial, while [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is an example of a language that is consistently head-final. In certain other languages, such as [[German language|German]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]], examples of both types of head direction occur. Various theories have been proposed to explain such variation.\n\nHead directionality is connected with the type of [[branching (linguistics)|branching]] that predominates in a language: head-initial structures are ''right-branching'', while head-final structures are ''left-branching''.{{sfn|Dryer|2009}}\n\n== Types of phrase ==\nThere are various types of phrase in which the ordering of head and complement(s) may be considered when attempting to determine the head directionality of a language, including:\n#[[Verb phrase]] (VP). Here the head is a [[verb]], and the complement(s) are most commonly [[object (grammar)|object]]s of various types. The ordering here is related to one of the chief questions in the [[word order]] typology of languages, namely the normal order of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], verb and object within a [[clause (grammar)|clause]] (languages are classed on this basis as [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]], SOV, VSO, etc.). \n#[[Noun phrase]] (NP). Here the head is a [[noun]]; various kinds of complementizer phrase and adpositional phrase may be considered to be complements.\n#[[Adjective phrase]] (AP). This contains an adjective as the head, and can take as a complement, for example, an [[adverbial phrase]] or adpositional phrase.\n# [[Adpositional phrase]] (PP). Such phrases are called prepositional phrases if they are head-initial (i.e. headed by a preposition), or postpositional phrases if they are head-final (i.e. headed by a postposition). For more on these, see [[Preposition and postposition]]. The complement is a determiner phrase (or noun phrase, depending on analytical scheme followed).\n# [[Determiner phrase]] (DP). This has a [[determiner]] as the head of the phrase. DPs were proposed under generative syntax;{{sfn|Szabolcsi|1983}} not all theories of syntax agree that they exist.{{sfn|Van Langendonck|1994}} \n#[[Complementizer phrase]] (CP). This contains a [[complementizer]], like ''that'' in English, as the head. In some cases the head is [[covert (linguistics)|covert]] (not overtly present). The complement can be considered to be a tense phrase.\n#[[Tense phrase]] (TP) and [[aspect phrase]] (AspP). These are phrases in which the head is an abstract [[syntactic category|category]] representing [[grammatical tense|tense]] or [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]; the complement is a verb phrase. In more traditional analysis the entire phrase (including any elements denoting tense or aspect) is considered to be simply a verb phrase.\n\nIn some cases, particularly with noun and adjective phrases, it is not always clear which dependents are to be classed as complements, and which as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s. Although in principle the head-directionality parameter concerns the order of heads and complements only, considerations of head-initiality and head-finality sometimes take account of the position of the head in the phrase as a whole, including adjuncts. The structure of the various types of phrase is analyzed below in relation to specific languages, with a focus on the ordering of head and complement. In some cases (such as English and Japanese) this ordering is found to be the same in practically all types of phrase, whereas in others (such as German and Gbe) the pattern is less consistent. Different theoretical explanations of these inconsistencies are discussed later in the article.\n\n==Particular languages==\n\n===English===\n[[English grammar|English]] is a strongly head-initial language. In a typical verb phrase, for example, the verb precedes its complements, as in the following example:{{sfn|Fukui|1994|p=4}}\n[[File:VP English.png|framed|right|English VP structure]]\n:''eat an apple''\n:[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>'''V'''</sub> '''eat'''] [<sub>DP</sub> an apple]]\n\nThe head of the phrase (the verb ''eat'') precedes its complement (the determiner phrase ''an apple''). Switching the order to \"[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> an apple] [<sub>V</sub> eat]]\" would be ungrammatical.\n\nNouns also tend to precede any complements, as in the following example, where the [[relative clause]] (or [[complementizer phrase]]) that follows the noun may be considered to be a complement:{{sfn|Smith|1964|p=6}}\n[[File:NP English.png|thumb|English NP structure]]\n:''He married a girl who is from Texas.''\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>'''N'''</sub> '''girl'''] [<sub>CP</sub> who is from Texas]]\n\nNouns do not necessarily begin their phrase; they may be preceded by [[attributive adjective]]s, but these are regarded as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s rather than complements. (For preceding [[determiner]]s, see below.) Adjectives themselves may be preceded by adjuncts, namely [[adverb]]s, as in ''extremely happy''.{{sfn|Sadler & Arnold|1994|pp=28\u201334}} However, when an adjective phrase contains a true complement, such as a prepositional phrase, the head adjective precedes it:{{sfn|Sadler & Arnold|1994|pp=28}}\n:''a person happy about her work''\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>'''A'''</sub> '''happy'''] [<sub>PP</sub> about her work]]\n\nEnglish adpositional phrases are also head-initial; that is, English has [[preposition]]s rather than postpositions:{{sfn|Gillion|1992|p=15}}\n[[File:PP English.png|framed|right|English PP structure]]\n:''a majority of eligible voters''\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>'''P'''</sub> '''of'''] [<sub>DP</sub> eligible voters]]\n\nOn the [[determiner phrase]] (DP) view, where a [[determiner]] is taken to be the head of its phrase (rather than the associated noun), English can be seen to be head-initial in this type of phrase too. In the following example{{sfn|Takahashi|2002|p=2}} the head is taken to be the determiner ''any'', and the complement is the noun (phrase) ''book'':\n\n[[File:DP English.png|framed|right|English DP structure]]\n:''any book''\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>'''D'''</sub> '''any'''] [<sub>NP</sub> book]]\n\nEnglish also has head-initial [[complementizer phrase]]s, as in this example{{sfn|Sells|1995|p=4}} where the complementizer ''that'' precedes its complement, the tense phrase ''Mary did not swim'':\n:''We saw that Mary did not swim''\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>'''C'''</sub> '''that'''] [<sub>TP</sub> Mary did not swim]]\n\nGrammatical words marking tense and aspect generally precede the semantic verb. This indicates that, if finite verb phrases are analyzed as [[tense phrase]]s or aspect phrases, these are again head-initial in English. In the example above, ''did'' is considered a ([[past tense|past]]) tense marker, and precedes its complement, the verb phrase ''not swim''. In the following, ''has'' is a ([[perfect aspect|perfect]]) aspect marker;{{sfn|Lin|2003|p=2}} again it appears before the verb (phrase) which is its complement.\n[[File:AsP English.png|thumb|right|English AspP Structure]]\n:''John has arrived''\n:[<sub>AspP</sub> [<sub>Asp</sub> '''has'''] [<sub>VP</sub> arrived]]\n\nThe following example shows a sequence of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement.{{sfn|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014}} In the [[complementizer phrase]] (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the [[tense phrase]] in (b), the [[grammatical tense|tense]]-marking element (T) precedes its verb phrase (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, ''the girl'', is a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], which does not need to be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the [[verb phrase]] in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the determiner phrase (DP) ''the book'' and the prepositional phrase (PP) ''on the table''. In (d), where ''a picture'' is analyzed as a determiner phrase, the determiner (D) ''a'' precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the [[preposition]] (P) ''on'' precedes its DP complement ''your desk''.\n:''You know that the girl will put a picture on your desk.''\n:a. CP: [<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>C</sub> '''''that''''' ]  [<sub>TP</sub> ''the girl will put a picture on your desk'' ] ]\n:b. TP: [<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>T</sub> '''''will''''' ]  [<sub>VP</sub> ''put a picture on your desk'' ] ]\n:c. VP: [<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>V</sub> '''''put''''' ]   [<sub>DP</sub> ''a picture'' ] [<sub>PP</sub> ''on your desk'' ] ]\n:d. DP: [<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>D</sub> '''''a''''' ]     [<sub>NP</sub> ''picture'' ] ]\n:e. PP: [<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>P</sub> '''''on''''' ]    [<sub>DP</sub> ''your desk'' ] ]\n\n===German===\n{{cleanup|section|reason=See talk page, section \"Mistakes...\"|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[German grammar|German]], while being predominantly head-initial, is less conclusively so than in the case of English. German also features certain head-final structures. For example, in a [[nonfinite verb|nonfinite]] verb phrase the verb is final. In a finite verb phrase (or tense/aspect phrase) the verb (tense/aspect) is initial, although it may move to final position in a [[subordinate clause]]. In the following example,{{sfn|Dopke|1998|p=6}}  the non-finite verb phrase ''es finden'' is head-final, whereas in the tensed main clause ''ich werde es finden'' (headed by the [[auxiliary verb]] ''werde'' indicating [[future tense]]), the finite auxiliary precedes its complement (as an instance of a [[verb-second]] construction; in the example below, this V2-position is called \"T\"). \n[[File:VP Head Final German.png|thumb|right|German VP structure]]\n:''Ich werde es finden''\n:I   will  it find\n:\"I will find it.\"\n:[<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> Ich] [<sub>T</sub> '''werde'''] [<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> es] [<sub>'''V'''</sub> '''finden''']]]\n\nNoun phrases containing complements are head-initial; in this example{{sfn|Berthold|2005|p=6}} the complement, the CP ''der den Befehl \u00fcberbrachte'', follows the head noun ''Boten''.\n:''Man beschimpfte den Boten,    der den Befehl  \u00fcberbrachte''\n:one insulted    the messenger who the command delivered\n:\"The messenger, who delivered the command, was insulted.\"\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>N</sub> '''Boten'''] [<sub>CP</sub> der den Befehl \u00fcberbrachte]]\n\nAdjective phrases may be head-final or head-initial. In the next example the adjective (''stolze'') follows its complement (''auf seine Kinder'').{{sfn|Hinterh\u00f6lzl|2010|p=4}}\n[[File:AP Final German.png|thumb|right|German head-final AP Structure]]\n:''der auf seine Kinder stolze Vater''\n:the of his children proud father\n:\"the father (who is) proud of his children\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>PP</sub> auf seine Kinder] [<sub>A</sub> '''stolze''']]\n\nHowever, when essentially the same adjective phrase is used [[predicative adjective|predicatively]] rather than attributively, it can also be head-initial:{{sfn|Hinterh\u00f6lzl|2010|p=5}}\n[[File:AP Initial German.png|thumb|right|German head-initial AP Structure]]\n:''weil er stolz auf seine Kinder ist''\n:since he proud of his children is\n:\"since he is proud of his children\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>A</sub> '''stolz'''] [<sub>PP</sub> auf seine Kinder]]\n\nMost adpositional phrases are head-initial (as German has mostly prepositions rather than postpositions), as in the following example, where ''auf'' comes before its complement ''den Tisch'':{{sfn|Van Riemsdijk|2007|p=3}}\n[[File:PP Initial German.png|thumb|right|German head-initial PP structure]]\n:''Peter legt das Buch auf den Tisch''\n:Peter puts the book on the.ACC table\n:\"Peter puts the book on the table.\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>P</sub> '''auf'''] [<sub>DP</sub> den Tisch]]\n\nGerman also has some [[postposition]]s, however (such as ''gegen\u00fcber'' \"opposite\"), and so adpositional phrases can also sometimes be head-final. Another example is provided by the analysis of the following sentence:{{sfn|Van Riemsdijk|2007|p=1}} \n:''Die Schnecke kroch das Dach hinauf''\n:the snail crept the roof up\n:\"The snail crept up the roof\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> das Dach] [<sub>P</sub> '''hinauf''']]\n\nLike in English, determiner phrases and complementizer phrases in German are head-initial. The next example is of a determiner phrase, headed by the article ''der'':{{sfn|Bianchi|1999|p=251}}\n[[File:CP German.png|thumb|right|German CP Structure]]\n:''der Mann''\n:the man\n:\"the man\"\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>D</sub> '''der'''] [<sub>NP</sub> Mann]]\n\nIn the following example, the complementizer ''dass'' precedes the tense phrase which serves as its complement:{{sfn|Kathol|2001|p=1}}\n:''dass Lisa eine Blume gepflanzt hat''\n:that Lisa a flower planted has\n:\"that Lisa planted a flower\"\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>C</sub> '''dass'''] [<sub>TP</sub> Lisa eine Blume gepflanzt hat]]\n\n===Japanese===\nJapanese is an example of a strongly head-final language. This can be seen in verb phrases and tense phrases: the verb (''tabe'' in the example) comes after its complement, while the tense marker (''ru'') comes after the whole verb phrase which is its complement.{{sfn|Fukui|1994|p=4}}\n[[File:VP Japanese.png|framed|right|Japanese VP structure]]\n:''ringo-o   tabe-ru''\n:apple-ACC eat-NONPAST\n:\"eat an apple\"\n:[<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> ringo-o] [<sub>V</sub> '''tabe''']] [<sub>T</sub> '''ru''']]\n\nNouns also typically come after any complements, as in the following example where the PP ''New York-de-no'' may be regarded as a complement:{{sfn|Naoki|1993|pp=15\u201316}}\n[[File:NP Japanese.png|thumb|right|Japanese NP structure]]\n:''John-no  kinoo-no      New York-de-no  koogi''\n:John-GEN yesterday-GEN New York-in-GEN lecture\n:\"John's lecture in New York yesterday\"\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>PP</sub> New York-de-no] [<sub>N</sub> '''koogi''']]\n\nAdjectives also follow any complements they may have. In this example the complement of quantity, ''ni-juu-meetoro'' (\"twenty meters\"), precedes the head adjective ''takai'' (\"tall\"):{{sfn|Watanabe|2011|pp=9\u201310}}\n:''Kono biru-wa      ni-juu-meetoru takai''\n:this building-TOPIC two-ten-meter  tall\n:\"This building is twenty meters taller.\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>Q</sub> ni-juu-meetoru] [<sub>A</sub> '''takai''']]\n\nJapanese uses postpositions rather than prepositions, so its adpositional phrases are again head-final:{{sfn|Vinka|2009|p=4}}\n[[File:PP Japanese.png|thumb|right|Japanese PP structure]]\n:''Boku-ga Takasu-mura-ni    sunde-iru''\n:I-NOM   Takasu-village-in live-PRES\n:\"I live in Takasu village.\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> Takasu-mura] [<sub>P</sub> '''ni''']]\n\nDeterminer phrases are head-final as well:{{sfn|Takahashi|2002|p=2}}\n[[File:DP Japanese.png|framed|right|Japanese DP structure]]\n:''dare mo''\n:person any\n:\"anyone\"\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> dare] [<sub>D</sub> '''mo''']]\n\nA complementizer (here ''to'', equivalent to English \"that\") comes after its complement (here a tense phrase meaning \"Mary did not swim\"), thus Japanese complementizer phrases are head-final:{{sfn|Sells|1995|p=4}} \n:''Mary-ga  oyog-ana-katta-to''\n:Mary-NOM swim-NEG-PAST-that\n:\"that Mary did not swim\"\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>TP</sub> Mary-ga oyog-ana-katta] [<sub>C</sub> '''to''']]\n\n===Chinese===\n[[Standard Chinese]] (whose syntax is typical of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] generally) features a mixture of head-final and head-initial structures. Noun phrases are head-final. Modifiers virtually always precede the noun they modify. For examples of this involving relative clauses, see {{Section link|Relative clause|Mandarin}}.\n\nIn the case of strict head/complement ordering, however, Chinese appears to be head-initial. Verbs normally precede their objects. Both prepositions and postpositions are reported, but the postpositions can be analyzed as a type of noun (the prepositions are often called [[coverb]]s). For more details and examples of the relevant structures, see [[Chinese grammar]]. For a head-direction analysis of Chinese aspect phrases, see the theoretical section below.\n\n===Gbe===\nIn [[Gbe languages|Gbe]], a mixture of head-initial and head-final structures is found. For example, a verb may appear after or before its complement, which means that both head-initial and head-final verb phrases occur.{{sfn|Aboh|2001|pp=1\u20132}} In the first example the verb for \"use\" appears after its complement:\n:''K\u0254\u0300j\u00f3 t\u00f3     \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301  z\u00e2n''\n:Kojo IMPERF oil DET use\n:\"Kojo is using the oil.\"\n:[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>DP</sub> \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301] [<sub>V</sub> '''z\u00e2n''']]\n\nIn the second example the verb precedes the complement:\n:''K\u0254\u0300j\u00f3 n\u0254\u0300  z\u00e1n      \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301''\n:Kojo HAB use-PERF oil DET\n:\"Kojo habitually used the oil/Kojo habitually uses the oil.\"\n:[<sub>VP</sub> [<sub>V</sub> '''z\u00e1n'''] [<sub>DP</sub> \u00e0m\u00ed l\u0254\u0301]]\n\nIt has been debated whether the first example is due to object [[syntactic movement|movement]] to the left side of the verb {{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=2}} or whether the lexical entry of the verb simply allows head-initial and head-final structures.{{sfn|Kinyalolo|1992|pp=1\u201316}}\n\nTense phrases and aspect phrases are head-initial since aspect markers (such as ''t\u00f3'' and ''n\u0254\u0300 '' above) and tense markers (such as the future marker ''n\u00e1'' in the following example, but that does not apply to tense markers shown by verb [[inflection]]) come before the verb phrase.{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=34}}\n:''d\u00e0w\u00e9 l\u0254\u0300   n\u00e1 x\u0254\u0300   k\u025b\u0300k\u025b\u0301''\n:man DET FUT buy bicycle\n:\"The man will buy a bicycle.\"\n:[<sub>TP</sub> [<sub>T</sub> '''n\u00e1'''] [<sub>VP</sub> x\u0254\u0300 k\u025b\u0300k\u025b\u0301]]\n\nGbe noun phrases are typically head-final, as in this example:{{sfn|Brousseau & Lumsden|1992|p=4}}\n[[File:NP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe NP structure]]\n:''K\u0254\u0300k\u00fa s\u00edn  \u0256\u00ecd\u00e8   l\u025b\u0300''\n:Koku-CASE sketch-PL\n:\"sketches of Koku\"\n:[<sub>NP</sub> [<sub>KP</sub> K\u0254\u0300k\u00fa s\u00edn] [<sub>N</sub> '''\u0256\u00ecd\u00e8''']]\n\nIn the following example of an adjective phrase, Gbe follows a head-initial pattern, as the head ''y\u00f9'' precedes the [[intensifier]] ''t\u00e0\u00f9\u00fa''.{{sfn|Aboh|2004}}\n[[File:AP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe AP structure]]\n:''\u00e0\u01d4n  y\u00f9 t\u00e0\u00f9\u00fa''\n:dog black-Int\n:\"really black dogs\"\n:[<sub>AP</sub> [<sub>A</sub> '''y\u00f9'''] [<sub>Int</sub> t\u00e0\u00f9\u00fa]]\n\nGbe adpositional phrases are head-initial, with prepositions preceding their complement:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=117}}\n:''K\u00f2fi     z\u00e9        kw\u025b\u0301      xl\u00e1n  \u00c0s\u00edb\u00e1\"\n:Kofi   take-PERF money    to Asiba\n:\"Kofi sent money to Asiba.\"\n:[<sub>PP</sub> [<sub>P</sub> '''xl\u00e1n'''] [<sub>DP</sub> \u00c0s\u00edb\u00e1]]\n\nDeterminer phrases, however, are head-final:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=100}}\n[[File:CP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe CP structure]]\n:''As\u00edb\u00e1   x\u0254\u0300        \u00e0v\u0254\u0300   \u00e0m\u00e0m\u00fa  m\u00e0t\u00e0n-m\u00e0t\u00e0n        \u0256\u00e9''\n:Asiba buy-PERF cloth   green    odd             DEF\n:\"Asiba bought a specific ugly green cloth\"\n:[<sub>DP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> \u00e0v\u0254\u0300 \u00e0m\u00e0m\u00fa m\u00e0t\u00e0n-m\u00e0t\u00e0n] [<sub>D</sub> '''\u0256\u00e9''']]\n\nComplementizer phrases are head-initial:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=348}} \n:''\u0256\u00e9   D\u00f2s\u00e0    gb\u00e1      xw\u00e9   \u0254\u0300        \u0254\u0300''\n:that Dosa build-PERF house DEF DET\n:\"that Dosa built the house\"\n:[<sub>CP</sub> [<sub>C</sub> '''\u0256\u00e9'''] [<sub>TP</sub> D\u00f2s\u00e0 gb xw\u00e9 \u0254\u0300 \u0254\u0300]]\n\n==Theoretical views==\nThe idea that syntactic structures reduce to binary relations was introduced by [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] within the framework of [[dependency grammar|dependency theory]], which was developed during the 1960s. Tesni\u00e8re distinguished two structures that differ in the placement of the structurally governing element ([[head (grammar)|head]]):{{sfn|Graffi|2001|pp=197\u2013198}} '''centripetal structures''', in which heads precede their [[dependent (grammar)|dependent]]s, and '''centrifugal structures''', in which heads follow their dependents. Dependents here may include [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s, [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]], and [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]]s.\n\n[[Joseph Greenberg]], who worked in the field of [[language typology]], put forward an implicational theory of [[word order]], whereby:{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=2}}\n*If a language has VO (verb-before-object) ordering, then it will also have [[preposition]]s (rather than postpositions), and genitives and adjectives will be placed after the noun they modify.\n*If a language has OV ordering, then it will also have postpositions, and genitives and adjectives will be placed before the noun they modify.\nThe first set of properties make heads come at the start of their phrases, while the second set make heads come at the end. However, it has been claimed that many languages (such as [[Basque language|Basque]]) do not fulfill the above conditions, and that Greenberg's theory fails to predict the exceptions.{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=5}}\n\n[[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[Principles and Parameters theory]] in the 1980s{{sfn|Chomsky|1981}} introduced the idea that a small number of innate principles are common to every human language (e.g. phrases are oriented around heads), and that these general principles are subject to parametric variation (e.g. the order of heads and other phrasal components may differ). In this theory, the dependency relation between heads, complements, specifiers, and adjuncts is regulated by [[X-bar theory]], proposed by Jackendoff{{sfn|Jackendoff|1977}} in the 1970s. The complement is sister to the head, and they can be ordered in one of two ways. A head-complement order is called a '''head-initial structure''', while a complement-head order is called a '''head-final structure'''. These are special cases of Tesni\u00e8re's centripetal and centrifugal structures, since here only complements are considered, whereas Tesni\u00e8re considered all types of dependents.\n\nIn the principles and parameters theory, a head-directionality parameter is proposed as a way of [[linguistic typology|classifying languages]]. A language which has head-initial structures is considered to be a '''head-initial language''', and one which has head-final structures is considered to be a '''head-final language'''. It is found, however, that very few, if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other. Linguists have come up with a number of theories to explain the inconsistencies, sometimes positing a more consistent [[underlying representation|underlying]] order, with the phenomenon of phrasal [[syntactic movement|movement]] being used to explain the surface deviations.\n\nAccording to the [[Antisymmetry]] theory proposed by [[Richard Kayne]], there is no head-directionality parameter as such: it is claimed that at an underlying level, all languages are head-initial. In fact, it is argued that all languages have the underlying order Specifier-Head-Complement. Deviations from this order are accounted for by different [[syntactic movement]]s applied by languages. Kayne argues that a theory that allows both directionalities would imply an absence of [[asymmetry|asymmetries]] between languages, whereas in fact languages fail to be symmetrical in many respects. Kayne argues using the concept of a probe-goal search (based on the ideas of the [[Minimalist program]]), whereby a [[Head (linguistics)|head]] acts as a probe and looks for a goal, namely its [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]. Kayne proposes that the direction of the probe-goal search must share the direction of language [[parsing]] and production.{{sfn|Kayne|2011|p=12}} Parsing and production proceed in a left-to-right direction: the beginning of sentence is heard or spoken first, and the end of the sentence is heard or spoken last. This implies (according to the theory) an ordering whereby probe comes before goal, i.e. head precedes complement.\n\nSome linguists have rejected the conclusions of the Antisymmetry approach. Some have pointed out that in predominantly head-final languages such as [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] and [[Basque grammar|Basque]], the change from an underlying head-initial form to a largely head-final surface form would involve complex and massive leftward movement, which is not in accordance with the ideal of grammatical simplicity.{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=5}} Some take a \"surface true\" viewpoint: that analysis of head direction must take place at the level of [[surface form|surface derivations]], or even the [[Phonetic Form]] (PF), i.e. the order in which sentences are pronounced in natural speech. This rejects the idea of an underlying ordering which is then subject to movement, as posited in Antisymmetry and in certain other approaches. It has been argued that a head parameter must only reside at PF, as it is unmaintainable in its original form as a structural parameter.{{sfn|Richards|2008|p=283}}\n\nSome linguists have provided evidence which may be taken to support Kayne's scheme, such as Lin,{{sfn|Lin|2006}} who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the [[Chinese grammar#Particles|sentence-final particle]] ''le''. Certain restrictions on movement from within verb phrases preceding such a particle are found (if various other assumptions from the literature are accepted) to be consistent with the idea that the verb phrase has moved from its underlying position after its head (the particle ''le'' here being taken as the head of an [[aspect phrase]]). However, Takita (2009) observes that similar restrictions do not apply in Japanese, in spite of its surface head-final character, concluding that if Lin's assumptions are correct, then Japanese must be considered to be a true head-final language, contrary to the main tenet of Antisymmetry.{{sfn|Takita|2009|pp=59}} More details about these arguments can be found in the [[Antisymmetry]] article.\n\n==Statistical classifications==\n\nSome scholars, such as Tesni\u00e8re, argue that there are no absolute head-initial or head-final languages. According to this approach, it is true that some languages have more head-initial or head-final elements than other languages do, but almost any language contains both head-initial and head-final elements.  Therefore, rather than being classifiable into fixed categories, languages can be arranged on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] with head-initial and head-final as the extremes, based on the frequency distribution of their [[Dependency grammar|dependency]] directions. This view was supported in a study by Haitao Liu (2010), who investigated 20 languages using a dependency [[treebank]]-based method.{{sfn|Liu|2010|pp=1567\u20131578}} For instance, Japanese is close to the head-final end of the continuum, while English and German, which have mixed head-initial and head-final dependencies, are plotted in relatively intermediate positions on the continuum.\n\nPolinsky (2012) identified the following five head-directionality sub-types:\n* Rigid head-final languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]];\n* Non-rigid head-final languages, including [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Tsez language|Tsez]] and [[Avar language|Avar]];\n* Clearly head-initial languages, including [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Tongan language|Tongan]] and most [[Mayan languages]];\n* \"SVO/head-initial\" languages, including [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Yucatec Mayan]];\n* \"SVO sundry\", including [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[Romance languages]] and [[Bantu languages]].\n\nShe identified a strong correlation between the head-directionality type of a language and the ratio of verbs to nouns in the lexical inventory. Languages with a scarcity of simple verbs tend to be rigidly head-final, as in the case of Japanese, whereas verb-rich languages tend to be head-initial languages.{{sfn|Polinsky|2012|pp=348-359}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Dependent-marking language]]\n*[[Double-marking language]]\n*[[Government (linguistics)]]\n*[[Government and binding theory]]\n*[[Head (linguistics)]]\n*[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Head-marking language]]\n*[[Minimalist grammar]]\n*[[Transformational grammar]]\n*[[Word order]]\n*[[Zero-marking language]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite journal|ref = harv|last1=Aboh|first1=Enoch|title=Object shift and verb movement in Gbe|journal=Generative Grammar in Geneva|date=2001|volume=2|pages=1\u201313|url=http://www.unige.ch/lettres/linge/syntaxe/journal/2/1.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}\n* {{cite book|ref = harv|last1=Aboh|first1=Enoch|title=The morphosyntax of complement-head sequences: Clause structure and word order patterns in kwa|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{cite book|ref = harv|last1=Bianchi|first1=Valentina|title=Consequences of antisymmetry: Headed relative clauses.|date=1999|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}\n* {{cite book|ref = harv|last1=Broekhuis|first1=H|title=Syntax of Dutch: Adjectives and Adjective Phrases|date=2013|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam}}\n*Brousseau, Anne-Marie & Lumsden, John S.
