In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the [[liver]], although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the [[common hepatic duct]] and releases it via the [[common bile duct]] into the [[duodenum]], where the bile helps in the digestion of [[fat]]s.\n\nThe gallbladder can be affected by [[gallstone]]s, formed by material that cannot be dissolved \u2013 usually [[cholesterol]] or [[bilirubin]], a product of [[haemoglobin]] breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a [[cholecystectomy]] ('''cholecyst''' means gallbladder). [[Cholecystitis]], inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe gallbladder is a hollow [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the [[liver]], that is grey-blue in life.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=1187-81}} In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately {{convert|7|to|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|4|cm|in}} in diameter when fully distended.<ref name=\"meilstrup\">{{cite book |author=Jon W.

Produced by the liver, bile flows through small vessels into the larger [[hepatic duct]]s and ultimately through the [[cystic duct]] (parts of the [[biliary tree]]) into the gallbladder, where it is stored. At any one time, {{convert|30|to|60|ml|usoz}} of bile is stored within the gallbladder.<ref name=PHYSIOLOGY2005 />\n\nWhen food containing fat enters the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]], it stimulates the [[secretion]] of [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK) from [[I cell]]s of the duodenum and jejunum. In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the [[common bile duct]], eventually draining into the [[duodenum]]. The bile [[Emulsion|emulsifies]] fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the [[liver]], although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the [[common hepatic duct]] and releases it via the [[common bile duct]] into the [[duodenum]], where the bile helps in the digestion of [[fat]]s.\n\nThe gallbladder can be affected by [[gallstone]]s, formed by material that cannot be dissolved \u2013 usually [[cholesterol]] or [[bilirubin]], a product of [[haemoglobin]] breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a [[cholecystectomy]] ('''cholecyst''' means gallbladder). [[Cholecystitis]], inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe gallbladder is a hollow [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the [[liver]], that is grey-blue in life.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=1187-81}} In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately {{convert|7|to|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|4|cm|in}} in diameter when fully distended.<ref name=\"meilstrup\">{{cite book |author=Jon W.

In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the [[common bile duct]], eventually draining into the [[duodenum]]. The bile [[Emulsion|emulsifies]] fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and [[bile salt]]s, and also acts as a means of eliminating [[bilirubin]], a product of [[hemoglobin]] metabolism, from the body.<ref name=PHYSIOLOGY2005 />\n\nThe bile that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder.

It is most commonly an [[iatrogenic]] complication of [[cholecystectomy]] \u2014 surgical removal of [[gall bladder]], but can also be caused by other operations or by [[major trauma]]. The risk of biliary injury is more during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than during open cholecystectomy. Biliary injury may lead to several complications and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. Ideally biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in [[endoscopy]], [[radiology]] and surgery.<ref>{{citation | author=VK Kapoor | title=Bile duct injury repair: when? what? who? | journal=Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=476\u2013479 | pmid=17909716 | doi=10.1007/s00534-007-1220-y}}</ref>\n\nBiloma is collection of [[bile]] within the [[abdominal cavity]]. It happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for removing the gallbladder ([[laparoscopic cholecystectomy]]), with an incidence of 0.3\u20132%. Other causes are biliary surgery, [[liver biopsy]], [[abdominal trauma]], and, rarely, spontaneous perforation.<ref>{{citation | author=Norton J. Greenberger|display-authors=et al | chapter=Endoscopic Management of Acute Biliary & Pancreatic Conditions | title=Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endoscopy | series=[[Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment]] | year=2009 | pages=355\u2013356}}</ref>\n\n===Cancer===\n{{main|Gallbladder carcinoma}}\nCancer of the gallbladder is uncommon and mostly occurs in later life. When cancer occurs, it is mostly of the glands lining the surface of the gallbladder ([[adenocarcinoma]]).<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /> Gallstones are thought to be linked to the formation of cancer, and other risk factors include large (>1&nbsp;cm) [[gallbladder polyp]]s and having a highly calcified [[porcelain gallbladder|\"porcelain\" gallbladder]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\nCancer of the gallbladder can cause attacks of biliary pain, yellowing of the skin ([[jaundice]]), and weight loss. A large gallbladder may be able to be felt in the abdomen. [[Liver function test]]s may be elevated, particularly involving [[Gamma-glutamyltransferase|GGT]] and [[Alkaline phosphatase|ALP]], with ultrasound and CT scans being considered [[medical imaging]] investigations of choice.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /> Cancer of the gallbladder is managed by removing the gallbladder, however {{as of|2010}} the prognosis remains poor.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\nCancer of the gallbladder may also be found incidentally after surgical removal of the gallbladder, with 1-3% of cancers identified in this way. [[Gallbladder polyp]]s are mostly benign growths or lesions resembling growths that form in the gallbladder wall<ref>{{cite web|title=Gallbladder Polyps|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gallbladder-polyps/AN01044|website=MayoClinic|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> and are only associated with cancer when they are larger in size (>1&nbsp;cm).<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /> Cholesterol polyps, often associated with [[Cholesterolosis of the gallbladder|cholesterolosis]] (\"strawberry gallbladder\", a change in the gallbladder wall due to excess [[cholesterol]]<ref>[http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?strawberry+gallbladder Strawberry gallbladder] \u2013 cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk.</ref>), often cause no symptoms and are thus often detected in this way.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\n===Tests===\n[[File:Ultrasonography of sludge and gallstones, annotated.jpg|thumb|[[Abdominal ultrasonography]] showing [[biliary sludge]] and [[gallstone]]s.]]\nTests used to investigate for gallbladder disease include [[blood tests]] and [[medical imaging]]. A [[full blood count]] may reveal an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection. Tests such as [[bilirubin]] and [[liver function tests]] may reveal if there is inflammation linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder, and whether this is associated with inflammation of the liver, and a [[lipase]] or [[amylase]] may be elevated if there is [[pancreatitis]]. Bilirubin may rise when there is obstruction of the flow of bile. A [[CA 19-9]] level may be taken to investigate for cholangiocarcinoma.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\n[[Ultrasound]] is often the first [[medical imaging]] test performed when gallbladder disease such as gallstones are suspected.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /> An [[abdominal X-ray]] or [[CT scan]] is another form of imaging that may be used to examine the gallbladder and surrounding organs.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /> Other imaging options include MRCP ([[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]]), [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] and percutaneous or intraoperative [[cholangiography]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /> A [[cholescintigraphy]] scan is a [[nuclear imaging]] procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder.<ref>{{cite web|title=HIDA scan - Overview|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hida-scan/home/ovc-20200578|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=18 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Society and culture ==\nTo have 'gall' is associated with bold behaviour, whereas to have 'bile' is associated with bitterness.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.
