It also featured a wide array of food choices, including Chuck'E'Cheese, Hardees', and Petite Park. The mall also had an amusement centre occupying Levels 3 and 4 (Funland) and a playground at Level 7, which was the largest mall playground in Singapore at that time.\n\nIn 2000, the property was sold to Asia Pacific Insurance Company, and subsequently Lendlease was appointed to manage the mall.\n\nThe mall commenced its first makeover in March 2002 and was completed in two phases. The first phase included a new tenant mix, to reflect the positioning of the mall. This included anchor tenant, [[Giant Hypermarket|Giant]], occupying nearly half of the third floor. The mall's second phase was completed in November 2003, with a brand-new and expanded [[food court]] at the Basement floor and an [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining area on the first floor. It also included the completion of the 'Waterfall' leisure and dining precinct with one of the country's tallest glass waterfall, a water play area, six food and beverage outdoor kiosks and a restaurant. The mall was fully renovated in November 2003.\n\nFurther facelifts were done to mall's exterior featuring an expanded [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining to the first floor. in 2011, with the removal of the 'Waterfall' leisure feature and repositioning of the entrance area. Completed in end 2012, the new [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining area houses around 10 new tenants to the expansion, which includes Din Tai Fung, Papparich and Twelve Cupcakes.\n\nIn 2015, another round of renovations were made to keep the mall updated. Best Denki was relocated to Level 3, together with six rows of retail shops taking a part of Giant Hypermarket's space.
