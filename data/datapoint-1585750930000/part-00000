{"title_page": "Nilgiri Ghat Roads", "text_new": "Many '''[[Ghat Roads]]''' can be found in the [[Nilgiris District]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Southern India]]. Nearly all of the district is located in the [[Nilgiri Hills]], part of the [[Western Ghats]] mountains. This area borders the states of [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. The hills consequently can be reached by road from three states. Most of these Ghat Roads go through heavily forested mountains and contain a number of sharp hair-pin bends.\n\n== Route Descriptions ==\nThere are five main Ghat Roads leading into the Nilgiris:<ref name=\"sdfjklqace\">{{cite web | url= http://www.investingintamilnadu.com/tamilnadu/doc/policy/Highways_and_Minor_Ports.pdf | title= Details of Government Roads in Tamil Nadu | author= Investingintamilnadu, Tamil Nadu Industrial Guidance & Export Promotion Bureau, Industries Department (Government of Tamil Nadu)  | accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Kotagiri Ghat (State Highway 15) ===\nRoute: [[Erode]]-[[Gobichettipalayam]]-[[Sathyamangalam]]-[[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]-[[Aravenu]]-[[Kotagiri]]-[[Ooty]]\n\nThe Kotagiri Ghat is the oldest known route into the Nilgiris. It approximately follows the route taken by [[John Sullivan (British governor)|John Sullivan]] on his discovery trips in 1819. The distance between Mettupalayam and Kotagiri on this road is 33&nbsp;km and it has only 4 hair pin bends. This road is part of [[State Highway 15 (Tamil Nadu)|State Highway 15]]. It is slightly less travelled as it is a slightly longer route from Mettupalayam to Ooty than the route via [[Coonoor]], though as of 2012 the road condition is superior to the Coonoor Ghat road. It is also statistically less vulnerable to landslips. It is possible to divert from this route to Coonoor. There is a link from Aravenu to [[Bandishola]].\n\nTravellers reach [[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]] from [[Coimbatore]] and from [[Chennai]] via [[Erode]] and [[Gobichettipalayam]].\n\n=== Coonoor Ghat (National Highway 67) ===\nRoute: [[Coimbatore]]-[[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]-Kallar-[[Burliar]]-Coonoor-[[Ooty]]-[[Pykara]]\n\nThis is also known as the '''Kallar Ghat''', as it follows the valley of the Kallar and Coonoor rivers. It is by far the most traveled of all the Ghat Roads as it is the main access from the home state of Tamil Nadu. It has 14 numbered Hairpin bends and was recently (c.2003) taken over to be owned and maintained by the [[National Highways Authority of India]] and is now part of '''[[National Highway 181 (India)|National Highway 181]]'''. Previously a toll had to be paid for vehicles entering [[The Nilgiris District|the Nilgiris district]] at the village of Burliar, which also provides a rest stop on the route.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe road was shut in 2010 due to [[landslides]] caused by heavy rains in the region.<ref name=\"trafficresume\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/article80877.ece|title=Traffic resumes on Mettupalayam-Coonoor Road|date=2010-01-15|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=Coimbatore}}</ref> Subsequently, the [[National Highways Authority of India]] had the road re-laid which got eroded, again due to rains.<ref name=\"gapinghole\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/chennai/28250762_1_nhai-repair-culverts|title=Rs 6 crore down the drain, Ooty highways is a gaping hole now|last=Thiagarajan|first=Shantha |date=2010-10-20|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=Chennai}}</ref> In 2012, the [[Highways of Tamil Nadu|Highways Department]] decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the NHAI, under Section 133 of Criminal Penal Code, dealing with acts endangering human life, due to non maintenance of the road.<ref name=\"criminalnhai\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article3249391.ece|title=Criminal proceedings likely against NHAI|last=D.|first=Radhakrishnan|date=2012-03-27|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=Udhagamandalam}}</ref>\n\n=== Gudalur Ghat   (National Highway 212 and 67) ===\nRoute: [[Gundlupet]]-[[Bandipur]]-[[Mudumalai National Park|Mudumalai]]-[[Gudalur (Nilgiris district)|Gudalur]]-Ooty\n\nThis is also simply known as the Mysore Ghat or Mysore Road. It is the main access route from Karnataka and Kerala. Travellers from Karnataka reach Gundlupet via the [[Mysore]]-Gundlupet National Highway 212 and travellers from Kerala reach Gudalur via the continuation of National Highway 212 from [[Kozhikode]]-[[Sultan Bathery]].\n\nOne traveller commented about this route: '''\"The road from Mysore is arguably the most scenic with a long stretch that runs through the Mudumalai National Park, and if travelling in the early morning or late evening, you will definitely spot wildlife feeding along the road, even the odd carnivore. There are majestic stands of Eucalyptus amidst well tended tea estates as you near Gudalur, and then you drive past the [[Pykara|Pykara Dam]] and [[Pykara|Pykara falls]]\"'''.\n\nAs with the Coonoor Ghat, from 2003-2006 this route was in a terrible state of repair. This route towards Gudalur from Ooty is the continuation of the same \"National Highway\" NH67 which makes up the Coonoor Ghat. National Highway 67 terminates in Gudulur where it joins National Highway 212 towards Gundlupet.\n\n=== Sigur Ghat (State Highway 67) ===\nRoute: [[Mudumalai National Park|Mudumalai]]-Kalhatti-Ooty\n\nThis is also known as Kalhatti Ghat (or simply 'Steep Ghat'). There is a short-cut branch off the Gudalur ghat at Theppakadu in Mudumalai. This route saves approx. 30&nbsp;km on the standard Gudalur route, though it is by far the steeper route and is generally limited to short wheel-base vehicles. It has 36 hairpin bends and is closed overnight.\n\n=== Manjur Ghat ===\nRoute: [[Karamadai]](Coimbatore)-Athikadavu-Mulli-Geddai-Manjoor-Kundha Dam-Yedakadu-Mount Lawrence ([[Avalanji Road]])-Emerald Cross Road-Muthurai Palada-Fern Hill-[[Ooty]]\n\nThis is a smaller ghat for local Coimbatore city traffic towards Ooty, and is used as a backup road on the rare occasions that both the Coonoor Ghat and the Kotagiri Ghat are closed. The road is narrow with 48 hairpin bends below Manjoor. At Geddai, near the bottom of the ghat at {{convert|1885|ft|m}}  there are two hydroelectric power stations [http://www.nilgiris.com/manjurdam.htm]. From Manjoor, at the top of the ghat, the distance is equidistant to either Ooty or Coonoor via other district roads. ODR.<ref>http://theindia.info/Blog/Ooty-by-Manjoor-Most-Beautiful-Road-to-Ooty-from-Coimbatore/ Ooty by Manjoor</ref>\n\n== Conditions ==\nUntil recently, all access roads to the Nilgiri hills were toll roads in order to facilitate the high maintenance costs. Roads are now in much better condition that a few years ago. However, it is not uncommon for a route to be closed for several days or even weeks due to [[Landslide|landslip]]s. If so traffic is usually diverted onto one of the other ghats. The Nilgiris have been totally cut off on all routes on rare occasions. As the supply infrastructure depends on these routes, any road activity (such as a closure) is reflected in the prices. During the main tourist season, a one-way system is implemented between the first two ghat roads mentioned.  Uphill traffic goes from Coimbatore to Ooty via Coonoor, whereas downhill traffic goes from Ooty to Coimbatore via Kotagiri.\n\n== References ==\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9WalzFldU Kalhatti Ghat, Ooty-Mudumalai-Mysore Road]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Indian Highways Network}}\n\n[[Category:State highways in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Scenic roads in India]]\n[[Category:Transport in Ooty]]\n", "text_old": "Many '''[[Ghat Roads]]''' can be found in the [[Nilgiris District]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Southern India]].
