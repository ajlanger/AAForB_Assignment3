The weekend saw a massive crash for [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] driver [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] in the third free practice session, after he lost control of his car at turn 13, hit a wall, and went into the Tecpro barriers. He was declared fit to start the race. [[Nico Rosberg]] took pole position but he was forced to retire in the early stages due to a faulty throttle. His teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] took the win, ahead of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Sebastian Vettel]], and [[Force India]]'s [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]], who had initially lost third place on the final lap, but retook it after [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Valtteri Bottas]] both collided while battling each other for third, with Bottas retiring on the spot and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen receiving a 30-second post race penalty for the collision. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] also secured their second consecutive constructor's championship, having done so at the previous year's event.\n\nThe [[2016 Russian Grand Prix|2016 event]] was held on 1 May 2016, moved forward to the fourth round of the calendar, unlike the previous two events. The race saw a big crash at the start at turn 2 that saw [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]], [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]], and [[Rio Haryanto]] all eliminated, while [[Sebastian Vettel]] was hit in the back by [[Daniil Kvyat]] going into turn 2, then he was hit again at turn 3, causing him to spin out and crash out of the race. On the Thursday after the event, [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] announced that they demoted Kvyat back to [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] for the rest of the season, switching places with 18-year-old Dutchman [[Max Verstappen]]. [[Nico Rosberg]] was the winner with [[Lewis Hamilton]] making it a one-two finish for Mercedes.\n\nThe [[2017 Russian Grand Prix|2017 event]] was held on 30 April 2017, and saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] secure his first career win in Formula One, ahead of the Ferrari pair of [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikkonen]]. Vettel and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen locked out the front row but both were passed by Bottas on the run to turn 2. The race saw [[Fernando Alonso]] unable to start due to a problem with his power unit and [[Romain Grosjean]] and [[Jolyon Palmer]] eliminated in a crash that saw the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] driver launch the [[Haas F1 Team|Haas]] driver into the air and into the barrier. Both drivers escaped unhurt. Bottas took the win by just 0.7 seconds from Vettel in the end, with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen setting the fastest lap.\n\nThe [[2018 Russian Grand Prix|2018 race]] was held on 30 September 2018, moved back from its April slot to fill a vacancy left by the [[Malaysian Grand Prix]], which was discontinued at the end of 2017. The event saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] take pole position one year after securing his first ever victory at the circuit.\nThe race was notable for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] ordering Bottas to let teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] to overtake for second place at turn 13 on lap 26. Hamilton himself took his third win at the circuit, with Bottas second ahead of [[Sebastian Vettel]]. The result sparked discussions about the future of team orders in the sport, with some{{Who|date=December 2019}} even calling for an outright ban on the practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn the [[2019 Russian Grand Prix]], [[Charles Leclerc]] was on pole ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, but Vettel jumped the both of them going into Turn 2, and led the race until lap 26, when he suffered a MGU-K failure. A lap later, [[George Russell (racing driver)|George Russell]] crashed into the barriers at Turn 9, which was an apparent wheel nut failure, as stated by the Williams team,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wheel-nut-retainer-caused-russell-retirement-in-sochi-say-williams.3IB9jqVwUl4Ek8aJUqOW8X.html|title=Russian Grand Prix 2019: Wheel nut retainer caused Russell retirement in Sochi, say Williams &#124; Formula 1\u00ae|website=www.formula1.com}}</ref> which prompted [[Robert Kubica]] to retire in order for the team to conserve parts.

The weekend saw a massive crash for [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] driver [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] in the third free practice session, after he lost control of his car at turn 13, hit a wall, and went into the Tecpro barriers. He was declared fit to start the race. [[Nico Rosberg]] took pole position but he was forced to retire in the early stages due to a faulty throttle. His teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] took the win, ahead of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Sebastian Vettel]], and [[Force India]]'s [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]], who had initially lost third place on the final lap, but retook it after [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Valtteri Bottas]] both collided while battling each other for third, with Bottas retiring on the spot and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen receiving a 30-second post race penalty for the collision. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] also secured their second consecutive constructor's championship, having done so at the previous year's event.\n\nThe [[2016 Russian Grand Prix|2016 event]] was held on 1 May 2016, moved forward to the fourth round of the calendar, unlike the previous two events. The race saw a big crash at the start at turn 2 that saw [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]], [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]], and [[Rio Haryanto]] all eliminated, while [[Sebastian Vettel]] was hit in the back by [[Daniil Kvyat]] going into turn 2, then he was hit again at turn 3, causing him to spin out and crash out of the race. On the Thursday after the event, [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] announced that they demoted Kvyat back to [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] for the rest of the season, switching places with 18-year-old Dutchman [[Max Verstappen]]. [[Nico Rosberg]] was the winner with [[Lewis Hamilton]] making it a one-two finish for Mercedes.\n\nThe [[2017 Russian Grand Prix|2017 event]] was held on 30 April 2017, and saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] secure his first career win in Formula One, ahead of the Ferrari pair of [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikkonen]]. Vettel and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen locked out the front row but both were passed by Bottas on the run to turn 2. The race saw [[Fernando Alonso]] unable to start due to a problem with his power unit and [[Romain Grosjean]] and [[Jolyon Palmer]] eliminated in a crash that saw the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] driver launch the [[Haas F1 Team|Haas]] driver into the air and into the barrier. Both drivers escaped unhurt. Bottas took the win by just 0.7 seconds from Vettel in the end, with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen setting the fastest lap.\n\nThe [[2018 Russian Grand Prix|2018 race]] was held on 30 September 2018, moved back from its April slot to fill a vacancy left by the [[Malaysian Grand Prix]], which was discontinued at the end of 2017. The event saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] take pole position one year after securing his first ever victory at the circuit.\nThe race was notable for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] ordering Bottas to let teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] to overtake for second place at turn 13 on lap 26. Hamilton himself took his third win at the circuit, with Bottas second ahead of [[Sebastian Vettel]]. The result sparked discussions about the future of team orders in the sport, with some{{Who|date=December 2019}} even calling for an outright ban on the practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn the [[2019 Russian Grand Prix]], [[Charles Leclerc]] was on pole ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, but Vettel jumped the both of them going into Turn 2, and led the race until lap 26, when he suffered a MGU-K failure. A lap later, [[George Russell]] crashed into the barriers at Turn 9, which was an apparent wheel nut failure, as stated by the Williams team,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wheel-nut-retainer-caused-russell-retirement-in-sochi-say-williams.3IB9jqVwUl4Ek8aJUqOW8X.html|title=Russian Grand Prix 2019: Wheel nut retainer caused Russell retirement in Sochi, say Williams &#124; Formula 1\u00ae|website=www.formula1.com}}</ref> which prompted [[Robert Kubica]] to retire in order for the team to conserve parts.
