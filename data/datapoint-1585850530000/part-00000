Due to the international [[Interwar period#Great Depression|political climate]] at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as [[class struggle]], a [[war of religion]], a struggle between [[dictatorship]] and [[Republicanism|republican democracy]], between [[revolution]] and [[counterrevolution]], and between [[fascism]] and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Juli\u00e1 |first = Santos |author-link = Santos Juli\u00e1 |title = Un siglo de Espa\u00f1a.

The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] by [[communist]] and [[socialist]] parties, under the leadership of [[centre-left]] President [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=43}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=84}} The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups, including [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|CEDA]], monarchists, including both the opposing [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] and the religious conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]], and the [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|FE de las JONS]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] political party.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}} After the deaths of Sanjurjo, [[Emilio Mola]] and [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n\nThe coup was supported by military units in the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], [[Pamplona]], [[Burgos]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Valladolid]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and [[Seville]]. However, rebelling units in some important cities\u2014such as [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]], and [[M\u00e1laga]]\u2014did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the Republican side received support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]]. Other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[United States]], continued to recognise the Republican government, but followed an official policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]]. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican [[International Brigades]], which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n\nThe Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of [[Catalonia]] was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the recognition of the Francoist regime by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939, and internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in March 1939, Franco entered the capital and declared victory on 1 April 1939. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled to refugee camps in [[southern France]].<ref name=\"historytoday.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/refugees-and-spanish-civil-war |title = Refugees and the Spanish Civil War &#124; History Today}}</ref><ref name=\"historytoday.com\"/> Those associated with the losing Republicans who stayed were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. Franco established a dictatorship in which all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}}\n\nThe war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and for the many atrocities that occurred, on both sides. Organised [[purge]]s occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces so they could consolidate their future regime.<ref>Beevor (2006). p. 88.</ref> Mass executions on a lesser scale also took place in areas controlled by the Republicans,<ref>Beevor (2006). pp.&nbsp;86\u201387.</ref> with the participation of local authorities varying from location to location.<ref>Beevor (2006). pp.&nbsp;260\u2013271.</ref><ref>Julius Ruiz. ''El Terror Rojo'' (2011). pp.&nbsp;200\u2013211.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Background of the Spanish Civil War}}\nThe 19th century was a turbulent time for Spain. Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms. Some liberals, in a tradition that started with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], sought to limit the power of the [[monarchy of Spain]] and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 were overturned when [[King Ferdinand VII]] dissolved the Constitution and ended the [[Trienio Liberal]] government.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' as well as all the important government positions.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=19}}\n\nIn 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of [[Queen Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by [[Joan Prim|General Joan Prim]]) concerned with the ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;13.</ref><ref>Preston (2006). p.&nbsp;21.</ref> After the [[Restoration (Spain)|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874,<ref>Preston (2006). p. 22.</ref> [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] emerged in opposition to the monarchy.<ref>Preston (2006). p. 24.</ref><ref>Fraser (1979). pp.&nbsp;38\u201339.</ref> [[Alejandro Lerroux]], Spanish politician and leader of the [[Radical Republican Party]], helped bring [[republicanism]] to the fore in [[Catalonia]], where poverty was particularly acute.<ref>Preston (2006). pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Growing resentment of [[conscription]] and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1909.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfonso XIIIdeEspa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|On 12 April 1931, the Republicans won the elections and the [[Spanish Second Republic]] was proclaimed two days later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] resigned and went into exile.]]\n[[Spain]] was neutral in [[World War I]]. Following the war, wide swathes of Spanish society, including the armed forces, united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful.<ref>Preston (2006). pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Popular perception of communism as a major threat significantly increased during this period.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=15}} In 1923, a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] brought [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to power; as a result, Spain transitioned to government by military dictatorship.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Support for the Rivera regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. He was replaced by General [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]], who was in turn himself replaced by [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as|Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as]]; both men continued a policy of rule by decree. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities. Consequently, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] gave in to popular pressure for the establishment of a republic in 1931 and called municipal elections for 12 April of that year. The socialist and liberal republicans won almost all the provincial capitals, and following the resignation of Aznar's government, King Alfonso XIII fled the country.<ref>Beevor (2006) pp.&nbsp;20\u201322.</ref> At this time, the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed. It remained in power until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=20}}\n\nThe revolutionary committee headed by [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] became the provisional government, with Alcal\u00e1-Zamora as [[President (government title)|president]] and [[head of state]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=23}} The republic had broad support from all segments of society.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=38\u201339}} In May, an incident where a taxi driver was attacked outside a monarchist club sparked anti-clerical violence throughout [[Madrid]] and south-west [[Spain]]. The government's slow response disillusioned the right and reinforced their view that the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] was determined to persecute the church. In June and July the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], known as the CNT, called several [[Strike action|strikes]], which led to a violent incident between CNT members and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and a brutal crackdown by the Civil Guard and the [[Spanish Army|army]] against the CNT in [[Seville]]. This led many workers to believe the Spanish Second Republic was just as oppressive as the monarchy, and the CNT announced its intention of overthrowing it via [[revolution]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=26}} Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and [[Socialism|Socialists]].<ref>Preston (2006). p. 50.</ref> With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the government tried to assist rural Spain by instituting an [[eight-hour day]] and redistributing [[land tenure]] to farm workers.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=42}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=22}} The rural workers lived in some of the worst poverty in Europe at the time and the government tried to increase their wages and improve working conditions. This estranged small and medium landholders who used hired labour. The Law of Municpal Boundaries forbade the hiring of workers from outside the locality of the owner's holdings. Since not all localities had enough labour for the tasks required, the law had unintended negative consequences, such as sometimes shutting out peasants and renters from the labour market when they needed extra income as pickers. Labour arbitration boards were set up to regulate salaries, contracts and working hours; they were more favourable to workers than employers and thus the latter became hostile to them. A decree in July 1931 increased overtime pay and several laws in late 1931 restricted whom landowners could hire. Other efforts included decrees limiting the use of machinery, efforts to create a monopoly on hiring, strikes and efforts by unions to limit women's employment to preserve a labour monopoly for their members. Class struggle intensified as landowners turned to counterrevolutionary organisations and local oligarchs. Strikes, workplace theft, arson, robbery and assaults on shops, strikebreakers, employers and machines became increasingly common. Ultimately, the reforms of the Republican-Socialist government alienated as many people as they pleased.<ref>Seidman, Michael. \"The Victorious Counterrevolution.\" The Nationalist Effort in the (2011), pp.16-17</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Main altarpiece of the Church del Salvador (Elche) before it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width1 = 120\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Church del Salvador (Elche) after it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The Church was a frequent target of the revolutionary left in the Republic and in the War.

Spanish commentators spoke of chaos and preparation for revolution, foreign diplomats made plans in case of revolution and an interest in fascism developed among the threatened. Payne states that by July 1936:\n::\"The frequent overt violations of the law, assaults on property, and political violence in Spain were without precedent for a modern European country not undergoing total revolution. These included massive, sometimes violent and destructive strike waves, large-scale illegal seizures of farmland in the south, a wave of arson and destruction of property, arbitrary closure of Catholic schools, seizure of churches and Catholic property in some areas, widespread censorship, thousands of arbitrary arrests, virtual impunity for criminal action by members of Popular Front parties, manipulation and politicisation of justice, arbitrary dissolution of rightist organisations, coercive elections in Cuenca and Granada that excluded all opposition, subversion of the security forces, and a substantial growth in political violence, resulting in more than three hundred deaths. Moreover, because local and provincial governments were forcibly taken over, decreed by the government in much of the country rather than secured via any elections, they tended to have a coercive cast akin to that of local governments taken over by Italian Fascists in northern Italy during the summer of 1922. Yet as of early July the centrist and rightist opposition in Spain remained divided and impotent.\"<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Press. p.&nbsp;117.</ref>\n\nLaia Balcells observes that polarisation in Spain just before the coup was so intense that physical confrontations between leftists and rightists were a routine occurrence in most localities; six days before the coup occurred, there was a riot between the two in the province of Teruel. Balcells notes that Spanish society was so divided along Left-Right lines that the monk Hilari Raguer stated that in his parish, instead of playing \"cops and robbers\", children would sometimes play \"leftists and rightists.\"<ref>Balcells, Laia. Rivalry and revenge. Cambridge University Press, 2017. pp.58-59</ref> Within the first month of the Popular Front's government, nearly a quarter of the provincial governors had been removed due to their failure to prevent or control strikes, illegal land occupation, political violence and arson. The Popular Front government was more likely to persecute rightists for violence than leftists who committed similar acts. Aza\u00f1a was hesitant to use the army to shoot or stop rioters or protestors as many of them supported his coalition. On the other hand, he was reluctant to disarm the military as be believed he needed them to stop insurrections from the extreme left. Illegal land occupation became widespread - poor tenant farmers knew the government was disinclined to stop them. By April 1936, nearly 100,000 peasants had appropriated 400,000 hectares of land and perhaps as many as 1 million hectares by the start of the civil war; for comparison, the 1931-33 land reform had granted only 6000 peasants 45,000 hectares. As many strikes occurred between April and July as had occurred in the entirety of 1931. Workers increasingly demanded less work and more pay. \"Social crimes\" - refusing to pay for goods and rent - became increasingly common by workers, particularly in Madrid. In some cases this was done in the company of armed militants. Conservatives, the middle classes, businessmen and landowners became convinced that revolution had already begun.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

It would be only be by the end of April that General Emilio Mola would emerge as the leader of a national conspiracy network.<ref>Ruiz, Julius. The'red Terror'and the Spanish Civil War.

[[Emilio Mola]] was moved from head of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] to military commander of [[Pamplona]] in [[Navarre]].<ref name=\"Preston94\" /> This, however, allowed Mola to direct the mainland uprising.

The initial government would be an all-military \"Directory\", which would create a \"strong and disciplined state.\" General Sanjurjo would be the head of this new regime, due to being widely liked and respected within the military, though his position would be a largely symbolic due to his lack of political talent. The 1931 Constitution would be suspended, replaced by a new \"constituent parliament\" which would be chosen by a new politically purged electorate, who would vote on the issue of republic versus monarchy. Certain liberal elements would remain, such as separation of church and state as well as freedom of religion. Agrarian issues would be solved by regional commissioners on the basis of smallholdings but collective cultivation would be permitted in some circumstances. Legislation prior to February 1936 would be respected.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Stanley G. Payne. The Spanish civil war.

Castillo was a Socialist party member who, among other activities, was giving military training to the UGT youth. Castillo had led the Assault Guards that violently suppressed the riots after the funeral of ''Guardia Civil'' lieutenant Anastasio de los Reyes. (Los Reyes had been shot by anarchists during 14 April military parade commemorating the five years of the Republic.)<ref name=\"preston98\" />\n\nAssault Guard Captain Fernando Cond\u00e9s was a close personal friend of Castillo. The next day, he led his squad to arrest [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones]], founder of CEDA, as a reprisal for Castillo's murder. But he was not at home, so they went to the house of [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo]], a leading Spanish [[monarchism|monarchist]] and a prominent parliamentary conservative.<ref name=\"preston99\" /> Luis Cuenca, a member of the arresting group and a Socialist who was known as the bodyguard of [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leader [[Indalecio Prieto]], [[summary execution|summarily executed]] Calvo Sotelo by shooting him in the back of the neck.<ref name=\"preston99\">Preston (2006), p. 99.</ref> [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] concludes that Cond\u00e9s intended to arrest Sotelo, and that Cuenca acted on his own initiative, although he acknowledges other sources dispute this finding.<ref>Thomas (2001). pp. 196\u2013198, 309</ref>\n\nMassive reprisals followed.<ref name=\"preston99\" /> The killing of Calvo Sotelo with police involvement aroused suspicions and strong reactions among the government's opponents on the right.<ref>Thomas (2001). pp. 196\u2013198, 309.</ref> Although the nationalist generals were already planning an uprising, the event was a catalyst and a public justification for a coup.<ref name=\"preston99\" /> [[Stanley G. Payne|Stanley Payne]] claims that before these events, the idea of rebellion by army officers against the government had weakened; Mola had estimated that only 12% of officers reliably supported the coup and at one point considered fleeing the country for fear he was already compromised, and had to be convinced to remain by his co-conspirators.<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres. pp115</ref> So according to Payne, the kidnapping and murder of Sotelo transformed the \"limping conspiracy\" into a revolt that could trigger a civil war. The involvement of forces of public order and a lack of action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken; Payne points to a possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. The murder of a parliamentary leader by state police was unprecedented, and the belief that the state had ceased to be neutral and effective in its duties encouraged important sectors of the right to join the rebellion.<ref>Seidman, Michael. Transatlantic Antifascisms: From the Spanish Civil War to the End of World War II.

The Regular Spanish Air force commander [[Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda La Calle]] was openly critical of Malraux's military efficiency but recognised his usefulness as a propagandist. His novel ''L'Espoir'' and the film version he produced and directed (''[[Espoir: Sierra de Teruel]]'') were a great help for the Republican cause in France.\n\nEven after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war. German intelligence reported to Franco and the Nationalists that the French military was engaging in open discussions about intervention in the war through French military intervention in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.<ref>Payne (2008). p. 28.</ref> In 1938, Franco feared an immediate French intervention against a potential Nationalist victory in Spain through French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.<ref>Luke\u0161, Goldstein (1999). p. 176.</ref>\n\n== Course of the war ==\n=== 1936 ===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War, 1936}}\n[[File:Map of the Spanish Civil War in September 1936.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Map showing Spain in September 1936:{{legend|#f49ac1|Area under Nationalist control}}{{legend|#8393ca|Area under Republican control}}]]\nA large air and [[sealift]] of Nationalist troops in Spanish Morocco was organised to the southwest of Spain.<ref>Beevor (2006). p. 71.</ref> Coup leader Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on 20 July,<ref>Beevor (2006). p. 96.</ref><ref>Thomas (1961). p. 162.</ref> leaving an effective command split between Mola in the North and Franco in the South.<ref name=\"Preston1983\" /> This period also saw the worst actions of the so-called \"[[Red Terror (Spain)|Red]]\" and \"[[White Terror (Spain)|White Terrors]]\" in Spain.<ref>Red: Beevor (2006). pp. 81\u201387.</ref><ref>White: Beevor (2006). pp. 88\u201394.</ref> On 21 July, the fifth day of the rebellion, the Nationalists captured the central [[Spanish Navy|Spanish naval base]], located in [[Ferrol, Galicia]].<ref>Beevor (2006). pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nA rebel force under Colonel [[Alfonso Beorlegui Canet]], sent by General Mola and Colonel Esteban Garc\u00eda, undertook the [[Campaign of Gipuzkoa]] from July to September.

Financing the war posed enormous challenge for both the Nationalists and the Republicans.\n\nThe two combatant parties followed similar financial strategies; in both cases money creation, rather than new taxes or issue of debt, was key to financing the war.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 1</ref> \n\nBoth sides relied mostly on domestic resources; in case of the Nationalists they amounted to 63% of the overall spendings ($1,28bn) and in case of the Republicans they stood at 59% ($1,09bn). In the Nationalist zone money creation was responsible for some 69% of domestic resources, while in the Republican one the corresponding figure stood at 60%;<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 11</ref> it was accomplished mostly by means of advances, credits, loans and debit balances from respective central banks.<ref>Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-12</ref> However, while in the Nationalist zone the rising stock of money was only marginally above the production growth rate, in the Republican zone it by far exceeded dwindling production figures. The result was that while by the end of the war the Nationalist inflation was 41% compared to 1936, the Republican one was in triple digits. The second component of domestic resource was fiscal revenue. In the Nationalist zone it grew steadily and in the 2nd half of 1938 it was 214% of the figure from the 2nd half of 1936.<ref>in nominal terms, in terms of purchasing power the growth was smaller; nominal figures were 396m ptas in the 2nd half of 1936 and 847m ptas in the 2nd half of 1938, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 10</ref>. In the Republican zone fiscal revenues in 1937 dropped to some 25% of revenues recorded in the proportional area in 1935, but recovered slightly in 1938. Neither side re-engineered the pre-war tax system; differences resulted from dramatic problems with tax collection in the Republican zone and from the course of the war, as more and more population was governed by the Nationalists. A smaller percentage of domestic resources came from expropriations, donations or internal borrowing.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 7-11</ref>\n\nForeign resources amounted to 37% in case of the Nationalists ($0,76bn) and 41% in case of the Republicans ($0,77bn).<ref>when assessing financial cost of waging the war, some scholars limit their analysis to foreign resources only and set expenditures of both sides at some $0,7bn each, compare e.g. Romero Salvado, Francisco J. (2013), ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9780810857841}}, p. 20. Similarly, another author claims that \"the republican authorities obtained 714 million dollars, and this was the financial cost of the civil war for the Republicans\", while \"the financial cost of the war on the Francoist side was very similar, between 694 and 716 million dollars\", Casanova, Julian (2013), ''The Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9781848856578}}, p. 91. The same author claims in the same work that \"losing the war cost the Republic almost as much as Franco spent on winning it, some six hundred million dollars on each side\" (p. 185)</ref> For the Nationalists it was mostly the Italian and German credit;<ref>exact figures differ; one source claims $0,45bn for Italy and $0,23bn for Germany, Romero Salvado 2013, p. 20; the rest was mostly private credit from British (e.g. Rio Tinto) or US (e.g. Texaco) companies</ref> in case of the Republicans it was sales of gold reserves, mostly to the USSR and in much smaller amount to France. None of the sides resolved to public borrowing and none floated debt on foreign exchange markets.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-14</ref>\n\nAuthors of recent studies suggest that given Nationalist and Republican spendings were comparable, earlier theory pointing to Republican mismanagement of resources is no longer tenable.<ref>earlier studies suggested that the Republican military expenditures were 4 times larger than the Nationalist ones (40bn ptas v. 12bn ptas); the conclusion drawn was that the Republicans have grossly mismanaged their resources. Recent studies claim that the above figures are calculated in nominal terms, and that entirely different picture emerges when inflation and exchange rates are taken into account, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 2-3</ref> Instead, they claim that the Republicans failed to translate their resources into military victory largely because of constraints of the international non-intervention agreement; they were forced to spend in excess of market prices and accept goods of lower quality. Initial turmoil in the Republican zone contributed to problems, while at later stages the course of the war meant that population, territory and resources kept shrinking.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 25-26</ref>\n\n== Death toll ==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left; font-size:13px; float:left; margin:5px\"\n|- style=\"font-size: small;\"\n| colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Civil War death toll'''\n|-\n! range || estimate\n|-\n| +2m || 2,000,000<ref>highest considered estimate; \"la guerra civil fue una espantosa calamidad en la que todas las clases y todos los partidos perdieron.

The Spanish Nationalists, in contrast, imposed a puritanically terrorist order on the populace in their territory. They never suffered from serious partisan activity behind their lines and the fact that banditry did not develop into a serious problem in Spain, despite how easy it would have been in such mountainous terrain, demands explanation.

Prominent Spanish pacifists, such as [[Amparo Poch y Gasc\u00f3n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Brocca]], supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means, including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies, and through humanitarian work with war refugees.{{NoteTag|See variously: Bennett, Scott, ''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915\u20131963'', Syracuse NY, Syracuse University Press, 2003; Prasad, Devi, ''War Is a Crime Against Humanity: The Story of War Resisters' International'', London, WRI, 2005.

Motion pictures, posters, books, radio programs, and leaflets are a few examples of this media art that was so influential during the war. Produced by both nationalists and republicans, propaganda allowed Spaniards a way to spread awareness about their war all over the world. A film co-produced by famous early-twentieth century authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Lillian Hellman]] was used as a way to advertise Spain's need for military and monetary aid. This film, ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', premiered in America in July 1937. In 1938, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', a personal account of his experiences and observations in the war, was published in the United Kingdom. In 1939, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in France a short story, [[The Wall (Sartre short story collection)|\"The Wall\"]] in which he describes the last night of prisoners of war sentenced to death by shooting.\n\nLeading works of sculpture include [[Alberto S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez]]'s ''El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella'' (\"The Spanish People Have a Path that Leads to a Star\"), a 12.5&nbsp;m monolith constructed out of plaster representing the struggle for a socialist utopia;<ref name=\"museonacional\">[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/pueblo-espanol-tiene-camino-que-conduce-estrella-maqueta-there-way-spanish-people Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia], El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella (maqueta) (There Is a Way for the Spanish People That Leads to a Star [Maquette]).</ref> [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez's]] ''La Montserrat'', an anti-war work which shares its title with a mountain near Barcelona, is created from a sheet of iron which has been hammered and welded to create a peasant mother carrying a small child in one arm and a sickle in the other. and [[Alexander Calder]]'s ''Fuente de mercurio'' (Mercury Fountain) a protest work by the American against the Nationalist forced control of Almad\u00e9n and the mercury mines there.<ref name=\"montserrat\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2231 Museum of Modern Art].</ref>\n\n[[Pablo Picasso]] painted [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']] in 1937, taking inspiration from the bombing of Guernica, and in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Battle of Anghiari]]''.

Ni\u00f1os espa\u00f1oles que encontraron en M\u00e9xico un hogar.JPG|thumb|Spanish children in exile in [[Mexico]]]]\nAfter the War, the Francoist regime initiated a repressive process against the losing side, a \"cleansing\" of sorts against anything or anyone associated with the Republic. This process led many to exile or death. \nExile happened in three waves. The first one was during the Northern Campaign (March\u2013November 1937), followed by a second wave after the fall of Catalonia (January\u2013February 1939), in which about 400,000 people fled to France. The French authorities had to improvise concentration camps, with such hard conditions that almost half of the exiled Spaniards returned. The third wave occurred after the War, at the end of March 1939, when thousands of Republicans tried to board ships to exile, although few succeeded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bahamonde |first1=\u00c1ngel |last2=Cervera Gil |first2=Javier |title=As\u00ed termin\u00f3 la Guerra de year |publisher=Marcial Pons |location=Madrid |isbn = 84-95379-00-7}}</ref>\n\n=== International relations ===\nThe political and emotional repercussions of the War transcended the National scale, becoming a precursor to [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Payne |first = Stanley G. |title=Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II |date=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15021-6 |page = 336 |jstor=j.ctt5vks5w}}</ref> The war has frequently been described as the \"prelude to\" or the \"opening round of\" the Second World War, as part of an international battle against fascism. However Stanley Payne suggests this isn't accurate, arguing that the international alliance that was created in December 1941, once the United States entered WW2, was politically much broader than the Spanish Popular Front as it included conservative capitalist states such as Great Britain and the United States; indeed it included the equivalent of many forces on Franco's side. The Spanish Civil War, Payne argues, was thus a much more clear-cut revolutionary/counterrevolutionary battle between the left and right, while the Second World War initially had the fascists and communists on the same side with the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe. Payne suggests that instead the civil war was the last of the revolutionary crises that emerged from the First World War, observing it had parallels such as: (1) the complete revolutionary breakdown of domestic institutions, (2) the development of full-scale revolutionary/counterrevolutionary war, (3) development of a typical post-World War One Red Army in the form of the People's Army, (4) an extreme exacerbation of nationalism, (5) frequent use of World War One style military material and concepts and (6) the fact that it was not the product of the plan of any the major powers, making it more similar to the post-First World War crises.<ref>Payne, Stanley G.

However, the end of the Civil War and later the Second World War saw the isolation of the country from most other nations until the 1950s, in which the American anti-Communist international policy favoured having a far-right and extremely anti-communist ally in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Alexander |title=Base Politics : Democratic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn = 978-0801446054 |pages=57\u201364 |url = http://search.ebscohost.com.ccl.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=671393&site=ehost-live&scope=site.}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"<!-- do not collapse, per [[MOS:COLLAPSE]] -->\n|-\n!

The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] by [[communist]] and [[socialist]] parties, under the leadership of [[centre-left]] President [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=43}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=84}} The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups, including [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|CEDA]], monarchists, including both the opposing [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] and the religious conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]], and the [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|FE de las JONS]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] political party.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}} After the deaths of Sanjurjo, [[Emilio Mola]] and [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n\nThe coup was supported by military units in the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], [[Pamplona]], [[Burgos]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Valladolid]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and [[Seville]]. However, rebelling units in some important cities\u2014such as [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]], and [[M\u00e1laga]]\u2014did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the Republican side received support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]]. Other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[United States]], continued to recognise the Republican government, but followed an official policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]]. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican [[International Brigades]], which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n\nThe Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of [[Catalonia]] was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the recognition of the Francoist regime by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939, and internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in March 1939, Franco entered the capital and declared victory on 1 April 1939. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled to refugee camps in [[southern France]].<ref name=\"historytoday.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/refugees-and-spanish-civil-war |title = Refugees and the Spanish Civil War &#124; History Today}}</ref><ref name=\"historytoday.com\"/> Those associated with the losing Republicans who stayed were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. Franco established a dictatorship in which all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}}\n\nThe war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and for the many atrocities that occurred, on both sides. Organised [[purge]]s occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces so they could consolidate their future regime.<ref>Beevor (2006). p. 88.</ref> Mass executions on a lesser scale also took place in areas controlled by the Republicans,<ref>Beevor (2006). pp.&nbsp;86\u201387.</ref> with the participation of local authorities varying from location to location.<ref>Beevor (2006). pp.&nbsp;260\u2013271.</ref><ref>Julius Ruiz.

Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms. Some liberals, in a tradition that started with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], sought to limit the power of the [[monarchy of Spain]] and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 were overturned when [[King Ferdinand VII]] dissolved the Constitution and ended the [[Trienio Liberal]] government.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' as well as all the important government positions.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=19}}\n\nIn 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of [[Queen Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by [[Joan Prim|General Joan Prim]]) concerned with the ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;13.</ref><ref>Preston (2006). p.&nbsp;21.</ref> After the [[Restoration (Spain)|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874,<ref>Preston (2006). p. 22.</ref> [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] emerged in opposition to the monarchy.<ref>Preston (2006). p. 24.</ref><ref>Fraser (1979). pp.&nbsp;38\u201339.</ref> [[Alejandro Lerroux]], Spanish politician and leader of the [[Radical Republican Party]], helped bring [[republicanism]] to the fore in [[Catalonia]], where poverty was particularly acute.<ref>Preston (2006). pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Growing resentment of [[conscription]] and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1909.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfonso XIIIdeEspa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|On 12 April 1931, the Republicans won the elections and the [[Spanish Second Republic]] was proclaimed two days later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] resigned and went into exile.]]\n[[Spain]] was neutral in [[World War I]]. Following the war, wide swathes of Spanish society, including the armed forces, united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful.<ref>Preston (2006). pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Popular perception of communism as a major threat significantly increased during this period.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=15}} In 1923, a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] brought [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to power; as a result, Spain transitioned to government by military dictatorship.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Support for the Rivera regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. He was replaced by General [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]], who was in turn himself replaced by [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as|Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as]]; both men continued a policy of rule by decree. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities. Consequently, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] gave in to popular pressure for the establishment of a republic in 1931 and called municipal elections for 12 April of that year. The socialist and liberal republicans won almost all the provincial capitals, and following the resignation of Aznar's government, King Alfonso XIII fled the country.<ref>Beevor (2006) pp.&nbsp;20\u201322.</ref> At this time, the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed. It remained in power until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=20}}\n\nThe revolutionary committee headed by [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] became the provisional government, with Alcal\u00e1-Zamora as [[President (government title)|president]] and [[head of state]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=23}} The republic had broad support from all segments of society.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=38\u201339}} In May, an incident where a taxi driver was attacked outside a monarchist club sparked anti-clerical violence throughout [[Madrid]] and south-west [[Spain]]. The government's slow response disillusioned the right and reinforced their view that the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] was determined to persecute the church. In June and July the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], known as the CNT, called several [[Strike action|strikes]], which led to a violent incident between CNT members and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and a brutal crackdown by the Civil Guard and the [[Spanish Army|army]] against the CNT in [[Seville]]. This led many workers to believe the Spanish Second Republic was just as oppressive as the monarchy, and the CNT announced its intention of overthrowing it via [[revolution]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=26}} Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and [[Socialism|Socialists]].<ref>Preston (2006). p. 50.</ref> With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the government tried to assist rural Spain by instituting an [[eight-hour day]] and redistributing [[land tenure]] to farm workers.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=42}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=22}} The rural workers lived in some of the worst poverty in Europe at the time and the government tried to increase their wages and improve working conditions. This estranged small and medium landholders who used hired labour. The Law of Municpal Boundaries forbade the hiring of workers from outside the locality of the owner's holdings. Since not all localities had enough labour for the tasks required, the law had unintended negative consequences, such as sometimes shutting out peasants and renters from the labour market when they needed extra income as pickers. Labour arbitration boards were set up to regulate salaries, contracts and working hours; they were more favourable to workers than employers and thus the latter became hostile to them. A decree in July 1931 increased overtime pay and several laws in late 1931 restricted whom landowners could hire. Other efforts included decrees limiting the use of machinery, efforts to create a monopoly on hiring, strikes and efforts by unions to limit women's employment to preserve a labour monopoly for their members. Class struggle intensified as landowners turned to counterrevolutionary organisations and local oligarchs. Strikes, workplace theft, arson, robbery and assaults on shops, strikebreakers, employers and machines became increasingly common. Ultimately, the reforms of the Republican-Socialist government alienated as many people as they pleased.<ref>Seidman, Michael. \"The Victorious Counterrevolution.\" The Nationalist Effort in the (2011), pp.16-17</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Main altarpiece of the Church del Salvador (Elche) before it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width1 = 120\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Church del Salvador (Elche) after it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The Church was a frequent target of the revolutionary left in the Republic and in the War.

Spanish commentators spoke of chaos and preparation for revolution, foreign diplomats made plans in case of revolution and an interest in fascism developed among the threatened. Payne states that by July 1936:\n::\"The frequent overt violations of the law, assaults on property, and political violence in Spain were without precedent for a modern European country not undergoing total revolution. These included massive, sometimes violent and destructive strike waves, large-scale illegal seizures of farmland in the south, a wave of arson and destruction of property, arbitrary closure of Catholic schools, seizure of churches and Catholic property in some areas, widespread censorship, thousands of arbitrary arrests, virtual impunity for criminal action by members of Popular Front parties, manipulation and politicisation of justice, arbitrary dissolution of rightist organisations, coercive elections in Cuenca and Granada that excluded all opposition, subversion of the security forces, and a substantial growth in political violence, resulting in more than three hundred deaths. Moreover, because local and provincial governments were forcibly taken over, decreed by the government in much of the country rather than secured via any elections, they tended to have a coercive cast akin to that of local governments taken over by Italian Fascists in northern Italy during the summer of 1922. Yet as of early July the centrist and rightist opposition in Spain remained divided and impotent.\"<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Press. p.&nbsp;117.</ref>\n\nLaia Balcells observes that polarisation in Spain just before the coup was so intense that physical confrontations between leftists and rightists were a routine occurrence in most localities; six days before the coup occurred, there was a riot between the two in the province of Teruel. Balcells notes that Spanish society was so divided along Left-Right lines that the monk Hilari Raguer stated that in his parish, instead of playing \"cops and robbers\", children would sometimes play \"leftists and rightists.\"<ref>Balcells, Laia. Rivalry and revenge. Cambridge University Press, 2017. pp.58-59</ref> Within the first month of the Popular Front's government, nearly a quarter of the provincial governors had been removed due to their failure to prevent or control strikes, illegal land occupation, political violence and arson. The Popular Front government was more likely to persecute rightists for violence than leftists who committed similar acts. Aza\u00f1a was hesitant to use the army to shoot or stop rioters or protestors as many of them supported his coalition. On the other hand, he was reluctant to disarm the military as be believed he needed them to stop insurrections from the extreme left. Illegal land occupation became widespread - poor tenant farmers knew the government was disinclined to stop them. By April 1936, nearly 100,000 peasants had appropriated 400,000 hectares of land and perhaps as many as 1 million hectares by the start of the civil war; for comparison, the 1931-33 land reform had granted only 6000 peasants 45,000 hectares. As many strikes occurred between April and July as had occurred in the entirety of 1931. Workers increasingly demanded less work and more pay. \"Social crimes\" - refusing to pay for goods and rent - became increasingly common by workers, particularly in Madrid. In some cases this was done in the company of armed militants. Conservatives, the middle classes, businessmen and landowners became convinced that revolution had already begun.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

It would be only be by the end of April that General Emilio Mola would emerge as the leader of a national conspiracy network.<ref>Ruiz, Julius. The'red Terror'and the Spanish Civil War.

The initial government would be an all-military \"Directory\", which would create a \"strong and disciplined state.\" General Sanjurjo would be the head of this new regime, due to being widely liked and respected within the military, though his position would be a largely symbolic due to his lack of political talent. The 1931 Constitution would be suspended, replaced by a new \"constituent parliament\" which would be chosen by a new politically purged electorate, who would vote on the issue of republic versus monarchy. Certain liberal elements would remain, such as separation of church and state as well as freedom of religion. Agrarian issues would be solved by regional commissioners on the basis of smallholdings but collective cultivation would be permitted in some circumstances. Legislation prior to February 1936 would be respected.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Stanley G. Payne. The Spanish civil war.

Castillo was a Socialist party member who, among other activities, was giving military training to the UGT youth.

Payne|Stanley Payne]] claims that before these events, the idea of rebellion by army officers against the government had weakened; Mola had estimated that only 12% of officers reliably supported the coup and at one point considered fleeing the country for fear he was already compromised, and had to be convinced to remain by his co-conspirators.<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres. pp115</ref> So according to Payne, the kidnapping and murder of Sotelo transformed the \"limping conspiracy\" into a revolt that could trigger a civil war. The involvement of forces of public order and a lack of action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken; Payne points to a possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. The murder of a parliamentary leader by state police was unprecedented, and the belief that the state had ceased to be neutral and effective in its duties encouraged important sectors of the right to join the rebellion.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

Finally, the final months of 1936 saw the arrival of foreign troops, International Brigades joining the Republicans and Italian CTV, German Legion Condor and Portuguese Viriatos joining the Nationalists. The result was that in April 1937 there were some 360,000 soldiers in the Republican ranks and some 290,000 in the Nationalist ones.<ref>Payne (1970), pp. 329\u2013330</ref>\n\n[[File:Republican forces during the Battle of Ir\u00fan.jpg|thumb|Republican forces during the [[battle of Ir\u00fan]] in 1936]]\n\nThe armies kept growing. The principal source of manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting more aggressively, and there was little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while on the Republican side the influx of new ''interbrigadistas'' did not cover losses on the front. At the turn of 1937/1938, each army numbered about 700,000.<ref>Payne (2012), p. 188</ref>\n\nThroughout 1938, the principal if not exclusive source of new men was a draft; at this stage it was the Republicans who conscripted more aggressively, and only 47% of their combatants were in age corresponding to the Nationalist conscription age limits.<ref>following the Battle of Ebro the Nationalists have established that only 47% of Republican POWs taken were in age corresponding to the Nationalist conscription age; 43% were older and 10% were younger, Payne, Stanley G., ''The Spanish civil War, the Soviet Union, and communism'', Yale University Press, 2008, p. 269</ref> Just prior to the Battle of Ebro, Republicans achieved their all-time high, slightly above 800,000; yet Nationalists numbered 880,000.<ref>Payne (2012), p. 299</ref> The Battle of Ebro, fall of Catalonia and collapsing discipline caused a great shrinking of Republican troops.

Catholic support became particularly pronounced as a consequence of the burning of churches and killing of priests in most leftists zones during the first six months of the war.

His novel ''L'Espoir'' and the film version he produced and directed (''[[Espoir: Sierra de Teruel]]'') were a great help for the Republican cause in France.\n\nEven after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war.

Financing the war posed enormous challenge for both the Nationalists and the Republicans.\n\nThe two combatant parties followed similar financial strategies; in both cases money creation, rather than new taxes or issue of debt, was key to financing the war.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 1</ref> \n\nBoth sides relied mostly on domestic resources; in case of the Nationalists they amounted to 63% of the overall spendings ($1,28bn) and in case of the Republicans they stood at 59% ($1,09bn). In the Nationalist zone money creation was responsible for some 69% of domestic resources, while in the Republican one the corresponding figure stood at 60%;<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 11</ref> it was accomplished mostly by means of advances, credits, loans and debit balances from respective central banks.<ref>Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-12</ref> However, while in the Nationalist zone the rising stock of money was only marginally above the production growth rate, in the Republican zone it by far exceeded dwindling production figures. The result was that while by the end of the war the Nationalist inflation was 41% compared to 1936, the Republican one was in triple digits. The second component of domestic resource was fiscal revenue. In the Nationalist zone it grew steadily and in the 2nd half of 1938 it was 214% of the figure from the 2nd half of 1936.<ref>in nominal terms, in terms of purchasing power the growth was smaller; nominal figures were 396m ptas in the 2nd half of 1936 and 847m ptas in the 2nd half of 1938, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 10</ref>. In the Republican zone fiscal revenues in 1937 dropped to some 25% of revenues recorded in the proportional area in 1935, but recovered slightly in 1938. Neither side re-engineered the pre-war tax system; differences resulted from dramatic problems with tax collection in the Republican zone and from the course of the war, as more and more population was governed by the Nationalists. A smaller percentage of domestic resources came from expropriations, donations or internal borrowing.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 7-11</ref>\n\nForeign resources amounted to 37% in case of the Nationalists ($0,76bn) and 41% in case of the Republicans ($0,77bn).<ref>when assessing financial cost of waging the war, some scholars limit their analysis to foreign resources only and set expenditures of both sides at some $0,7bn each, compare e.g. Romero Salvado, Francisco J. (2013), ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9780810857841}}, p. 20. Similarly, another author claims that \"the republican authorities obtained 714 million dollars, and this was the financial cost of the civil war for the Republicans\", while \"the financial cost of the war on the Francoist side was very similar, between 694 and 716 million dollars\", Casanova, Julian (2013), ''The Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9781848856578}}, p. 91.

None of the sides resolved to public borrowing and none floated debt on foreign exchange markets.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-14</ref>\n\nAuthors of recent studies suggest that given Nationalist and Republican spendings were comparable, earlier theory pointing to Republican mismanagement of resources is no longer tenable.<ref>earlier studies suggested that the Republican military expenditures were 4 times larger than the Nationalist ones (40bn ptas v. 12bn ptas); the conclusion drawn was that the Republicans have grossly mismanaged their resources. Recent studies claim that the above figures are calculated in nominal terms, and that entirely different picture emerges when inflation and exchange rates are taken into account, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 2-3</ref> Instead, they claim that the Republicans failed to translate their resources into military victory largely because of constraints of the international non-intervention agreement; they were forced to spend in excess of market prices and accept goods of lower quality.

The Spanish Nationalists, in contrast, imposed a puritanically terrorist order on the populace in their territory. They never suffered from serious partisan activity behind their lines and the fact that banditry did not develop into a serious problem in Spain, despite how easy it would have been in such mountainous terrain, demands explanation.

Many people including, as they are now called, the ''insumisos'' (\"defiant ones\", [[conscientious objector]]s) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. Prominent Spanish pacifists, such as [[Amparo Poch y Gasc\u00f3n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Brocca]], supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means, including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies, and through humanitarian work with war refugees.{{NoteTag|See variously: Bennett, Scott, ''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915\u20131963'', Syracuse NY, Syracuse University Press, 2003; Prasad, Devi, ''War Is a Crime Against Humanity: The Story of War Resisters' International'', London, WRI, 2005.

Motion pictures, posters, books, radio programs, and leaflets are a few examples of this media art that was so influential during the war. Produced by both nationalists and republicans, propaganda allowed Spaniards a way to spread awareness about their war all over the world. A film co-produced by famous early-twentieth century authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Lillian Hellman]] was used as a way to advertise Spain's need for military and monetary aid. This film, ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', premiered in America in July 1937. In 1938, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', a personal account of his experiences and observations in the war, was published in the United Kingdom. In 1939, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in France a short story, [[The Wall (Sartre short story collection)|\"The Wall\"]] in which he describes the last night of prisoners of war sentenced to death by shooting.\n\nLeading works of sculpture include [[Alberto S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez]]'s ''El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella'' (\"The Spanish People Have a Path that Leads to a Star\"), a 12.5&nbsp;m monolith constructed out of plaster representing the struggle for a socialist utopia;<ref name=\"museonacional\">[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/pueblo-espanol-tiene-camino-que-conduce-estrella-maqueta-there-way-spanish-people Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia], El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella (maqueta) (There Is a Way for the Spanish People That Leads to a Star [Maquette]).</ref> [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez's]] ''La Montserrat'', an anti-war work which shares its title with a mountain near Barcelona, is created from a sheet of iron which has been hammered and welded to create a peasant mother carrying a small child in one arm and a sickle in the other. and [[Alexander Calder]]'s ''Fuente de mercurio'' (Mercury Fountain) a protest work by the American against the Nationalist forced control of Almad\u00e9n and the mercury mines there.<ref name=\"montserrat\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2231 Museum of Modern Art].</ref>\n\n[[Pablo Picasso]] painted [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']] in 1937, taking inspiration from the bombing of Guernica, and in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Battle of Anghiari]]''.

This process led many to exile or death. \nExile happened in three waves. The first one was during the Northern Campaign (March\u2013November 1937), followed by a second wave after the fall of Catalonia (January\u2013February 1939), in which about 400,000 people fled to France. The French authorities had to improvise concentration camps, with such hard conditions that almost half of the exiled Spaniards returned. The third wave occurred after the War, at the end of March 1939, when thousands of Republicans tried to board ships to exile, although few succeeded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bahamonde |first1=\u00c1ngel |last2=Cervera Gil |first2=Javier |title=As\u00ed termin\u00f3 la Guerra de year |publisher=Marcial Pons |location=Madrid |isbn = 84-95379-00-7}}</ref>\n\n=== International relations ===\nThe political and emotional repercussions of the War transcended the National scale, becoming a precursor to [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Payne |first = Stanley G. |title=Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II |date=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15021-6 |page = 336 |jstor=j.ctt5vks5w}}</ref> The war has frequently been described as the \"prelude to\" or the \"opening round of\" the Second World War, as part of an international battle against fascism. However Stanley Payne suggests this isn't accurate, arguing that the international alliance that was created in December 1941, once the United States entered WW2, was politically much broader than the Spanish Popular Front as it included conservative capitalist states such as Great Britain and the United States; indeed it included the equivalent of many forces on Franco's side. The Spanish Civil War, Payne argues, was thus a much more clear-cut revolutionary/counterrevolutionary battle between the left and right, while the Second World War initially had the fascists and communists on the same side with the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe. Payne suggests that instead the civil war was the last of the revolutionary crises that emerged from the First World War, observing it had parallels such as: (1) the complete revolutionary breakdown of domestic institutions, (2) the development of full-scale revolutionary/counterrevolutionary war, (3) development of a typical post-World War One Red Army in the form of the People's Army, (4) an extreme exacerbation of nationalism, (5) frequent use of World War One style military material and concepts and (6) the fact that it was not the product of the plan of any the major powers, making it more similar to the post-First World War crises.<ref>Payne, Stanley G.

However, the end of the Civil War and later the Second World War saw the isolation of the country from most other nations until the 1950s, in which the American anti-Communist international policy favoured having a far-right and extremely anti-communist ally in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Alexander |title=Base Politics : Democratic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn = 978-0801446054 |pages=57\u201364 |url = http://search.ebscohost.com.ccl.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=671393&site=ehost-live&scope=site.}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"<!-- do not collapse, per [[MOS:COLLAPSE]] -->\n|-\n!
