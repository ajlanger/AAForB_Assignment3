This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species at the end of the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms.\n\n==Paleogeography==\n[[File:280 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|230px|left|Geography of the Permian world]]\nDuring the Permian, all the [[Earth]]'s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the [[equator]] and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (\"[[Panthalassa]]\", the \"universal sea\"), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmeria]] continent [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] and drifted north to [[Laurasia]], causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the [[Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that would dominate much of the [[Mesozoic]] era. Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\"[[continental climate]]\") and [[monsoon]] conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored [[gymnosperm]]s, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as [[fern]]s that disperse [[spore]]s in a wetter environment. The first modern trees ([[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s) appeared in the Permian.\n\nThree general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits\u2014the [[Ural Mountains]] (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|Texas red beds.]] The [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]] is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Selwyn Rock 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inman Valley, South Australia|Selwyn Rock, South Australia]], an exhumed [[Glacial striation|glacial pavement]] of Permian age]]\nThe [[climate]] in the Permian was quite varied.

By the close of the Permian, [[trilobite]]s and a host of other marine groups became extinct.\n\n===Terrestrial biota===\nTerrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[arthropod]]s, and various types of [[List of Permian tetrapods|tetrapods]]. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of [[Pangaea]]. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared.<ref name=\"ucmp.berkeley.edu\"/> The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements.\n\nThe Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The [[swamp]]-loving [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]] trees of the Carboniferous, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]'', were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]] and early [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. At the close of the Permian, lycopod and [[Equisetopsida|equisete]] swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only on a series of equatorial islands in the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] that later would become [[South China (continent)|South China]].<ref>Xu, R. & Wang, X.-Q.

Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' flora. Oxygen levels were probably high there. The [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s also appeared during this period.\n\n====Insects====\nFrom the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] period until well into the Permian, the most successful insects were primitive [[Blattoptera|relatives of cockroaches]]. Six fast legs, four well-developed folding wings, fairly good eyes, long, well-developed antennae (olfactory), an omnivorous digestive system, a receptacle for storing sperm, a [[chitin]]-based [[exoskeleton]] that could support and protect, as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts, gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals.

[[Nautiloids]], a subclass of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence.\n\nThere is evidence that magma, in the form of [[flood basalt]], poured onto the Earth's surface in what is now called the [[Siberian Traps]], for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.<ref name=\"palaeos.com\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis involves ocean venting of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Portions of the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an [[Anoxic event|anoxic zone]], the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy [[ozone]] in the upper atmosphere allowing [[ultraviolet]] radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas.<ref name=Kump>{{cite journal\n | author=Kump, L.R., A.

An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until [[Methane clathrate|frozen methane reservoirs]] below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent [[greenhouse gas]]es) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian\u2013Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|last2=Twitchett|first2=Richard J.|title=How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=7 July 2003|volume=18|issue=7|pages=358\u2013365|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4}}</ref>\n\nAn even more speculative hypothesis is that intense radiation from a nearby [[supernova]] was responsible for the extinctions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|title=Could a nearby supernova explosion have caused a mass extinction?|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=42852|pmid=11607506|volume=92|issue=1|date=January 1995|pages=235\u20138|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.235|arxiv=hep-ph/9303206|bibcode=1995PNAS...92..235E}}</ref>\n\nIt has been hypothesised that huge [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]] ([[Wilkes Land crater]]) with a diameter of around 500 kilometers in Antarctica represents an impact event that may be related to the extinction.<ref name=\"big bang\">{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica \u2013 Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Ohio State University Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=June 1, 2006| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> The crater is located at a depth of 1.6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica.

Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian\u2013Triassic layer do not approach those of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] layer. Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former, doubt is cast on the significance of a meteorite impact in creating the latter.

This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species at the end of the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms.\n\n==Paleogeography==\n[[File:280 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|230px|left|Geography of the Permian world]]\nDuring the Permian, all the [[Earth]]'s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the [[equator]] and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (\"[[Panthalassa]]\", the \"universal sea\"), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmeria]] continent [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] and drifted north to [[Laurasia]], causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the [[Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that would dominate much of the [[Mesozoic]] era. Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\"[[continental climate]]\") and [[monsoon]] conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored [[gymnosperm]]s, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as [[fern]]s that disperse [[spore]]s in a wetter environment. The first modern trees ([[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s) appeared in the Permian.\n\nThree general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits\u2014the [[Ural Mountains]] (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|Texas red beds.]] The [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]] is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Selwyn Rock 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inman Valley, South Australia|Selwyn Rock, South Australia]], an exhumed [[Glacial striation|glacial pavement]] of Permian age]]\nThe [[climate]] in the Permian was quite varied.

By the close of the Permian, [[trilobite]]s and a host of other marine groups became extinct.\n\n===Terrestrial biota===\nTerrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[arthropod]]s, and various types of [[List of Permian tetrapods|tetrapods]]. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of [[Pangaea]]. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared.<ref name=\"ucmp.berkeley.edu\"/> The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements.\n\nThe Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The [[swamp]]-loving [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]] trees of the Carboniferous, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]'', were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]] and early [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. At the close of the Permian, lycopod and [[Equisetopsida|equisete]] swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only on a series of equatorial islands in the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] that later would become [[South China (continent)|South China]].<ref>Xu, R. & Wang, X.-Q.

Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' flora.

It was the high tide of the [[anapsid]]s in the form of the massive [[pareiasaur]]s and host of smaller, generally lizard-like groups. A group of small reptiles, the [[diapsid]]s, started to abound. These were the ancestors to most modern reptiles and the ruling dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs and crocodiles.\n\n[[Synapsid]]s (the group that would later include mammals) thrived and diversified greatly at this time. Permian synapsids included some large members such as ''[[Dimetrodon]]''. The special adaptations of synapsids enabled them to flourish in the drier climate of the Permian and they grew to dominate the vertebrates.<ref name=\"Huttenlocker, A. K. 2012.

Ninety to 95% of marine species became [[Extinction|extinct]], as well as 70% of all land organisms. It is also the only known mass extinction of insects.<ref name=\"kgs.ku.edu\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/extinction/a/aa_permotrias.htm|title=The Great Permian-Triassic Extinction|author=Andrew Alden|work=About.com Education}}</ref> Recovery from the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event was protracted; on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover.<ref name=\"SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction\"/> [[Trilobite]]s, which had thrived since [[Cambrian]] times, finally became extinct before the end of the Permian. [[Nautiloids]], a subclass of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence.\n\nThere is evidence that magma, in the form of [[flood basalt]], poured onto the Earth's surface in what is now called the [[Siberian Traps]], for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.<ref name=\"palaeos.com\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis involves ocean venting of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Portions of the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an [[Anoxic event|anoxic zone]], the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy [[ozone]] in the upper atmosphere allowing [[ultraviolet]] radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas.<ref name=Kump>{{cite journal\n | author=Kump, L.R., A.

An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until [[Methane clathrate|frozen methane reservoirs]] below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent [[greenhouse gas]]es) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian\u2013Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|last2=Twitchett|first2=Richard J.|title=How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=7 July 2003|volume=18|issue=7|pages=358\u2013365|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4}}</ref>\n\nAn even more speculative hypothesis is that intense radiation from a nearby [[supernova]] was responsible for the extinctions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|title=Could a nearby supernova explosion have caused a mass extinction?|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=42852|pmid=11607506|volume=92|issue=1|date=January 1995|pages=235\u20138|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.235|arxiv=hep-ph/9303206|bibcode=1995PNAS...92..235E}}</ref>\n\nIt has been hypothesised that huge [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]] ([[Wilkes Land crater]]) with a diameter of around 500 kilometers in Antarctica represents an impact event that may be related to the extinction.<ref name=\"big bang\">{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica \u2013 Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Ohio State University Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=June 1, 2006| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> The crater is located at a depth of 1.6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica. Scientists speculate that this impact may have caused the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, although its age is bracketed only between 100 million and 500 million years ago. They also speculate that it may have contributed in some way to the separation of Australia from the Antarctic landmass, which were both part of a supercontinent called [[Gondwana]]. Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian\u2013Triassic layer do not approach those of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] layer. Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former, doubt is cast on the significance of a meteorite impact in creating the latter. Further doubt has been cast on this theory based on fossils in Greenland that show the extinction to have been gradual, lasting about eighty thousand years, with three distinct phases.<ref name=\"Shen2011\">{{cite journal|title=Calibrating the End-Permian Mass Extinction|author=Shen S.-Z.|year=2011|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1213454|bibcode = 2011Sci...334.1367S |display-authors=etal|pmid=22096103|volume=334|issue=6061|pages=1367\u201372|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/339648c1bbdf1feb2774e0fb6c977d6e6e35b44c}}</ref>\n\nMany scientists argue that the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event was caused by a combination of some or all of the hypotheses above and other factors; the formation of [[Pangaea]] decreased the number of coastal habitats and may have contributed to the extinction of many [[clade]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of fossil sites]] ''(with link directory)''\n* [[Olson's Extinction]]\n*[[List of Permian tetrapods]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|last=Ogg|first=Jim|date=June 2004|title=Overview of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSP's)|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/gssp.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040219015324/http://www.stratigraphy.org/gssp.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-02-19|website=stratigraphy.org|accessdate=April 30, 2006}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource portal|Paleozoic#Permian}}\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/permstrat.html University of California offers a more modern Permian stratigraphy]\n* [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/glassmts.html Classic Permian strata in the Glass Mountains of the Permian Basin]\n* {{cite web | title=International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)| work=Geologic Time Scale 2004| url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ | accessdate=September 19, 2005}}\n* [http://www.geo-lieven.com/erdzeitalter/perm/perm.htm Examples of Permian Fossils]\n* [https://ghkclass.com/ghkC.html?permian Permian (chronostratigraphy scale)]\n* {{citation |title= Extinguishing a Permian World |first=Elke |last= Schneebeli-Hermann |journal= Geology |volume= 40 |issue=3 |pages=287\u2013288 |doi= 10.1130/focus032012.1 |bibcode=2012Geo....40..287S |year= 2012 }}\n\n{{Geological history|p|p|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Permian| ]]\n[[Category:Geological periods]]\n[[Category:Paleozoic|.06]]\n", "name_user": "83.54.63.135", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian"}
