The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing. The words \"Central Bank of the Philippines\" were microprinted in the lower left border on the face of the note.\n\n==Coins==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n|+ BSP Coin Series (1995-2017)\n! colspan=\"2\"| Image \n! rowspan=\"2\"| Face Value \n! colspan=\"4\"| Technical parameters \n! colspan=\"3\"| Description \n! colspan=\"2\"| Years of Issue\n|- \n!

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing. The words \"Central Bank of the Philippines\" were microprinted in the lower left border on the face of the note.\n\n==Coins==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n|+ BSP Coin Series (1995-2017)\n! colspan=\"2\"| Image \n! rowspan=\"2\"| Face Value \n! colspan=\"4\"| Technical parameters \n! colspan=\"3\"| Description \n! colspan=\"2\"| Years of Issue\n|- \n!
