It primarily grows on fertile basalt and floodplain derived soils.\n\nThe Big Scrub existed in the [[Bundjalung people|Bundjalung]] [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] Nation. Traditionally the Bundjalung (particularly those that spoke the Widgjabal language of the Bundjalung nation) traversed it via walking trails, and maintained a few grassed clearings for camping and hunting within the rainforest. Rainforest [[bushfood]] were a regular part of the traditional Bundjalung diet, including staples like [[Castanospermum|Black Bean, ''Castanospermum australe'']], which is detoxified before eating.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2002/castanospermum-australe.html | title = Castanospermum australe, Black Bean, Moreton Bay Chestnut | publisher = [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] | access-date = 2016-02-19 | quote = The Black Bean has also proved valuable as a timber species, its seeds have been utilized - following extensive preparation as a food by Aborigines and it contains alkaloids which have been shown to have anti-HIV and anti -cancer properties.}}</ref>\n\nThe Big Scrub was dominated by White Booyong (''[[Heritiera trifiolata]]'') and [[Australian Red Cedar]] (''Toona australis''). The latter was eagerly sought by the 'cedar getters' for its fine quality timber. The cedar getters were the first non-indigenous people to exploit the Big Scrub area.\n\nLater, the [[Government of New South Wales]] gave allotments to potential farmers on the basis that they cleared it of rainforest. Hence, most of the Big Scrub was cleared, and the surviving Bundjalung were placed into reservations.\n\nIn the 20th century, interest in rainforest and conservation resulted in a greater effort to conserve the few remaining remnants of the Big Scrub. The major remnants are: the [[Booyong Flora Reserve]], [[Victoria Park Nature Reserve]], [[Davis Scrub Nature Reserve]], Boatharbour, and [[Hayters Hill Nature Reserve]]. These remnants have been subject to ecological restoration projects which involves the removal of invasive non-native weeds.\n\nBig Scrub remnants have become a source of native foods for cropping, especially in recent years. These include the [[macadamia]] nut, [[riberry]] and [[Finger Lime]].\nMacadamia nut is now grown commercially over much of the former Big Scrub area, but the main species used in cropping, ''Macadamia integrifolia'', did not naturally occur in the Big Scrub.\n\n==Remnant trees of the Big Scrub==\n<gallery>\nImage:Gmelina 30 metres - DavisScrub.jpg|[[White Beech]] in a remnant of the Big Scrub - [[Alstonville, New South Wales|Alstonville]], [[NSW]]\nImage:White Booyong - Booyong Reserve.jpg|Twin White Booyong growing in a remnant of the Big Scrub - Booyong Reserve, [[NSW]]\nImage:Ficus macrophylla - Alstonville.jpg|Emergent [[Moreton Bay Fig]] growing in a remnant of the Big Scrub, [[Davis Scrub Nature Reserve|Davis Scrub]] near [[Alstonville, New South Wales|Alstonville]]\nImage:Syzygium francisii - Booyong Reserve - edited.jpg|[[Syzygium francisii]] - Booyong Reserve, near [[Lismore, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|environment}}}}\n* [[Andrew Johnston Big Scrub Nature Reserve]]\n* [[Booyong Flora Reserve]]\n* [[Davis Scrub Nature Reserve]]\n* [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia]]\n* [[Hayters Hill]]\n* [[Victoria Park Nature Reserve]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.bigscrubrainforest.org.au/|work=Big Scrub Rainforest Landcare Group|title=Homepage|year=2014 }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://nrgeology.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/geology-of-big-scrub-rainforest-part-1.html|work=Northern Rivers Geology|title=Northern Rivers Geology - Geology of the Bigscrub Part 1|year=2016}}\n\n{{coord missing|New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Forests of New South Wales]]\n\n\n{{NewSouthWales-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe '''Big Scrub''' was the largest area of [[subtropical]] lowland [[rainforest]] in eastern [[Australia]].
