Although Bizzarrini is usually credited as the designer of the 250 GTO, he and most other Ferrari engineers were fired in 1962 due to [[History of Ferrari#1961 - The great walkout|a dispute with Enzo Ferrari]] . Further development of the 250 GTO was overseen by new engineer [[Mauro Forghieri]], who worked with [[Scaglietti]] to continue development of the body.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\">{{Citation|title=Ferrari 250 GT Competition Cars|last1=Pourret|first1=Jess G.|year=1987|publisher=Haynes|isbn=0-85429-556-9}}</ref> The design of the car was a collaborative effort and cannot be ascribed to a single person.\n\nThe mechanical aspects of 250 GTO were relatively conservative at the time of its introduction, using engine and chassis components that were proven in earlier competition cars. The chassis of the car was based on that of the [[Ferrari 250#250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating [[Control arm|A-arm front suspension]], rear [[Beam axle#Live axle vs Dead axle|live-axle]] with [[Watt's linkage#Automobile suspension|Watt's linkage]], [[disc brake]]s, and [[Borrani]] wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. {{cvt|2953|cc|L|1|order=flip}} [[V12 engine|V12]] as used in the [[Ferrari TR#250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossa]] Le Mans winner. An all-alloy design utilizing a [[dry sump]] and six 38DCN [[Weber carburetors]], it produced approximately {{convert|300|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 7500 rpm and {{convert|30|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 5500 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]. The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with [[Porsche]]-type [[synchromesh]].<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\n[[Bizzarrini]] focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at [[Pisa University]] as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]]. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. The bodies were constructed by [[Scaglietti]], with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by [[Pininfarina]] (in the case of s/n 2643 GT). Cars were produced in many colours, with the most famous being the bright red \"Rosso Cina\".<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n[[File:Ferrari 250 GTO ser. no. 3647GT interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of 250 GTO (chassis 3647GT)|alt=Looking through open driver's window of a right-hand-drive car, showing brown steering wheel with three metal spokes, gear lever and dashboard]]\nThe [[Minimalism|minimalist]] interior of a 250 GTO reflects the car's racing intentions.

It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a ''Tipo 168/61'' 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Super America]] coupe. 2643 GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the [[1961 24 Hours of Le Mans|1961 24 hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Fernand Tavano]] and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]]. It finished 8th overall. During the course of the race, Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it, including the addition of a rear spoiler. During the Le Mans race, 2643 GT suffered from high-speed instability, possibly due to the front end design.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> Following Le Mans, 2643 GT returned to the factory, where it was used for more testing. The prototype raced again at the [[1962 Daytona 3 Hours|1962 Daytona Continental 3 hours]], where it placed 4th overall and 1st in the GT class driven by [[Stirling Moss]].<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drive-my.com/en/test-drive/item/2180-the-green-ferrari-250-gto-test.html|title=The green Ferrari 250 GTO - track test|last=Doherty|first=Paul|date=14 April 2015|website=Drive|language=en-gb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Subsequently, it was sold to [[North American Racing Team|N.A.R.T.]] and a succession of private owners.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2643GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT SWB Prototype Sperimentale s/n 2643GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe second prototype was constructed from a 1960 250 GT SWB, chassis 2053 GT.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /><ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2053GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT s/n 2053GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Alternatively, some sources have claimed that a 250 GT Boano (0523GT) or a 1959 250 GT SWB (1791GT) was used as the donor car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoweek.com/car-life/a1902341/exactly-how-many-ferrari-250-gtos-were-built/|title=Exactly how many Ferrari 250 GTOs were built?|last=Severson|first=Aaron|date=31 July 2014|website=Autoweek|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferrari.com/english/gt_sport cars/classiche/all_models/Pages/articles_250_gto.aspx|title=Focus on: 250 GTO (1962)|last=|first=|date=|website=ferrari.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116014343/https://www.ferrari.com/english/gt_sport%20cars/classiche/all_models/Pages/articles_250_gto.aspx|archive-date=2012-11-16|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This prototype was created entirely by the Ferrari factory's racing department under the oversight of Giotto Bizzarrini, including the bodywork. The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminum. The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it \"Il Mostro\" (the Monster) and the press to call it \"The Anteater.\" Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nThe second prototype was tested at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223 GT and 3387 GT. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nAs 2053 GT was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped and the chassis given a 250 GT SWB style body. In this form it was sold to [[Jacques Swaters]]. It crashed during the [[6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|1962 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] and was then rebodied by [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]].

Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />  This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year, as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] decided to not approve the [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]] for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM's aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM's [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid engine rear wheel drive]] layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight. The GTO '64 still saw some racing success with factory and privateer teams, including an overall win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] in 1964 by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] driving for [[North American Racing Team|NART]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mallepelle|first=Paolo|date=1983|title=The 64 GTO|url=|journal=Cavallino|volume=16|pages=22\u201328|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/MO18/Monterey/lots/r0117-1962-ferrari-250-gto-by-scaglietti/695912|title=RM Sotheby's - 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO by Scaglietti {{!}} Monterey 2018|date=2018-08-26|work=RM Sotheby's|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Daytona-1964-02-16.html|title=Daytona 2000 Kilometres 1964 - Race Results - Racing Sports Cars|website=www.racingsportscars.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\nThree 330 GTO specials were made using the 250 GTO chassis and body fitted with [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Superamerica]] 4.0L motors.

These homologation papers were issued in 1960, but extensions were applied for and accepted multiple times between 1961 to 1964, allowing Ferrari to add modifications not covered under the original specification, including changes to the engine, transmission, and suspension.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=Ferrari 250 GTO|last=Bluemel, Keith.|date=1998|publisher=Bay View Books Ltd|others=Pourret, Jess G.|isbn=1-901432-15-7|location=Bideford, Devon|oclc=41014319}}</ref> Additionally, since more than 100 bodies had been built according to the earlier 250 GT SWB specification, FIA regulations allowed a new body to be designed, leading to the development of the new 250 GTO body style.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> This method of homologation was not unique to Ferrari, as similar methods were used to homologate the [[Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato]] and the [[Jaguar E-Type#Lightweight E-Type (1963\u201364, 2014\u2013present)|Jaguar E-Type Lightweight]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe 250 GTO's racing debut was at the 1962 [[12 Hours of Sebring]], driven by American [[Phil Hill]] (the Formula One World Driving Champion at the time) and Belgian [[Olivier Gendebien]]. Although originally annoyed that they were driving a GT-class car instead of one of the full-race [[Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossas]] competing in the prototype class, the experienced pair impressed themselves (and everyone else) by finishing second overall behind the Testa Rossa of [[Joakim Bonnier|Bonnier]] and [[Ludovico Scarfiotti|Scarfiotti]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/racing/ferrari-gto-history|title=Phil Hill on the Iconic Ferrari 250 GTO|last=Hill|first=Phil|date=2017-04-20|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nFerrari would go on to win the over 2000cc class of the FIA's [[International Championship for GT Manufacturers]] in 1962, 1963, and 1964,<ref>{{citation | first = Denis | last = Jenkinson | title = The Automobile Year Book of Sports Car Racing, 1982 | date = 1982 | page = 222 }}</ref> the 250 GTO being raced in each of those years. 250 GTOs also won the 1963 and 1964 [[Tour de France Automobile]], marking Ferrari's nine year dominance of that race.\n\nThe 250 GTO was one of the last front-engined cars to remain competitive at the top level of sports car racing. Before the advent of vintage racing, the 250 GTO, like other racing cars of the period, passed into obsolescence. Some were used in regional races, while others were used as road cars.\n\n== Collectibility ==\nWhile the GTO is now arguably the most valuable collector car in the world, it was merely a no-frills used race car in the late 1960s and very early 1970s. Many of the vehicles were offered at or acquired for four-figure (USD) sums. In contrast, restored [[Duesenberg Model J]]\u2019s often traded in the vicinity of $50,000 around 1970.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the late 1980s, [[classic car]] values rose rapidly and the 250 GTO became the most valuable Ferrari model, touted as the [[Ferrari]] that most completely embodies the characteristics of the manufacturer. Prices fell substantially during the car market crash of the early 90s, resulting in lows of $2,700,000 in September 1994 and $2,500,000 in May 1996. Prices began to climb again in the late 90s and have continued to rise through the present day. 250 GTOs have repeatedly broken records for most expensive car ever sold at auction or private sale.<ref name=\"Hemmings-20180605\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg.com\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg.com-2\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/1962-ferrari-250-gto-brings-48400000-monterey-set-new-record/|title=1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Brings $48,400,000 in Monterey to Set New Record {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=2018-08-27|work=Automobile Magazine|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/press_release/17205/|title=Bonhams : Ferrari 250 Gto Achieves $38,115,000 (\u00a322,843,633)A New World Auction Record At Bonhams Quail Lodge Sale|website=www.bonhams.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref> The current record for world's most expensive car was set in June 2018 when a 1963 250 GTO (chassis 4153GT) was sold to David MacNeil in a private sale for $70 million.<ref name=\"Hemmings-20180605\" /> On August 25, 2018, RM Sotheby's sold [[Greg Whitten]]'s 250 GTO 3413GT at their Monterey auction.<ref name=\":2\" /> The final price inclusive of buyer's fee was $48,405,000, representing a new record for most expensive car ever sold at auction.

The chassis of the car was based on that of the [[Ferrari 250#250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating [[Control arm|A-arm front suspension]], rear [[Beam axle#Live axle vs Dead axle|live-axle]] with [[Watt's linkage#Automobile suspension|Watt's linkage]], [[disc brake]]s, and [[Borrani]] wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. {{cvt|2953|cc|L|1|order=flip}} [[V12 engine|V12]] as used in the [[Ferrari TR#250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossa]] Le Mans winner.

The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with [[Porsche]]-type [[synchromesh]].<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\n[[Bizzarrini]] focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at [[Pisa University]] as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]]. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. The bodies were constructed by [[Scaglietti]], with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by [[Pininfarina]] (in the case of s/n 2643 GT).

It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a ''Tipo 168/61'' 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Super America]] coupe. 2643 GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the [[1961 24 Hours of Le Mans|1961 24 hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Fernand Tavano]] and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]]. It finished 8th overall. During the course of the race, Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it, including the addition of a rear spoiler. During the Le Mans race, 2643 GT suffered from high-speed instability, possibly due to the front end design.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> Following Le Mans, 2643 GT returned to the factory, where it was used for more testing.

The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminum. The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it \"Il Mostro\" (the Monster) and the press to call it \"The Anteater.\" Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nThe second prototype was tested at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223 GT and 3387 GT. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nAs 2053 GT was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped and the chassis given a 250 GT SWB style body. In this form it was sold to [[Jacques Swaters]]. It crashed during the [[6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|1962 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] and was then rebodied by [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]].

Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />  This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year, as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] decided to not approve the [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]] for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM's aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM's [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid engine rear wheel drive]] layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight. The GTO '64 still saw some racing success with factory and privateer teams, including an overall win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] in 1964 by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] driving for [[North American Racing Team|NART]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mallepelle|first=Paolo|date=1983|title=The 64 GTO|url=|journal=Cavallino|volume=16|pages=22\u201328|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/MO18/Monterey/lots/r0117-1962-ferrari-250-gto-by-scaglietti/695912|title=RM Sotheby's - 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO by Scaglietti {{!}} Monterey 2018|date=2018-08-26|work=RM Sotheby's|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Daytona-1964-02-16.html|title=Daytona 2000 Kilometres 1964 - Race Results - Racing Sports Cars|website=www.racingsportscars.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\nThree 330 GTO specials were made using the 250 GTO chassis and body fitted with [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Superamerica]] 4.0L motors.
