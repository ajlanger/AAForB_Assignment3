The strong family company is one of the world\u2019s leading forest machine manufacturers <ref>https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286234-ponsse-quality-comes-price-tag</ref>[1], and its customer-oriented operations are still guided by the wishes and needs of forest machine entrepreneurs. The Ponsse company was established by the forest machine entrepreneur [[Einari Vidgr\u00e9n]] in 1970. The company\u2019s roots are deep in the Finnish countryside and Finnish work, but nowadays the company is quite involved in the international market. Today, Ponsse's machines are used at logging sites in approximately 40 countries, and 80 per cent of the company\u2019s net sales come from exports.<ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin\n</ref> All machines are manufactured in the company\u2019s birthplace in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. Ponsse Group employs more than 1,800 people in 10 countries, and the company\u2019s shares are quoted on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic List. \n\n==History==\n===1970s - Early years===\n\nEntrepreneur [[Einari Vidgren]] receives encouraging feedback on machines he has built. He decides to set up a forest machine factory in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. However, help is required by the municipality of Vierem\u00e4 in order to finance the project. A meeting is held by the municipal council, and they vote on the matter. The council approves the proposal with a majority of a single vote. The work is completed by the end of 1970, and Ponsse Plc is established as a result. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Einari places an ad in the [[Helsingin Sanomat]] news paper in order to recruit an engineer for the factory. An application by Jouko Kelppe, a young engineer from [[Salo]], attracts the most attention. Jouko is hired to be the first ever engineer in the history of Ponsse. The manufacturing of the first machine is started in the spring of 1971. A forest machine contractor Eero Vainikainen is in the process of purchasing a [[Volvo]] or [[Valmet]] machine. However, after strong persuasion and visiting the Ponsse factory, he decides to buy the first ever Ponsse machine.
