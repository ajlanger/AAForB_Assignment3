The single was released on the band's own [[Reception Records]] label<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> with distribution through [[Red Rhino]].\n\nTwo more singles followed that did well on the independent charts helped by veteran [[BBC]] [[radio]] [[DJ]] [[John Peel]] who was one of their first champions.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He invited them to do a radio session (three songs from the session are included on the 1988 [[compilation album|compilation]] ''Tommy 1985-1987;'' the entire session had already been released as an [[Extended play|EP]] in 1986), starting a long collaboration. By the time the band started work on their debut album, a number of independent and major [[record company|record companies]] showed interest, but the band declined all offers and decided to keep releasing their material themselves. The album was released in 1987 and titled ''[[George Best (album)|George Best]]'' after the well-known [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[George Best|player]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Disagreement on production values with the record's [[record producer|producer]], [[Chris Allison]], led to the album being remixed by the band and their [[sound engineer|engineer]], Steve Lyon.\n\nUpon its release, the album was critically acclaimed and the band were soon classified, with some of their peers, as members of the 'shambling' or [[C86 (music)|C86]] scene, a categorisation that they vehemently declined (although they were featured on the original C86 compilation). Musically, the album featured fast-paced rhythm guitar; lyrically, apart from a few excursions into social critique (\"All This and More\") and politics (\"All About Eve\"), Gedge's main concerns (which would become his trademark) were [[love]], lust, heartbreak and revenge.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Soon after the release of ''George Best'', the early singles and radio sessions were compiled and released as ''[[Tommy (1985-1987)]].'' When Solowka, who has [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] roots, started fooling around with a Ukrainian folk tune during one of their Peel sessions,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> the idea arose to devote some of their radio time to recording their versions of Ukrainian folk songs, encouraged by Peel. To this end, two guest musicians were invited, [[singing|singer]]/[[violin]] player [[Len Liggins]] and [[mandolin]] player [[Roman Remeynes]], and three Peel sessions were recorded with Gedge temporarily limiting himself to playing [[rhythm guitar]] and arranging the songs.\n\nBetween the recording of the first and the second 'Ukrainian' session, Charman was fired from the band. His replacement was [[Simon Smith (drummer)|Simon Smith]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> who remained the band's drummer until 1997 and for a long time was, next to Gedge, the only other stable factor in the shifting line-ups. The band planned on releasing eight cuts from the Ukrainian sessions on a 10\" [[vinyl record|LP]] and an initial batch was pressed when Red Rhino went into [[receivership]]. Rather than trying to find a new distribution company, the band decided to fold their Reception label altogether and sign with a regular [[record company]]: [[RCA]].\n\n===The RCA era (1989-1993)===\nAlthough the band were criticized by some quarters for 'selling out', under the terms of their contract they were allowed their own choice of producer and singles.  They also had the option of releasing any singles rejected by the label independently without breach of contract. The band's new record company bought the initial Reception stock of the Ukrainian record from the band, pressed another batch, and released the record in April 1989 under the name of ''[[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0412\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438 \u0432 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0456\u043b\u0430]]'' (meaning 'Ukrainian John Peel Sessions'; the Latin [[transliteration]] ''Ukra\u00efnski Vistupi v Ivana Peela'' appeared on the sleeve's spine only).\n\nThe first proper album that The Wedding Present recorded for their new label was released in the same year 1989 and reunited them with Allison. ''[[Bizarro (album)|Bizarro]]''\u2019s lyrical themes were largely the same as before and the songs featured the same [[three-chord song|three-chord]] structures, but its production values had increased due to a larger recording budget. The album was recorded at Jacobs Studios by Steve Lyon and again mixed by him there. The album's companion single, \"Kennedy\", provided the band with their first British [[Top 40]] hit.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Seeing that they were growing more popular in the American college radio scene, the band turned towards America for their next project. The band decided to re-record ''Bizarro'' track \"Brassneck\" with the former [[Big Black]] frontman [[Steve Albini]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It was the start of a two-year collaboration: the next single, \"Corduroy\" and album, ''[[Seamonsters]]'', were also recorded by Albini<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> at [[Pachyderm Studio|Pachyderm Recording Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]].\n\n''[[Melody Maker]]'' likened listening to the record to sandpapering your ears. End of year readers polls, however, showed the opening track and lead single of the album, \"Dalliance\", amongst the top of the favourites list. Almost directly after recording the album, the band announced that they had sacked Solowka. His replacement was [[Paul Dorrington]] of local band, [[Tse Tse Fly (band)|Tse Tse Fly]] (also formerly of [[A.C. Temple]]). Solowka teamed up again with Liggins and Remeynes to form [[The Ukrainians]], and continued to blend post-punk with traditional Ukrainian music.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe next year saw the band release twelve 7\" singles in one year.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Each single had a limited pressing of 10,000 copies which all reached the Top 30 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> equalling [[Elvis Presley]]'s record for the most UK Top 30 hits in one year. To economise on songwriting, the [[B-side]]s consisted of cover versions of songs including [[Julee Cruise]]'s \"Falling\" (the theme tune from [[Twin Peaks]]). The singles and their B-sides, produced by various producers such as [[Ian Broudie]] ([[Lightning Seeds]]) and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] ([[The Rolling Stones]]) were collected on two albums, ''[[Hit Parade 1]]'' and ''[[Hit Parade 2]]''.\n\n''[[Seamonsters]]'', ''[[Hit Parade 1]]'' and ''[[Hit Parade 2]]'' were released in the [[United States]] in 1991 and 1992 by New York-based pseudo-indie label First Warning Records. Shortly after the 1992 singles scheme had ended, the band announced they were leaving RCA.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===The Island era (1994-1995)===\nThe band spent most of 1993 taking time off, occasionally playing gigs. A stopgap compilation of three more archive radio sessions, ''[[Peel Sessions 1987-1990]]'', was released by [[Strange Fruit Records|Strange Fruit]]. When they re-emerged in early 1994 with the news that they had signed to [[Island Records]], it was quickly followed by the announcement that Gregory had left the band, due to lack of enthusiasm, and was replaced by [[Darren Belk]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> For their next album, The Wedding Present again left for the United States and enlisted [[Steve Fisk]] ([[Screaming Trees]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]). The result was ''[[Watusi (album)|Watusi]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album's songs ranged from warm lo-fi pop (\"Gazebo\", \"Big Rat\") to semi-[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[Velvet Underground|Velvets]]-like workouts (\"Click Click\", \"Catwoman\").\n\nNo further albums were recorded for Island, and the best part of 1995 was spent the same way as 1993: touring, writing new material, no recording. Paul Dorrington decided to quit the band; no replacement was made as Belk doubled on bass and guitar. In the autumn of 1995, The Wedding Present released \"Sucker\", a self-financed single that was sold at their gigs only (it has since been included on compilation albums). Shortly after, the band signed with independent label [[Cooking Vinyl]].\n\n===The Cooking Vinyl era (1995-1997/99)===\nThe band, still a three-piece, recorded their newly written material and issued the [[motorcar|car]]-themed six-track mini-album, ''[[Mini (EP)|Mini]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Belk played both guitar and bass on the songs but struggled at the lead instrument. Shortly after releasing the album, [[Jayne Lockey]], who had already sung backing vocals on ''Mini'', was announced as the band's new bass player. Belk decided to quit the band and was replaced by [[Simon Cleave]]. Both Lockey and Cleave were former members of Tse Tse Fly, along with Paul Dorrington and Mark Goodham.\n\nThe band still had material from their sabbatical year and went into the studio again to record ''[[Saturnalia (The Wedding Present album)|Saturnalia]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  This proved to be the last new material by The Wedding Present for a long time. After playing a number of gigs to support the album, the last one in [[Liverpool]] on 18 January 1997, the band took a long sabbatical.\n\n===Contractual obligations and Cinerama (1997-2004)===\n{{main article|Cinerama (band)}}\n\nTo fulfill contractual obligations, two more compilations were released by Cooking Vinyl: another Peel sessions volume, ''[[John Peel Sessions 1992-1995]]'' (1998), and ''[[Singles 1995-1997]]'' (1999). Additionally, Strange Fruit offered another radio sessions compilation, ''[[Evening Sessions 1986-1994]]'' (1997), and the band's American label released ''[[Singles 1989-1991]]'' (1999), a 2CD package which added rarities and live tracks.  Gedge recorded an album, ''Va Va Voom'', in 1998 under the [[Cinerama (band)|Cinerama]] band name with his girlfriend, Sally Murrell, and some session musicians. The project became a full-time band.\n\nFollowing Gedge's split from Murrell in 2003, and with the increasing inclusion on Wedding Present songs in Cinerama's live sets (in previous years Gedge had good-naturedly refused calls from the audience to play Wedding Present songs, frequently replying \"that's another band\" or \"you're at the wrong gig\" ), Gedge effectively renamed Cinerama in 2004, keeping the line up, reflecting the change in sound over the years to the more familiar territory of The Wedding Present.\n\n===Reformation (2004-present)===\n[[File:The Wedding Present-01.jpg|thumb|250px|The Wedding Present in Barcelona in 2010.]]\nNews came in early September 2004 that Cinerama would be rebranded as The Wedding Present. The line-up was to be the same as the last line-up of Cinerama, which included Simon Cleave. The first new single, \"[[Interstate 5 (The Wedding Present song)|Interstate 5]]\", was issued on 15 November 2004, to lead off the new album, ''[[Take Fountain]]'', which was released on 14 February 2005. A second single, \"[[I'm From Further North Than You]]\", was released on 11 April 2005. Third and final single \"[[Ringway to SeaTac]]\" was released on 24 October 2005.\n\nAll singles, their B-sides and acoustic versions from this period were compiled on the 2006 compilation ''[[Search for Paradise: Singles 2004-5]]''. The release came with a bonus DVD compiling the videos for \"Don't Touch That Dial\" (a Cinerama single re-recorded for ''[[Take Fountain]]''), \"Interstate 5\", \"I'm From Further North Than You\", \"Ringway to SeaTac\" and others.\n\nThe Wedding Present toured [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the Spring of 2005 (with John Maiden on drums) and again in Europe towards the end of 2005 (this time, with Simon Pearson on drums). During Christmas 2006, guitarist Simon Cleave left the group and was replaced by the group's sound engineer Chris McConville - who played on the 2006 tours of North America (with Charlie Layton on drums) and Europe (with Graeme Ramsay on drums).\n\nUntil 2009 the line-up remained stable with Gedge, De Castro, McConville, and Ramsay co-writing. They recorded 17 songs with [[Steve Albini]] in January 2008, some of which have been played live at gigs in recent years. Titles include \"I've Lost the Monkey\", \"Soup\", \"Drink You Eat You\", \"Model, Actress, Whatever...\", \"The Thing I Like Most About Him Is His Girlfriend\", \"Twenty Jackies\", \"Swingers\", \"Peek-a-boo\", \"Hulk Loves Betty\", \"Boo Boo\", \"Palisades\", \"Santa Ana Winds\", \"Pinch Pull Twist Release\", \"The Trouble With Men\", \"Don't Take Me Home Until I'm Drunk\" and \"Spider-Man in Hollywood\".\n\nThe album ''[[El Rey (The Wedding Present album)|El Rey]]'' was released on 20 May 2008 in [[North America]] and 26 May 2008 in [[Europe]], accompanied by the [[music download|digital download]]-only single \"The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend\". A compilation of singles and remixes ''How The West Was Won'' was released towards the end of 2008 and accompanied by a single \"Holly Jolly Hollywood\". The Wedding Present also covered [[The Cure]]'s \"High\" for [[American Laundromat Records]] tribute \"Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure\".\n\nSome months before a short tour of the UK and Japan in March 2009, Chris McConville left the band and was replaced by former guitarist Simon Cleave, who left the band again later that year. Graeme Ramsay subsequently moved from drums to guitar and Charles Layton once again became their drummer.\n\nIn 2009 two The Wedding Present songs, \"[[I'm From Further North Than You]]\", and  \"[[Ringway to SeaTac]]\" appeared in the award-winning [[Monty Miranda]] directed independent film ''[[Skills Like This]]''.  The director was praised for his use of music in an integrated soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20skil.html | work=The New York Times | title=20-something Sloth and Larceny | first=Jeannette | last=Catsoulis | date=20 March 2009 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2010 it was announced that De Castro would not be touring with The Wedding Present for the Autumn 21st anniversary tour of ''Bizarro'', and that her last gig would be at 28 August 2010 at Gedge's mini festival \"At the Edge of the Sea\" in Brighton. This marked the end of a 12-year association with Gedge, stretching back to when Cinerama was formed. She was replaced by Pepe le Moko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitones.co.uk/news/ |title=News &#124; The Official home of The Wedding Present and Cinerama |publisher=Scopitones.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>\n[[File:The Wedding Present in Valencia 02.jpg|thumb|David Gedge, singer of The Wedding Present in Valencia, Spain.

The rest of the set was a mixture of songs from ''[[Valentina (The Wedding Present Album)|Valentina]]'' and the back catalogue. In April of the year, The Wedding Present toured Australia for the first time, playing concerts in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nOn 25 October 2012, the ''4 Songs'' Extended Player was released on download only. These four new songs (\"Journey Into Space\", \"Pain Perdu\", \"1000 Fahrenheit\" & \"Can You Keep a Secret\") recorded during the Valentina sessions could be downloaded following the purchase of 'Valentina: The Story of a Wedding Present, a book documenting the making of the long player itself. Valentina itself was re-released in May 2015 after being re-interpreted and re-recorded by David Gedge's other band Cinerama.\n\nIn early 2013 the band started a world tour including taking in the US, Australia and for the first time New Zealand. The Wedding Present played 'George Best' and 'The Hit Parade' in their entirety on this tour celebrating the 25th and 21st 'birthday' of these albums respectively.\n\nThe band released their ninth album, ''[[Going, Going...]]'' on 2 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pearis|first1=Bill|title=The Wedding Present ready new album \u2018Going, Going\u2026\u2019 (listen to two songs)|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-wedding-present-ready-new-album-going-going-listen-to-two-songs/|website=BrooklynVegan|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wedding Present release new album|url=https://www.scopitones.co.uk/archives/6669|website=Scopitones.co.uk|accessdate=12 September 2016|ref=ScopitonesGoing}}</ref>\n\n2017 saw the 30th anniversary of the release of ''[[George Best (album)|George Best]]'', an anniversary tour and a feature-length documentary about the record titled ''The Wedding Present: Something Left Behind''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scopitones.co.uk/archives/7135|title=GEORGE BEST DOCUMENTARY |website=Scopitones.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2019, the band issued a completely re-recorded version of 1988 compilation ''[[Tommy (The Wedding Present album)|Tommy]]'', plus their first picture disc - a 10\" single featuring two new songs.\n\nIn late 2019, the band toured playing [[Bizarro]] in its entirety.  During this tour the band were joined on guitar by Jon Stewart of [[Sleeper (band)|Sleeper]] and Chris Hardwick from [[My Life Story]] on drums.\n\n==Personnel==\n\n===Current===\n\n* David Gedge:

The single was released on the band's own [[Reception Records]] label<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> with distribution through [[Red Rhino]].\n\nTwo more singles followed that did well on the independent charts helped by veteran [[BBC]] [[radio]] [[DJ]] [[John Peel]] who was one of their first champions.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He invited them to do a radio session (three songs from the session are included on the 1988 [[compilation album|compilation]] ''Tommy 1985-1987;'' the entire session had already been released as an [[Extended play|EP]] in 1986), starting a long collaboration. By the time the band started work on their debut album, a number of independent and major [[record company|record companies]] showed interest, but the band declined all offers and decided to keep releasing their material themselves. The album was released in 1987 and titled ''[[George Best (album)|George Best]]'' after the well-known [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[George Best|player]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Disagreement on production values with the record's [[record producer|producer]], [[Chris Allison]], led to the album being remixed by the band and their [[sound engineer|engineer]], Steve Lyon.\n\nUpon its release, the album was critically acclaimed and the band were soon classified, with some of their peers, as members of the 'shambling' or [[C86 (music)|C86]] scene, a categorisation that they vehemently declined (although they were featured on the original C86 compilation). Musically, the album featured fast-paced rhythm guitar; lyrically, apart from a few excursions into social critique (\"All This and More\") and politics (\"All About Eve\"), Gedge's main concerns (which would become his trademark) were [[love]], lust, heartbreak and revenge.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Soon after the release of ''George Best'', the early singles and radio sessions were compiled and released as ''[[Tommy (1985-1987)]].'' When Solowka, who has [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] roots, started fooling around with a Ukrainian folk tune during one of their Peel sessions,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> the idea arose to devote some of their radio time to recording their versions of Ukrainian folk songs, encouraged by Peel. To this end, two guest musicians were invited, [[singing|singer]]/[[violin]] player [[Len Liggins]] and [[mandolin]] player [[Roman Remeynes]], and three Peel sessions were recorded with Gedge temporarily limiting himself to playing [[rhythm guitar]] and arranging the songs.\n\nBetween the recording of the first and the second 'Ukrainian' session, Charman was fired from the band. His replacement was [[Simon Smith (drummer)|Simon Smith]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> who remained the band's drummer until 1997 and for a long time was, next to Gedge, the only other stable factor in the shifting line-ups. The band planned on releasing eight cuts from the Ukrainian sessions on a 10\" [[vinyl record|LP]] and an initial batch was pressed when Red Rhino went into [[receivership]]. Rather than trying to find a new distribution company, the band decided to fold their Reception label altogether and sign with a regular [[record company]]: [[RCA]].\n\n===The RCA era (1989-1993)===\nAlthough the band were criticized by some quarters for 'selling out', under the terms of their contract they were allowed their own choice of producer and singles.  They also had the option of releasing any singles rejected by the label independently without breach of contract. The band's new record company bought the initial Reception stock of the Ukrainian record from the band, pressed another batch, and released the record in April 1989 under the name of ''[[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0412\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438 \u0432 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0456\u043b\u0430]]'' (meaning 'Ukrainian John Peel Sessions'; the Latin [[transliteration]] ''Ukra\u00efnski Vistupi v Ivana Peela'' appeared on the sleeve's spine only).\n\nThe first proper album that The Wedding Present recorded for their new label was released in the same year 1989 and reunited them with Allison. ''[[Bizarro (album)|Bizarro]]''\u2019s lyrical themes were largely the same as before and the songs featured the same [[three-chord song|three-chord]] structures, but its production values had increased due to a larger recording budget. The album was recorded at Jacobs Studios by Steve Lyon and again mixed by him there. The album's companion single, \"Kennedy\", provided the band with their first British [[Top 40]] hit.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Seeing that they were growing more popular in the American college radio scene, the band turned towards America for their next project. The band decided to re-record ''Bizarro'' track \"Brassneck\" with the former [[Big Black]] frontman [[Steve Albini]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It was the start of a two-year collaboration: the next single, \"Corduroy\" and album, ''[[Seamonsters]]'', were also recorded by Albini<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> at [[Pachyderm Studio|Pachyderm Recording Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]].\n\n''[[Melody Maker]]'' likened listening to the record to sandpapering your ears. End of year readers polls, however, showed the opening track and lead single of the album, \"Dalliance\", amongst the top of the favourites list. Almost directly after recording the album, the band announced that they had sacked Solowka. His replacement was [[Paul Dorrington]] of local band, [[Tse Tse Fly (band)|Tse Tse Fly]] (also formerly of [[A.C. Temple]]). Solowka teamed up again with Liggins and Remeynes to form [[The Ukrainians]], and continued to blend post-punk with traditional Ukrainian music.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe next year saw the band release twelve 7\" singles in one year.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Each single had a limited pressing of 10,000 copies which all reached the Top 30 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> equalling [[Elvis Presley]]'s record for the most UK Top 30 hits in one year. To economise on songwriting, the [[B-side]]s consisted of cover versions of songs including [[Julee Cruise]]'s \"Falling\" (the theme tune from [[Twin Peaks]]). The singles and their B-sides, produced by various producers such as [[Ian Broudie]] ([[Lightning Seeds]]) and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] ([[The Rolling Stones]]) were collected on two albums, ''[[Hit Parade 1]]'' and ''[[Hit Parade 2]]''.\n\n''[[Seamonsters]]'', ''[[Hit Parade 1]]'' and ''[[Hit Parade 2]]'' were released in the [[United States]] in 1991 and 1992 by New York-based pseudo-indie label First Warning Records. Shortly after the 1992 singles scheme had ended, the band announced they were leaving RCA.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===The Island era (1994-1995)===\nThe band spent most of 1993 taking time off, occasionally playing gigs. A stopgap compilation of three more archive radio sessions, ''[[Peel Sessions 1987-1990]]'', was released by [[Strange Fruit Records|Strange Fruit]]. When they re-emerged in early 1994 with the news that they had signed to [[Island Records]], it was quickly followed by the announcement that Gregory had left the band, due to lack of enthusiasm, and was replaced by [[Darren Belk]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> For their next album, The Wedding Present again left for the United States and enlisted [[Steve Fisk]] ([[Screaming Trees]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]). The result was ''[[Watusi (album)|Watusi]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album's songs ranged from warm lo-fi pop (\"Gazebo\", \"Big Rat\") to semi-[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[Velvet Underground|Velvets]]-like workouts (\"Click Click\", \"Catwoman\").\n\nNo further albums were recorded for Island, and the best part of 1995 was spent the same way as 1993: touring, writing new material, no recording. Paul Dorrington decided to quit the band; no replacement was made as Belk doubled on bass and guitar. In the autumn of 1995, The Wedding Present released \"Sucker\", a self-financed single that was sold at their gigs only (it has since been included on compilation albums). Shortly after, the band signed with independent label [[Cooking Vinyl]].\n\n===The Cooking Vinyl era (1995-1997/99)===\nThe band, still a three-piece, recorded their newly written material and issued the [[motorcar|car]]-themed six-track mini-album, ''[[Mini (EP)|Mini]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Belk played both guitar and bass on the songs but struggled at the lead instrument. Shortly after releasing the album, [[Jayne Lockey]], who had already sung backing vocals on ''Mini'', was announced as the band's new bass player. Belk decided to quit the band and was replaced by [[Simon Cleave]]. Both Lockey and Cleave were former members of Tse Tse Fly, along with Paul Dorrington and Mark Goodham.\n\nThe band still had material from their sabbatical year and went into the studio again to record ''[[Saturnalia (The Wedding Present album)|Saturnalia]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  This proved to be the last new material by The Wedding Present for a long time. After playing a number of gigs to support the album, the last one in [[Liverpool]] on 18 January 1997, the band took a long sabbatical.\n\n===Contractual obligations and Cinerama (1997-2004)===\n{{main article|Cinerama (band)}}\n\nTo fulfill contractual obligations, two more compilations were released by Cooking Vinyl: another Peel sessions volume, ''[[John Peel Sessions 1992-1995]]'' (1998), and ''[[Singles 1995-1997]]'' (1999). Additionally, Strange Fruit offered another radio sessions compilation, ''[[Evening Sessions 1986-1994]]'' (1997), and the band's American label released ''[[Singles 1989-1991]]'' (1999), a 2CD package which added rarities and live tracks.  Gedge recorded an album, ''Va Va Voom'', in 1998 under the [[Cinerama (band)|Cinerama]] band name with his girlfriend, Sally Murrell, and some session musicians. The project became a full-time band.\n\nFollowing Gedge's split from Murrell in 2003, and with the increasing inclusion on Wedding Present songs in Cinerama's live sets (in previous years Gedge had good-naturedly refused calls from the audience to play Wedding Present songs, frequently replying \"that's another band\" or \"you're at the wrong gig\" ), Gedge effectively renamed Cinerama in 2004, keeping the line up, reflecting the change in sound over the years to the more familiar territory of The Wedding Present.\n\n===Reformation (2004-present)===\n[[File:The Wedding Present-01.jpg|thumb|250px|The Wedding Present in Barcelona in 2010.]]\nNews came in early September 2004 that Cinerama would be rebranded as The Wedding Present. The line-up was to be the same as the last line-up of Cinerama, which included Simon Cleave. The first new single, \"[[Interstate 5 (The Wedding Present song)|Interstate 5]]\", was issued on 15 November 2004, to lead off the new album, ''[[Take Fountain]]'', which was released on 14 February 2005. A second single, \"[[I'm From Further North Than You]]\", was released on 11 April 2005. Third and final single \"[[Ringway to SeaTac]]\" was released on 24 October 2005.\n\nAll singles, their B-sides and acoustic versions from this period were compiled on the 2006 compilation ''[[Search for Paradise: Singles 2004-5]]''. The release came with a bonus DVD compiling the videos for \"Don't Touch That Dial\" (a Cinerama single re-recorded for ''[[Take Fountain]]''), \"Interstate 5\", \"I'm From Further North Than You\", \"Ringway to SeaTac\" and others.\n\nThe Wedding Present toured [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the Spring of 2005 (with John Maiden on drums) and again in Europe towards the end of 2005 (this time, with Simon Pearson on drums). During Christmas 2006, guitarist Simon Cleave left the group and was replaced by the group's sound engineer Chris McConville - who played on the 2006 tours of North America (with Charlie Layton on drums) and Europe (with Graeme Ramsay on drums).\n\nUntil 2009 the line-up remained stable with Gedge, De Castro, McConville, and Ramsay co-writing. They recorded 17 songs with [[Steve Albini]] in January 2008, some of which have been played live at gigs in recent years. Titles include \"I've Lost the Monkey\", \"Soup\", \"Drink You Eat You\", \"Model, Actress, Whatever...\", \"The Thing I Like Most About Him Is His Girlfriend\", \"Twenty Jackies\", \"Swingers\", \"Peek-a-boo\", \"Hulk Loves Betty\", \"Boo Boo\", \"Palisades\", \"Santa Ana Winds\", \"Pinch Pull Twist Release\", \"The Trouble With Men\", \"Don't Take Me Home Until I'm Drunk\" and \"Spider-Man in Hollywood\".\n\nThe album ''[[El Rey (The Wedding Present album)|El Rey]]'' was released on 20 May 2008 in [[North America]] and 26 May 2008 in [[Europe]], accompanied by the [[music download|digital download]]-only single \"The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend\". A compilation of singles and remixes ''How The West Was Won'' was released towards the end of 2008 and accompanied by a single \"Holly Jolly Hollywood\". The Wedding Present also covered [[The Cure]]'s \"High\" for [[American Laundromat Records]] tribute \"Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure\".\n\nSome months before a short tour of the UK and Japan in March 2009, Chris McConville left the band and was replaced by former guitarist Simon Cleave, who left the band again later that year. Graeme Ramsay subsequently moved from drums to guitar and Charles Layton once again became their drummer.\n\nIn 2009 two The Wedding Present songs, \"[[I'm From Further North Than You]]\", and  \"[[Ringway to SeaTac]]\" appeared in the award-winning [[Monty Miranda]] directed independent film ''[[Skills Like This]]''.  The director was praised for his use of music in an integrated soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20skil.html | work=The New York Times | title=20-something Sloth and Larceny | first=Jeannette | last=Catsoulis | date=20 March 2009 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2010 it was announced that De Castro would not be touring with The Wedding Present for the Autumn 21st anniversary tour of ''Bizarro'', and that her last gig would be at 28 August 2010 at Gedge's mini festival \"At the Edge of the Sea\" in Brighton. This marked the end of a 12-year association with Gedge, stretching back to when Cinerama was formed. She was replaced by Pepe le Moko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitones.co.uk/news/ |title=News &#124; The Official home of The Wedding Present and Cinerama |publisher=Scopitones.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>\n[[File:The Wedding Present in Valencia 02.jpg|thumb|David Gedge, singer of The Wedding Present in Valencia, Spain.

The rest of the set was a mixture of songs from ''[[Valentina (The Wedding Present Album)|Valentina]]'' and the back catalogue. In April of the year, The Wedding Present toured Australia for the first time, playing concerts in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nOn 25 October 2012, the ''4 Songs'' Extended Player was released on download only. These four new songs (\"Journey Into Space\", \"Pain Perdu\", \"1000 Fahrenheit\" & \"Can You Keep a Secret\") recorded during the Valentina sessions could be downloaded following the purchase of 'Valentina: The Story of a Wedding Present, a book documenting the making of the long player itself. Valentina itself was re-released in May 2015 after being re-interpreted and re-recorded by David Gedge's other band Cinerama.\n\nIn early 2013 the band started a world tour including taking in the US, Australia and for the first time New Zealand. The Wedding Present played 'George Best' and 'The Hit Parade' in their entirety on this tour celebrating the 25th and 21st 'birthday' of these albums respectively.\n\nThe band released their ninth album, ''[[Going, Going...]]'' on 2 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pearis|first1=Bill|title=The Wedding Present ready new album \u2018Going, Going\u2026\u2019 (listen to two songs)|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-wedding-present-ready-new-album-going-going-listen-to-two-songs/|website=BrooklynVegan|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wedding Present release new album|url=https://www.scopitones.co.uk/archives/6669|website=Scopitones.co.uk|accessdate=12 September 2016|ref=ScopitonesGoing}}</ref>\n\n2017 saw the 30th anniversary of the release of ''[[George Best (album)|George Best]]'', an anniversary tour and a feature-length documentary about the record titled ''The Wedding Present: Something Left Behind''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scopitones.co.uk/archives/7135|title=GEORGE BEST DOCUMENTARY |website=Scopitones.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2019, the band issued a completely re-recorded version of 1988 compilation ''[[Tommy (The Wedding Present album)|Tommy]]'', plus their first picture disc - a 10\" single featuring two new songs.\n\nIn late 2019, the band toured playing [[Bizarro]] in its entirety.  During this tour the band were joined on guitar by Jon Stewart of [[Sleeper (band)|Sleeper]] and Chris Hardwick from [[My Life Story]] on drums.\n\n==Personnel==\n\n===Current===\n\n* David Gedge:
