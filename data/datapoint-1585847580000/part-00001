The ancient scholar and Vedic text commentator Sayana explains the term as a form of \"praise, worship, invocation\". The ''Grhyasutras'' use ''puj'' in the context of rites, as does Sanskrit scholar Panini.

These Sutras, dated to be about 500 BC, use the term puja to describe the hospitality to honor priests who were invited to one\u2019s home to lead rituals for departed ancestors. As with vedic times, the general concept of puja remained the same, but expanded to welcoming the deity along with the deity's spiritual essence as one's honored guest.<ref name=hpr/> The [[Puranas|Puranic]] corpus of literature, dating from about 6th century CE, contain extensive outline on how to perform deity puja (''deva p\u016bj\u0101''). Deity puja thus melds Vedic rites with devotion to deity in its ritual form. As with many others aspects of Hinduism, both Vedic puja and devotional deity puja continued, the choice left to the Hindu.\n\nAs a historical practice, ''p\u016bj\u0101'' in Hinduism, has been modeled around the idea of hosting a deity, or important person, as an honored and dearest guest in the best way one can, given one's resources, and receiving their happiness and blessing in return. [[Paul Thieme]] suggests from passages in the ''[[R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a]]'' that the word ''p\u016bj\u0101'' referred to the hospitable reception of guests and that the things offered to guests could be offered to the gods and their dwellings.<ref>Paul Thieme, \"Indische W\u00f6rter und Sitten,\" in ''Kleine Schriften'' (Wiesbaden, 1984) 2: 343\u201370.</ref> The rituals in question were the \"five great sacrifices\" or ''pa\u00f1camah\u0101yaj\u00f1a'' recorded in the ''G\u1e5bhyas\u016btra'' texts (for this literature, see [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpa]]).<ref>G. B\u00fchnemann, ''P\u016bj\u0101: A Study of Smarta Ritual'' (Vienna, 1988): p. 33; Shingo Einoo, \"The Formation of the P\u016bj\u0101 Ceremony,\" ''Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik (Festschrift f\u00fcr Paul Thieme)'' 20 (1996): 74. A different view is found in Smith, ''Vedic Sacrifice in Transition'', pp. 2\u20135, who attributes the decline of old \u015brauta practices to a number of factors one of which was the emergence of \u2018iconic ritual\u2019.</ref> The development of ''p\u016bj\u0101'' thus emerged from [[Vedic period|Vedic]] domestic traditions and was carried into the temple environment by analogy: just as important guests had long been welcomed in well-to-do homes and offered things that pleased them, so too were the gods welcomed in temple-homes and offered things that pleased them. Copper-plate charters recording grants of lands to temples show that this religious practice was actively encouraged from the mid-4th century.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael D. |last=Willis |authorlink=Michael D.

An example petition prayer made during a Vedic puja, according to Wade Wheelock,<ref name=wtw>Harvey P. Alper, ''Understanding Mantras'', {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, Chapter 3.</ref> is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\n''Indra-Agni, slayers of Vrtra with the beautiful thunderbolt, prosper us with new gifts;''\n''O Indra, bring treasures with your right hand;''\n''O Agni grant the enjoyments of a good household;''\n''Give (us) vigor, wealth in cattle, and possession of good horses.''\n\u2013 \u00c4svS\u00fc\n</poem>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn contrast to Vedic pujas, the significance of deity pujas shifted from petitions and external goals to the experience of oneness with the deities and their spiritual essence. It became a form of [[Yoga]] whose final result aimed to be the consciousness of god through homage to god. Nevertheless, even with this evolved theoretical spiritual significance, for many people, puja continued to be a vehicle to petition desires and appeals, such as for good health of one's child, speedy recovery from illness, success in venture envisioned or such. In the structure and practice of puja, the mantras and rituals focus on spirituality, and any petitions and appeals are tacked only to the end of the puja.<ref name=wtw/>\n\nZimmer<ref>Zimmer, Heinrich (1984), ''Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India''. Translated by Gerald Chapple and James B. Lawson, Princeton University Press.</ref> relates puja to [[yantra]]s, with the rituals helping the devotee focus on the spiritual concepts. Puja in Hinduism, claims Zimmer, is a path and process of transformation of consciousness, where the devotee and the spiritual significance of the deity are brought together. This ritual puja process, in different parts of India, is considered to be liberating, releasing, purifying and a form of Yoga of spirit and emotions.<ref>Hillary Peter Rodrigues (2003), ''Ritual Worship of the Great Goddess'', McGill Studies in the History of Religions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-5399-5}}</ref><ref>Tracy Pintchman (2008), \"Raising Krishna with Love: Maternal devotion as a form of yoga in a women's ritual tradition\", in ''Theory and Practice of Yoga'' (Knut Joacobsen), {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}.</ref>\n\nPuja in Hinduism sometimes involves themes beyond idols or images. Even persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything is seen as manifestations of divine reality by some Hindus. The access to the divine is not limited to renunciatory meditation as in yoga school of Hinduism or idols in bhakti school. For some the divine is everywhere, without limit to its form, and a puja to these manifestations signifies the same spiritual meaning to those who choose to offer a prayer to persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything else.<ref name=dleck>Eck, Diana (1981), ''Dar\u015ban: Seeing the Divine Image in India'', Chambersburg: Anima Books.</ref><ref>Jessica Frazer & Gavin Flood (2011), ''The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}.</ref>\n\n==Temple p\u016bj\u0101==\nTemple (''Mandir'') p\u016bj\u0101 is more elaborate than the domestic versions and typically done several times a day. They are also performed by a temple priest, or ''[[pujari]]''. In addition, the temple deity (patron god or goddess) is considered a resident rather than a guest, so the ''puja'' is modified to reflect that; for example the deity is \"awakened\" rather than \"invoked\" in the morning. Temple ''pujas'' vary widely from region to region and for different sects, with devotional hymns sung at [[Vaishnava]] temples for example. At a temple ''puja'', there is often less active participation, with the priest acting on behalf of others.<ref name=\"Gale\" />\n\n== Structure, services and steps ==\n[[Image:Bhoga.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bhoga to be offered to God for Puja]]\n<!--###############A Female Puja recital Audio Begins#################-->\n{{Listen\n | filename    = Sanskrit chanting for Aarti Puja Prayer - Female Voice.ogg\n | title       = A puja recital\n | description = A prayer chant during Hindu puja.

The foundational work of this school is the ''Karmam\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101s\u016btra'' or \"Aphorisms for Enquiry into the Act,\" composed by [[Jaimini]]. The earliest surviving commentary is by \u015aabara who lived around the end of the fourth century.<ref>Othmar G\u00e4chter, ''Hermeneutics and Language in P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101'' (Delhi, 1983): pp. 9\u201310 where a summary of much scholarship is given.</ref> \u015aabara's commentary, known as ''\u015aabarabh\u0101\u1e63ya'' holds pride of place in M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 in that Sabara's understanding is taken as definitive by all later writers. In his chapter entitled ''Devat\u0101dikara\u1e47a'' (9: 1: 5: 6\u20139), \u015aabara examines the popular understanding of the gods and attempts to refute the belief that they have material bodies, are able to eat the offerings made to them, and are capable of being pleased and so able to reward worshippers.<ref>The case is summarised in M. Willis, ''The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual'' (Cambridge, 2009): pp. 208\u201310.</ref> Basing himself on the [[Vedas]] (he refused to accept the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', ''Pur\u0101\u1e47a'' texts or even the ''Sm\u1e5bti'' literatures as valid sources of authority), \u015aabara concludes that the gods are neither corporeal nor sentient and thus unable to enjoy offerings or own property. For this he appeals to empirical observation, noting that offerings do not decrease in size when given to the gods; any decrease is simply due to exposure to the air. Likewise he argues that substances are offered to gods not according to the wishes of the gods, but that \"what is vouched for by direct perception is that the things are used according to the wishes of the temple servants (''pratyak\u1e63\u0101t pram\u0101\u1e47\u0101t devat\u0101paric\u0101rak\u0101\u1e47\u0101m abhipr\u0101ya\u1e25'').<ref>Willis, ''The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual'' (2009): p. 323, note 208.</ref> In the course of his discussion, \u015aabara's asserts that \"there is no relation between the case of guests and the sacrificial act.\" This incidental remark provides sound historical proof that ''p\u016bj\u0101'' was built on analogy with ''atithi'', the ancient Vedic tradition of welcoming guests. What \u015aabara is maintaining is that this analogy is not valid.<ref>The passage given inWillis, ''The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual'' (2009): p. 210.</ref> While the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas continued to maintain this interpretation for centuries, their defeat in debate at the hands of [[Adi Shankara|\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya]] led to theirs being a minority view. It is a remarkable testament to the plurality and tolerance of Indian civilization that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas flourished even into the 17th century, as evidenced by the commentaries of [[Neelakantha Chaturdhara|N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha]].\n\n==Regional names==\nPuja, sometimes spelled pooja, is called \u09aa\u09c2\u099c\u09be (also spelled as \u09aa\u09c1\u099c\u09cb) in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], \u0baa\u0bc2\u0b9c\u0bc8 in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and bucha (\u0e1a\u0e39\u0e0a\u0e32) in Thai.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal | Hinduism}}\n<!--###############An aarti song, bhajan begins#################-->\n{{Listen\n | filename    =\n | title       = Om jai jagdish hare\n | description = An aarti song (8 minutes 17 seconds)\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n | pos = right\n}}\n<!--###############An aarti song, bhajan ends###################-->\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[A\u00f1jali Mudr\u0101]]\n* [[Buddhist prayer beads]]\n* [[Coconut#Religion|Coconut: use for worship]]\n* [[Culture of India]]\n* [[Dhupa]]\n* [[Guru-shishya tradition]]\n* [[Hindu prayer beads]]\n* [[Hindu temple]]\n* [[Indian honorifics]]\n* [[Garland|Mala]]\n* [[List of Hindu festivals]], many of which involve Puja\n* [[Mudras]]\n* [[Namaste]]\n* [[Panchalinga Darshana]]\n* [[Pran\u0101ma]]\n* [[Puja (Buddhism)]]\n* [[P\u0101dodaka]]\n* [[Satyanarayan Puja]]\n* [[Seven stages (Yogi)|Seven stages of Yoga]]\n* [[The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{sisterlinks|display=Puja|wikt=puja|d=Q10937578|c=Category:Puja|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|s=no|species=no|q=no}}\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

The ancient scholar and Vedic text commentator Sayana explains the term as a form of \"praise, worship, invocation\". The ''Grhyasutras'' use ''puj'' in the context of rites, as does Sanskrit scholar Panini.

These Sutras, dated to be about 500 BC, use the term puja to describe the hospitality to honor priests who were invited to one\u2019s home to lead rituals for departed ancestors. As with vedic times, the general concept of puja remained the same, but expanded to welcoming the deity along with the deity's spiritual essence as one's honored guest.<ref name=hpr/> The [[Puranas|Puranic]] corpus of literature, dating from about 6th century CE, contain extensive outline on how to perform deity puja (''deva p\u016bj\u0101''). Deity puja thus melds Vedic rites with devotion to deity in its ritual form. As with many others aspects of Hinduism, both Vedic puja and devotional deity puja continued, the choice left to the Hindu.\n\nAs a historical practice, ''p\u016bj\u0101'' in Hinduism, has been modeled around the idea of hosting a deity, or important person, as an honored and dearest guest in the best way one can, given one's resources, and receiving their happiness and blessing in return. [[Paul Thieme]] suggests from passages in the ''[[R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a]]'' that the word ''p\u016bj\u0101'' referred to the hospitable reception of guests and that the things offered to guests could be offered to the gods and their dwellings.<ref>Paul Thieme, \"Indische W\u00f6rter und Sitten,\" in ''Kleine Schriften'' (Wiesbaden, 1984) 2: 343\u201370.</ref> The rituals in question were the \"five great sacrifices\" or ''pa\u00f1camah\u0101yaj\u00f1a'' recorded in the ''G\u1e5bhyas\u016btra'' texts (for this literature, see [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpa]]).<ref>G. B\u00fchnemann, ''P\u016bj\u0101: A Study of Smarta Ritual'' (Vienna, 1988): p. 33; Shingo Einoo, \"The Formation of the P\u016bj\u0101 Ceremony,\" ''Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik (Festschrift f\u00fcr Paul Thieme)'' 20 (1996): 74. A different view is found in Smith, ''Vedic Sacrifice in Transition'', pp. 2\u20135, who attributes the decline of old \u015brauta practices to a number of factors one of which was the emergence of \u2018iconic ritual\u2019.</ref> The development of ''p\u016bj\u0101'' thus emerged from [[Vedic period|Vedic]] domestic traditions and was carried into the temple environment by analogy: just as important guests had long been welcomed in well-to-do homes and offered things that pleased them, so too were the gods welcomed in temple-homes and offered things that pleased them. Copper-plate charters recording grants of lands to temples show that this religious practice was actively encouraged from the mid-4th century.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael D. |last=Willis |authorlink=Michael D.

An example petition prayer made during a Vedic puja, according to Wade Wheelock,<ref name=wtw>Harvey P. Alper, ''Understanding Mantras'', {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, Chapter 3.</ref> is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\n''Indra-Agni, slayers of Vrtra with the beautiful thunderbolt, prosper us with new gifts;''\n''O Indra, bring treasures with your right hand;''\n''O Agni grant the enjoyments of a good household;''\n''Give (us) vigor, wealth in cattle, and possession of good horses.''\n\u2013 \u00c4svS\u00fc\n</poem>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn contrast to Vedic pujas, the significance of deity pujas shifted from petitions and external goals to the experience of oneness with the deities and their spiritual essence. It became a form of [[Yoga]] whose final result aimed to be the consciousness of god through homage to god. Nevertheless, even with this evolved theoretical spiritual significance, for many people, puja continued to be a vehicle to petition desires and appeals, such as for good health of one's child, speedy recovery from illness, success in venture envisioned or such. In the structure and practice of puja, the mantras and rituals focus on spirituality, and any petitions and appeals are tacked only to the end of the puja.<ref name=wtw/>\n\nZimmer<ref>Zimmer, Heinrich (1984), ''Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India''. Translated by Gerald Chapple and James B. Lawson, Princeton University Press.</ref> relates puja to [[yantra]]s, with the rituals helping the devotee focus on the spiritual concepts. Puja in Hinduism, claims Zimmer, is a path and process of transformation of consciousness, where the devotee and the spiritual significance of the deity are brought together. This ritual puja process, in different parts of India, is considered to be liberating, releasing, purifying and a form of Yoga of spirit and emotions.<ref>Hillary Peter Rodrigues (2003), ''Ritual Worship of the Great Goddess'', McGill Studies in the History of Religions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-5399-5}}</ref><ref>Tracy Pintchman (2008), \"Raising Krishna with Love: Maternal devotion as a form of yoga in a women's ritual tradition\", in ''Theory and Practice of Yoga'' (Knut Joacobsen), {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}.</ref>\n\nPuja in Hinduism sometimes involves themes beyond idols or images. Even persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything is seen as manifestations of divine reality by some Hindus. The access to the divine is not limited to renunciatory meditation as in yoga school of Hinduism or idols in bhakti school. For some the divine is everywhere, without limit to its form, and a puja to these manifestations signifies the same spiritual meaning to those who choose to offer a prayer to persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything else.<ref name=dleck>Eck, Diana (1981), ''Dar\u015ban: Seeing the Divine Image in India'', Chambersburg: Anima Books.</ref><ref>Jessica Frazer & Gavin Flood (2011), ''The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}.</ref>\n\n==Temple p\u016bj\u0101==\nTemple (''Mandir'') p\u016bj\u0101 is more elaborate than the domestic versions and typically done several times a day. They are also performed by a temple priest, or ''[[pujari]]''. In addition, the temple deity (patron god or goddess) is considered a resident rather than a guest, so the ''puja'' is modified to reflect that; for example the deity is \"awakened\" rather than \"invoked\" in the morning. Temple ''pujas'' vary widely from region to region and for different sects, with devotional hymns sung at [[Vaishnava]] temples for example.

In this example, the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, hymns and food are offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave and with affection expresses good bye to the deity.<ref name=\"Gale\" /> [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Jan Gonda]] has identified 16 steps (shodasha upachara) that are common in all varieties of puja:<ref>{{Citation|last=Fuller|first=C.

First the deity is greeted, acknowledged by name and welcomed, sometimes with a ''diya'' or lighted incense stick. The devotee proceeds to connect with the spiritual manifestation by meditating (a form of ''darshan''), or chanting hymns and mantras, then personal prayers follow. After prayer is finished, the spiritual visitor as guest is affectionately thanked and greeted goodbye.<ref name=dleck/> A quick meditative puja is sometimes offered by some Hindus without an idol or image. According to [[Chris Fuller (academic)|Chris Fuller]], an anthropologist, Hindu texts allow flexibility and abbreviated puja according to occasion, needs and personal preferences.<ref>Christopher Fuller (1992), ''The Camphor Flame \u2013 Popular Hinduism and Society in India'', Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\n== In Balinese Hinduism ==\n[[File:Balinese Hindu Puja Offerings, Ubud Bali Indonesia 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|Puja offerings to Ganesha in [[Ubud]], [[Bali]], Indonesia.]]\nIn Hinduism of [[Bali]] Indonesia, puja is sometimes called ''Sembahyang''.<ref name=yb/><ref name=tbt>[http://www.thebalitimes.com/2008/01/04/how-balinese-worship-their-god/ \"How Balinese Worship their God\"], ''The Bali Times'' (January 4, 2008)\n* [http://www.babadbali.com/canangsari/sembahyang-pedoman.htm Pedoman Sembahyang] Bali Indonesia (2009).</ref> The word originates from two words in old Javanese: sembah and hyang. Sembah means to respect and bow down; [[Hyang]] means divine, God or [[Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa]], holy man, and ancestors. So to pray means to respect, bow down, surrender to the divine and ancestors.\n\nSembahyang (Puja) is an obligation for Balinese Hindus, the prayers and hymns are derived from the Vedas. A family typically offers prayers every day, with ''Kewangen'' and other offerings. Kewangen means aromatic, and it is made from leaves and flowers in form of auspicious Vedic symbols. Balinese use kewangen to worship the divine, both in form of Purusha (soul) and Pradana (body). As with India, Balinese make offerings, including symbolic inclusion of fire, incense and [[mantra]]s.<ref name=tbt/><ref>Rajiv Malik, [http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5267 \"Bali \u2013 Land of Offerings\"], ''Hinduism Today'' (2011).</ref>\n\n== Guru puja ==\nIn the case of great spiritual masters, there is also a custom to perform puja for a living person especially in [[Guru Purnima]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.com/festivals-events/guru-purnima-2019-know-the-importance-significance-puja-tithi-celebrations-of-the-day-of-gurus-3716084/|title=Guru Purnima 2019: Know The Importance, Significance, Puja Tithi, Celebrations of The Day of 'Gurus'|last=Desk|first=India com Buzz|date=2019-07-13|website=India.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref> Gurus are sometimes chosen as objects of puja and honored as living gods or seen as the embodiment of specific deities. Gurus are sometimes adorned with symbolic clothes, garlands and other ornaments, and celebrated with incense, washing and anointing their feet, giving them fruits, food and drinks and meditating at their feet, asking for their blessing.\n\n== As a social and human rights event ==\nAs with church services in Christianity, P\u016bj\u0101 in Hinduism has served as a means for Hindu communities outside India to gather, socialize, discover new friends and sometimes discuss ways to address social discrimination of Hindus.<ref>I.

These Hindu rituals were considered pagan and uncivilized. Pujas offered a way for Hindus to meet, socially organize and petition their human rights.

The foundational work of this school is the ''Karmam\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101s\u016btra'' or \"Aphorisms for Enquiry into the Act,\" composed by [[Jaimini]]. The earliest surviving commentary is by \u015aabara who lived around the end of the fourth century.<ref>Othmar G\u00e4chter, ''Hermeneutics and Language in P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101'' (Delhi, 1983): pp. 9\u201310 where a summary of much scholarship is given.</ref> \u015aabara's commentary, known as ''\u015aabarabh\u0101\u1e63ya'' holds pride of place in M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 in that Sabara's understanding is taken as definitive by all later writers. In his chapter entitled ''Devat\u0101dikara\u1e47a'' (9: 1: 5: 6\u20139), \u015aabara examines the popular understanding of the gods and attempts to refute the belief that they have material bodies, are able to eat the offerings made to them, and are capable of being pleased and so able to reward worshippers.<ref>The case is summarised in M. Willis, ''The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual'' (Cambridge, 2009): pp. 208\u201310.</ref> Basing himself on the [[Vedas]] (he refused to accept the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', ''Pur\u0101\u1e47a'' texts or even the ''Sm\u1e5bti'' literatures as valid sources of authority), \u015aabara concludes that the gods are neither corporeal nor sentient and thus unable to enjoy offerings or own property. For this he appeals to empirical observation, noting that offerings do not decrease in size when given to the gods; any decrease is simply due to exposure to the air. Likewise he argues that substances are offered to gods not according to the wishes of the gods, but that \"what is vouched for by direct perception is that the things are used according to the wishes of the temple servants (''pratyak\u1e63\u0101t pram\u0101\u1e47\u0101t devat\u0101paric\u0101rak\u0101\u1e47\u0101m abhipr\u0101ya\u1e25'').<ref>Willis, ''The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual'' (2009): p. 323, note 208.</ref> In the course of his discussion, \u015aabara's asserts that \"there is no relation between the case of guests and the sacrificial act.\" This incidental remark provides sound historical proof that ''p\u016bj\u0101'' was built on analogy with ''atithi'', the ancient Vedic tradition of welcoming guests. What \u015aabara is maintaining is that this analogy is not valid.<ref>The passage given inWillis, ''The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual'' (2009): p. 210.</ref> While the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas continued to maintain this interpretation for centuries, their defeat in debate at the hands of [[Adi Shankara|\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya]] led to theirs being a minority view. It is a remarkable testament to the plurality and tolerance of Indian civilization that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas flourished even into the 17th century, as evidenced by the commentaries of [[Neelakantha Chaturdhara|N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha]].\n\n==Regional names==\nPuja, sometimes spelled pooja, is called \u09aa\u09c2\u099c\u09be (also spelled as \u09aa\u09c1\u099c\u09cb) in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], \u0baa\u0bc2\u0b9c\u0bc8 in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and bucha (\u0e1a\u0e39\u0e0a\u0e32) in Thai.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal | Hinduism}}\n<!--###############An aarti song, bhajan begins#################-->\n{{Listen\n | filename    =\n | title       = Om jai jagdish hare\n | description = An aarti song (8 minutes 17 seconds)\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n | pos = right\n}}\n<!--###############An aarti song, bhajan ends###################-->\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[A\u00f1jali Mudr\u0101]]\n* [[Buddhist prayer beads]]\n* [[Coconut#Religion|Coconut: use for worship]]\n* [[Culture of India]]\n* [[Dhupa]]\n* [[Guru-shishya tradition]]\n* [[Hindu prayer beads]]\n* [[Hindu temple]]\n* [[Indian honorifics]]\n* [[Garland|Mala]]\n* [[List of Hindu festivals]], many of which involve Puja\n* [[Mudras]]\n* [[Namaste]]\n* [[Panchalinga Darshana]]\n* [[Pran\u0101ma]]\n* [[Puja (Buddhism)]]\n* [[P\u0101dodaka]]\n* [[Satyanarayan Puja]]\n* [[Seven stages (Yogi)|Seven stages of Yoga]]\n* [[The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{sisterlinks|display=Puja|wikt=puja|d=Q10937578|c=Category:Puja|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|s=no|species=no|q=no}}\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
