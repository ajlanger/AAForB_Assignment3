Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from [[coal]] stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage. This liquid often contains toxic metals, such as copper or iron. These, combined with reduced pH, have a detrimental impact on the streams aquatic environments.\n\nThe same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of [[acid sulfate soil]]s formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar [[environmental hazard]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nHistorically, the acidic discharges from active or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term acid rock drainage, or ARD, was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines.<ref>Dowding, B. & Mills, C,: ''[http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/ard/Introduction/Natural.htm Natural acid rock drainage and its impact upon background metal concentrations]'', [http://www.infomine.com/ InfoMine.com]. Accessed 23 September 2013.</ref> For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: \"The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database\"<ref>Ferguson, K.D. and Morin, K.A. The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database. ''Proceedings: Second International Conference on the Abatement of Acidic Drainage.'' Sept 16 to 18, 1991, Montreal, Quebec.</ref> Both AMD and ARD refer to low [[pH]] or acidic waters caused by the oxidation of [[sulfide minerals]], though ARD is the more generic name.\n\nIn cases where drainage from a mine is not acidic and has dissolved metals or [[metalloid]]s, or was originally acidic, but has been neutralized along its flow path, then it is described as \"neutral mine drainage\",<ref name=\"GARD\">[http://www.gardguide.com/index.php/Main_Page Global Acid Rock Drainage Guide (GARD Guide)] INAP: The International Network for Acid Prevention.

This break down is the main driver of acid mine drainage.]]\n[[Sub-surface mining]] often progresses below the [[water table]], so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations. [[Tailings]] piles or ponds, [[mine waste rock dumps]],<ref name=\"GARD\" /> and [[Spoil tip|coal spoils]] are also an important source of acid mine drainage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Raul E.|last2=Ho\u00e0ng|first2=Thi B\u00edch H\u00f2a|last3=Weber|first3=Sebastian|last4=Faucon|first4=Michel-Pierre|last5=Pourret|first5=Olivier|last6=Marquez|first6=J.

These microbes, called [[extremophile]]s for their ability to survive in harsh conditions, occur naturally in the rock, but limited water and [[oxygen]] supplies usually keep their numbers low.

Acidic water produced at active mines must be neutralized to achieve pH 6-9 before discharge from a mine site to a stream is permitted.\n\nIn Canada, work to reduce the effects of acid mine drainage is concentrated under the Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) program.

In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a [[clarifier]]. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors.<ref>Zinck, J.M. and Griffith, W.F. 2000. An assessment of HDS-type lime treatment processes \u2013 efficiency and environmental impact. In: ICARD 2000. Proceedings from the Fifth International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage. Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc. Vol II, 1027-1034</ref> Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain [[gypsum]] ([[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]]) and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization. A general equation for this process is:\n\n:H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] -> [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O\nor more precisely in [[aqueous solution]]:\n:SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup>  +  [[Calcium oxide|Ca<sup>2+</sup>+O<sup>2&minus;</sup>]]<small>(aq)</small> -> Ca<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup><small>(aq)</small> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2&minus;</sup> <small>(aq)</small>\n\nLess complex variants of this process, such as simple lime neutralization, may involve no more than a lime silo, mixing tank and settling pond. These systems are far less costly to build, but are also less efficient (i.e., longer reaction times are required, and they produce a discharge with higher trace metal concentrations, if present). They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|title=Overview of Acid Mine Drainage Treatment with Chemicals|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524070234/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|archive-date=24 May 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Calcium silicate neutralization====\nA calcium silicate feedstock, made from processed steel slag, can also be used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H<sup>+</sup> ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H<sup>+</sup> cations in the soil solution.<ref name=\"steel slag\">{{cite web|last=Ziemkiewicz |first=Paul |title=The Use of Steel Slag in Acid Mine Drainage Treatment and Control |url=http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720064631/http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of calcium silicate to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.<ref>''Calcium Silicon-Based Mineral CSA.'' Harsco Minerals.</ref>\n\nIn the presence of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hammarstrom|first=Jane M.|author2=Philip L.

These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.<ref name=\"steel slag\"/>\n\n====Carbonate neutralization====\nGenerally, [[limestone]] or other [[Calcium|calcareous]] [[Stratum|strata]] that could neutralize acid are lacking or deficient at sites that produce acidic rock drainage. Limestone chips may be introduced into sites to create a neutralizing effect. Where limestone has been used, such as at [[Cwm Rheidol]] in mid [[Wales]], the positive impact has been much less than anticipated because of the creation of an insoluble [[calcium sulfate]] layer on the limestone chips, binding the material and preventing further neutralization.\n\n====Ion exchange====\n[[Ion exchange|Cation exchange]] processes have previously been investigated as a potential treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from [[mine water]].<ref>M. Botha, L. Bester, E. Hardwick \"Removal of Uranium from Mine Water Using Ion Exchange at Driefontein Mine\"</ref> Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form.

The latter results from sediment-borne anaerobic bacteria capable of reverting sulfate ions into sulfide ions. These sulfide ions can then bind with heavy metal ions, precipitating heavy metals out of solution and effectively reversing the entire process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe attractiveness of a constructed wetlands solution lies in its relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine [[constructed wetland]]) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it is very important that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.\n\nAn example of an effective constructed wetland is on the [[Afon Pelena]] in the [[River Afan]] valley above [[Port Talbot]] where highly ferruginous discharges from the [[Whitworth mine]] have been successfully treated.\n\n====Precipitation of metal sulfides====\nMost base metals in acidic solution precipitate in contact with free sulfide, e.g. from H<sub>2</sub>S or NaHS. Solid-liquid separation after reaction would produce a base metal-free effluent that can be discharged or further treated to reduce sulfate, and a metal sulfide concentrate with possible economic value.\n\nAs an alternative, several researchers have investigated the precipitation of metals using biogenic sulfide. In this process, [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]] oxidize organic matter using sulfate, instead of oxygen.

Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from [[coal]] stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage. This liquid often contains toxic metals, such as copper or iron. These, combined with reduced pH, have a detrimental impact on the streams aquatic environments.\n\nThe same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of [[acid sulfate soil]]s formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar [[environmental hazard]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nHistorically, the acidic discharges from active or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term acid rock drainage, or ARD, was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines.<ref>Dowding, B. & Mills, C,: ''[http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/ard/Introduction/Natural.htm Natural acid rock drainage and its impact upon background metal concentrations]'', [http://www.infomine.com/ InfoMine.com]. Accessed 23 September 2013.</ref> For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: \"The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database\"<ref>Ferguson, K.D. and Morin, K.A. The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database. ''Proceedings: Second International Conference on the Abatement of Acidic Drainage.'' Sept 16 to 18, 1991, Montreal, Quebec.</ref> Both AMD and ARD refer to low [[pH]] or acidic waters caused by the oxidation of [[sulfide minerals]], though ARD is the more generic name.\n\nIn cases where drainage from a mine is not acidic and has dissolved metals or [[metalloid]]s, or was originally acidic, but has been neutralized along its flow path, then it is described as \"neutral mine drainage\",<ref name=\"GARD\">[http://www.gardguide.com/index.php/Main_Page Global Acid Rock Drainage Guide (GARD Guide)] INAP: The International Network for Acid Prevention.

This break down is the main driver of acid mine drainage.]]\n[[Sub-surface mining]] often progresses below the [[water table]], so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations. [[Tailings]] piles or ponds, [[mine waste rock dumps]],<ref name=\"GARD\" /> and [[Spoil tip|coal spoils]] are also an important source of acid mine drainage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Raul E.|last2=Ho\u00e0ng|first2=Thi B\u00edch H\u00f2a|last3=Weber|first3=Sebastian|last4=Faucon|first4=Michel-Pierre|last5=Pourret|first5=Olivier|last6=Marquez|first6=J.

These microbes, called [[extremophile]]s for their ability to survive in harsh conditions, occur naturally in the rock, but limited water and [[oxygen]] supplies usually keep their numbers low.

The elevated levels of heavy metals can only be dissolved in waters that have a low pH, as is found in the acidic waters produced by pyrite oxidation. In the coal belt around the south [[Wales]] valleys in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] highly acidic nickel-rich discharges from coal stocking sites have proved to be particularly troublesome.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== Effects on aquatic wildlife ===\nAcid mine drainage also affects the wildlife living within the affected body of water.

In such cases the [[Environment Agency]] working with partners such as the [[Coal Authority]] have provided some innovative solutions, including [[constructed wetland]] solutions such as on the [[River Pelenna]] in the valley of the [[River Afan]] near [[Port Talbot]] and the constructed wetland next to the River Neath at Ynysarwed.\n\nAlthough abandoned underground mines produce most of the acid mine drainage, some recently mined and reclaimed surface mines have produced ARD and have degraded local ground-water and surface-water resources. Acidic water produced at active mines must be neutralized to achieve pH 6-9 before discharge from a mine site to a stream is permitted.\n\nIn Canada, work to reduce the effects of acid mine drainage is concentrated under the Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) program. Total liability from acid rock drainage is estimated to be between $2 billion and $5 billion CAD.<ref>[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/enviro/effluents/effspecserv-e.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423224403/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/enviro/effluents/effspecserv-e.htm|date=23 April 2008}}</ref>  Over a period of eight years, MEND claims to have reduced ARD liability by up to $400 million CAD, from an investment of $17.5 million CAD.<ref>[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/mend/default_e.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604053644/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/mend/default_e.htm|date=4 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Methods===\n\n====Lime neutralization====\nBy far, the most commonly used commercial process for treating acid mine drainage is [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[Calcium oxide|CaO]]) precipitation in a high-density sludge (HDS) process. In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a [[clarifier]]. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors.<ref>Zinck, J.M. and Griffith, W.F. 2000. An assessment of HDS-type lime treatment processes \u2013 efficiency and environmental impact. In: ICARD 2000. Proceedings from the Fifth International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage. Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc. Vol II, 1027-1034</ref> Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain [[gypsum]] ([[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]]) and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization. A general equation for this process is:\n\n:H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] -> [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O\nor more precisely in [[aqueous solution]]:\n:SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup>  +  [[Calcium oxide|Ca<sup>2+</sup>+O<sup>2&minus;</sup>]]<small>(aq)</small> -> Ca<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup><small>(aq)</small> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2&minus;</sup> <small>(aq)</small>\n\nLess complex variants of this process, such as simple lime neutralization, may involve no more than a lime silo, mixing tank and settling pond. These systems are far less costly to build, but are also less efficient (i.e., longer reaction times are required, and they produce a discharge with higher trace metal concentrations, if present). They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|title=Overview of Acid Mine Drainage Treatment with Chemicals|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524070234/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|archive-date=24 May 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Calcium silicate neutralization====\nA calcium silicate feedstock, made from processed steel slag, can also be used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H<sup>+</sup> ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H<sup>+</sup> cations in the soil solution.<ref name=\"steel slag\">{{cite web|last=Ziemkiewicz |first=Paul |title=The Use of Steel Slag in Acid Mine Drainage Treatment and Control |url=http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720064631/http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of calcium silicate to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.<ref>''Calcium Silicon-Based Mineral CSA.'' Harsco Minerals.</ref>\n\nIn the presence of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hammarstrom|first=Jane M.|author2=Philip L.

These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.<ref name=\"steel slag\"/>\n\n====Carbonate neutralization====\nGenerally, [[limestone]] or other [[Calcium|calcareous]] [[Stratum|strata]] that could neutralize acid are lacking or deficient at sites that produce acidic rock drainage. Limestone chips may be introduced into sites to create a neutralizing effect. Where limestone has been used, such as at [[Cwm Rheidol]] in mid [[Wales]], the positive impact has been much less than anticipated because of the creation of an insoluble [[calcium sulfate]] layer on the limestone chips, binding the material and preventing further neutralization.\n\n====Ion exchange====\n[[Ion exchange|Cation exchange]] processes have previously been investigated as a potential treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from [[mine water]].<ref>M. Botha, L. Bester, E. Hardwick \"Removal of Uranium from Mine Water Using Ion Exchange at Driefontein Mine\"</ref> Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.\n\n====Constructed wetlands====\n[[Constructed wetland]]s systems have been proposed during the 1980s to treat acid mine drainage generated by the abandoned coal mines in Eastern Appalachia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/wetlands/coal.htm |title=Constructed wetlands for treatment of mine drainage - Coal-generated AMD |author= Andr\u00e9 Sobolewski |publisher=Wetlands for the Treatment of Mine Drainage |accessdate=2010-12-12 }}</ref>  Generally, the wetlands receive near-neutral water, after it has been neutralized by (typically) a limestone-based treatment process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/passtrt/passtrt.htm|title=Overview of Passive Systems for Treating Acid Mine Drainage|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906074838/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/passtrt/passtrt.htm|archive-date=6 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Metal precipitation occurs from their oxidation at near-neutral pH, complexation with organic matter, precipitation as carbonates or sulfides. The latter results from sediment-borne anaerobic bacteria capable of reverting sulfate ions into sulfide ions. These sulfide ions can then bind with heavy metal ions, precipitating heavy metals out of solution and effectively reversing the entire process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe attractiveness of a constructed wetlands solution lies in its relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine [[constructed wetland]]) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it is very important that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.\n\nAn example of an effective constructed wetland is on the [[Afon Pelena]] in the [[River Afan]] valley above [[Port Talbot]] where highly ferruginous discharges from the [[Whitworth mine]] have been successfully treated.\n\n====Precipitation of metal sulfides====\nMost base metals in acidic solution precipitate in contact with free sulfide, e.g. from H<sub>2</sub>S or NaHS. Solid-liquid separation after reaction would produce a base metal-free effluent that can be discharged or further treated to reduce sulfate, and a metal sulfide concentrate with possible economic value.\n\nAs an alternative, several researchers have investigated the precipitation of metals using biogenic sulfide. In this process, [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]] oxidize organic matter using sulfate, instead of oxygen. Their metabolic products include [[bicarbonate]], which can neutralize water acidity, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], which forms highly insoluble precipitates with many toxic metals. Although promising, this process has been slow in being adopted for a variety of technical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Operational Lessons Learned During Bioreactor Demonstrations for Acid Rock Drainage Treatment|first1=Diana|last1=Bless|first2=Brian|last2=Park|first3=Suzzann|last3=Nordwick|first4=Marek|last4=Zaluski|first5=Helen|last5=Joyce|first6=Randy|last6=Hiebert|first7=Charles|last7=Clavelot|date=1 December 2008|journal=Mine Water and the Environment|volume=27|issue=4|pages=241\u2013250|doi=10.1007/s10230-008-0052-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Technologies ===\nMany technologies exist for the treatment of AMD from traditional high cost water treatment plants to simple [[in situ water treatment]] reagent dosing methods.\n\n== Metagenomic study ==\n\nWith the advance of [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|large-scale sequencing strategies]], [[genome]]s of microorganisms in the acid mine drainage community are directly sequenced from the environment.
