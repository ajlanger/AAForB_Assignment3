Additionally, many personalities who are active in [[Bollywood]], [[cricket]], and [[politics]] reside in the suburb.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Bandra\" possibly originates from the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] word for port, or \"bandar.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/a-tour-through-mumbai-s-historical-neighbourhoods/|title=A Tour Through Mumbai's Historical Neighbourhoods}}</ref> It is described by [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]]'s ''A Dictionary, Hindustani and English'''(1848) as \"a city; an emporium; a port, harbor; a trading town to which numbers of foreign merchants resort\".<ref name=\"Forbes1848\">{{cite book|author=Duncan Forbes|title=A Dictionary, Hindustani and English: To which is Added a Reversed Part, English and Hindustani|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7klIAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1848|publisher=W.H. Allen}}</ref> In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], Bandra is known as ''Vandre'', which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word.\n\nThe area was under the rule of the [[Silhara dynasty]] in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by [[Kolis]] (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]].\n\n===Portuguese Bandra===\nIn 1534, a sea captain, [[Diego da Silveira]], entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the [[Portuguese crown]].\n\nThis turmoil was the start of a long period of [[Christianization]] of Bandra. Father [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Manuel Gomes]], a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \"invincible strength of soul\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]].\n\nBandra became a Portuguese possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig ''Sao Mateus'' in [[Vasai|Ba\u00e7aim]] harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor-General [[Nuno da Cunha]] and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese [[enfeoffed]] (gave) Bandra, [[Kurla]], [[Mazagaon|Mazgaon]] and four other villages in 1548 to [[Ant\u00f3nio Pessoa]] as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.\n\nAs these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.firstpost.com/blogs/have-bandras-xenophobes-forgotten-their-own-history-238786.html\n|title=Have Bandra's xenophobes forgotten their own history?\n|publisher=[[First Post]]\n|date = 9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] was given to [[England]] as part of the dowry.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461\n|title=Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a (1638\u20131705)\n|publisher=BBC\n}}</ref> However, [[Salsette Island]], on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=174|Ref=bom}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]] in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches\u2014[[Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra|Mount Carmel]], St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi\u2014that lie within an area of four square kilometres.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mumbai-once-a-part-of-bandras-catholic-heritage-a-chapel-at-pali-hill-will-soon-be-history-1824997\n|title=Mumbai: Once a part of Bandra's Catholic heritage, a chapel at Pali Hill will soon be history\n|publisher=[[DNA India]]\n|date = 21 April 2013\n}}</ref> \n\n===British Bandra===\nBandra became part of English territory with the signing of the [[Treaty of Surat]] in 1775, but was retroceded to the [[Marathas]] in 1779 during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. In 1802, [[Bajirao II]] signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.\n\nOn 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between [[Virar]] and Bombay. Six years later, it was increased to 24 each day. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from [[Pali Naka]], [[Hill Road]] to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After [[World War II]], the building boom began to accommodate immigrants.\n\nBandra was raised to the status of a [[Bandra Municipal Committee|municipality]] in 1876 and then was expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Pali, and Chuim. These have been lost to urban development of the island.\n\n====Mount Mary's Church====\n[[File:Mother mary.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mother Mary at [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra]].]]\nThe Catholic [[chapel]] of [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra|Mount Mary]] was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The chapel was destroyed in 1738 by the Marathas during their campaign to evict the Portuguese. The statue of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St. Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761. 2018 marked the beginning of the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\", also known as the \"Monti Fest\" or the \"Bandra Feast\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect [[Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy]]. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the [[Castella de Aguada]] (Fortress of Aguada) at [[Land's End, Bandra]]. In 1879, [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]] constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the ''Degrados de Bomanjee'' ('Steps of Bomanjee').\n\nPeople of all faiths and communities visit the church, giving the place a syncretic nature. The [[Bandra Fair]] is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when pilgrims throng the church.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=255163 Mount Mary fair begins today]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 8 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_devotees-throng-to-bandra-fair-on-opening-day-as-stall-owners-protest_1437121 \"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\"], ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 13 September 2010.</ref>\n\n====Educational institutions====\nThe first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr. [[Francisco de Melo]] in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish. This later became [[St. Andrew's High School, Mumbai|St. Andrew's High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://saintandrewschoolbandra.in/content/history-0|publisher=St Andrew High School, Bandra|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331133206/http://saintandrewschoolbandra.in/content/history-0|archive-date=31 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The school is located in Bandra West.\n\nSt. Theresa's High School grew out of St. Andrew's Indian Christians' School, housed in a very dilapidated building situated in Old Khar.

Later, it grew to be a full-fledged educational institution for day-scholars as well as boarders. What started out as a school for 40 orphans has grown to support 2,300 students. St. Stanislaus High School is located on Hill Road, in Bandra West. [[Cardinal Gracias High School]] is a [[convent school]] located in Bandra East.

National College]] was originally set up in 1922 in [[Hyderabad, Pakistan]] under the guidance of [[Annie Besant]]. In the run-up to the [[Partition of India]], it was relocated to its present site in 1949 in Bandra. The [[Thadomal Shahani Engineering College]] was established in 1983 by the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]]. It was the first private engineering institute to be affiliated with the federal [[University of Mumbai]] to offer courses in [[Computer Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]].\n\nThe Rizvi Education Complex, located off [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]], comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); [[Rizvi College of Engineering]] (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management & Catering Technology; [[Rizvi Law College]]; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing & Creative Arts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rizvi.edu.in/|title=Rizvi Education Society|author=|date=|website=www.rizvi.edu.in}}</ref> All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution.\n\n====Bandra lake====\n{{main|Bandra Talao}}\n[[Bandra Lake]], also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir was constructed by a rich [[Konkani]] Muslim of [[Navapada]] (also spelt Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |title=Gazetteer of Thane District \u2013 Places of Interest, 1882| url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-III/places_Bandra.html}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was later acquired by the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]]. It was officially renamed [[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekanand]] Sarovar.

In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the [[Mithi River]] in the eastern portion of the city, near the [[Kurla]] border. The newly-formed [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.\n\nAs the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between [[Banda Station|Bandra]] and [[Kurla railway station|Kurla]] stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made [[Banda Station|Bandra]] among the busiest stations in India, surpassing [[Andheri]] and [[Bombay Central]], and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after [[Churchgate railway station]].\n\n==Urban art==\nBandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-ranwar-village.html|title=Ranwar Village|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-bollywood-art-project.html|title=Bollywood Art Project|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref> They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.\nSt+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BollywoodArtProject/|title=Bollywood Art Project \u2013 BAP|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists.

The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director [[Mehboob Khan]] established the [[Mehboob Studio]]s here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, [[Bollywood]]. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.<ref name=pn>{{cite news |title=Mehboob mere, Mehboob tere |url=http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |newspaper=Pune Mirror |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718051651/http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=dn>{{cite news |title=Mumbai, meri mehboob?|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/column_mumbai-meri-mehboob_1504231 |newspaper=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=  7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, [[Bandra-Kurla complex|Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex]], the office of the state housing development authority ([[Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority|MHADA]]) and the office of the [[District Collector]]. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.\n\nMost roads and places in Bandra were given English names during [[British rule]]. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.\n\n* Neighbouring suburbs: [[Dharavi]], [[Khar, Mumbai|Khar]], [[Kurla]], [[Mahim]], [[Santa Cruz (Mumbai)|Santacruz]]\n* Arterial Roads: [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] (S.V Road), [[Linking Road]], Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), [[Hill Road]] (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]] (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), [[Western Express Highway]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] connects the western part of Bandra to [[Worli]] by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic.\n\n[[File:Worli skyline from Bandra.jpg|thumb|300px|Worli skyline as seen from Bandra Reclamation]]\n[[File:Bandra Linking road.jpg|thumb|A stall on Linking Road]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:India Mumbai Bridge .jpg|thumb|[[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] Project]]\n[[Bandra railway station]] is connected with the [[Western Railway Zone (India)|Western Railway]] and the [[Harbour Line]], which is an offshoot of the suburban [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]].

The important trains include the Bandra-[[New Delhi]] Rajdhani Express, Bandra-[[Indore]] Express, Bandra-[[Patna]] Express, Bandra-[[Jaipur]] Express, Bandra-[[Jodhpur]] Express and the Bandra-[[Amritsar]] Express\n\nPublic transport also includes [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering [[Mahim]], only taxis are allowed to ply.\n\nThe [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] bridge connects Bandra West with [[Worli]], located in central Mumbai.

Allen}}</ref> In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], Bandra is known as ''Vandre'', which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word.\n\nThe area was under the rule of the [[Silhara dynasty]] in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by [[Kolis]] (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]].\n\n===Portuguese Bandra===\nIn 1534, a sea captain, [[Diego da Silveira]], entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the [[Portuguese crown]].\n\nThis turmoil was the start of a long period of [[Christianization]] of Bandra. Father [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Manuel Gomes]], a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \"invincible strength of soul\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]].\n\nBandra became a Portuguese possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig ''Sao Mateus'' in [[Vasai|Ba\u00e7aim]] harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor-General [[Nuno da Cunha]] and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese [[enfeoffed]] (gave) Bandra, [[Kurla]], [[Mazagaon|Mazgaon]] and four other villages in 1548 to [[Ant\u00f3nio Pessoa]] as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.\n\nAs these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.firstpost.com/blogs/have-bandras-xenophobes-forgotten-their-own-history-238786.html\n|title=Have Bandra's xenophobes forgotten their own history?\n|publisher=[[First Post]]\n|date = 9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] was given to [[England]] as part of the dowry.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461\n|title=Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a (1638\u20131705)\n|publisher=BBC\n}}</ref> However, [[Salsette Island]], on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=174|Ref=bom}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being St. Andrew's Church in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches\u2014[[Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra|Mount Carmel]], St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi\u2014that lie within an area of four square kilometres.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mumbai-once-a-part-of-bandras-catholic-heritage-a-chapel-at-pali-hill-will-soon-be-history-1824997\n|title=Mumbai: Once a part of Bandra's Catholic heritage, a chapel at Pali Hill will soon be history\n|publisher=[[DNA India]]\n|date = 21 April 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===British Bandra===\nBandra became part of English territory with the signing of the [[Treaty of Surat]] in 1775, but was retroceded to the [[Marathas]] in 1779 during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. In 1802, [[Bajirao II]] signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.\n\nOn 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between [[Virar]] and Bombay. Six years later, it was increased to 24 each day. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from [[Pali Naka]], [[Hill Road]] to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After [[World War II]], the building boom began to accommodate immigrants.\n\nBandra was raised to the status of a [[Bandra Municipal Committee|municipality]] in 1876 and then was expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Pali, and Chuim. These have been lost to urban development of the island.\n\n====Mount Mary's Church====\n[[File:Mother mary.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mother Mary at [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra]].]]\nThe Catholic [[chapel]] of [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra|Mount Mary]] was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The chapel was destroyed in 1738 by the Marathas during their campaign to evict the Portuguese. The statue of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St. Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761. 2018 marked the beginning of the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\", also known as the \"Monti Fest\" or the \"Bandra Feast\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect [[Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy]]. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the [[Castella de Aguada]] (Fortress of Aguada) at [[Land's End, Bandra]]. In 1879, [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]] constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the ''Degrados de Bomanjee'' ('Steps of Bomanjee').\n\nPeople of all faiths and communities visit the church, giving the place a syncretic nature. The [[Bandra Fair]] is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when pilgrims throng the church.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=255163 Mount Mary fair begins today]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 8 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_devotees-throng-to-bandra-fair-on-opening-day-as-stall-owners-protest_1437121 \"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\"], ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 13 September 2010.</ref>\n\n====Educational institutions====\nThe first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr. [[Francisco de Melo]] in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish.

National College]] was originally set up in 1922 in [[Hyderabad, Pakistan]] under the guidance of [[Annie Besant]].

The [[Thadomal Shahani Engineering College]] was established in 1983 by the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]]. It was the first private engineering institute to be affiliated with the federal [[University of Mumbai]] to offer courses in [[Computer Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]].\n\nThe Rizvi Education Complex, located off [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]], comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); [[Rizvi College of Engineering]] (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management & Catering Technology; [[Rizvi Law College]]; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing & Creative Arts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rizvi.edu.in/|title=Rizvi Education Society|author=|date=|website=www.rizvi.edu.in}}</ref> All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution.\n\n====Bandra lake====\n{{main|Bandra Talao}}\n[[Bandra Lake]], also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir was constructed by a rich [[Konkani]] Muslim of [[Navapada]] (also spelt Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |title=Gazetteer of Thane District \u2013 Places of Interest, 1882| url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-III/places_Bandra.html}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was later acquired by the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]].

In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the [[Mithi River]] in the eastern portion of the city, near the [[Kurla]] border. The newly-formed [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.\n\nAs the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between [[Banda Station|Bandra]] and [[Kurla railway station|Kurla]] stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made [[Banda Station|Bandra]] among the busiest stations in India, surpassing [[Andheri]] and [[Bombay Central]], and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after [[Churchgate railway station]].\n\n==Urban art==\nBandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-ranwar-village.html|title=Ranwar Village|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-bollywood-art-project.html|title=Bollywood Art Project|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref> They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.\nSt+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BollywoodArtProject/|title=Bollywood Art Project \u2013 BAP|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists.

The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director [[Mehboob Khan]] established the [[Mehboob Studio]]s here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, [[Bollywood]]. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.<ref name=pn>{{cite news |title=Mehboob mere, Mehboob tere |url=http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |newspaper=Pune Mirror |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718051651/http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=dn>{{cite news |title=Mumbai, meri mehboob?|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/column_mumbai-meri-mehboob_1504231 |newspaper=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=  7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, [[Bandra-Kurla complex|Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex]], the office of the state housing development authority ([[Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority|MHADA]]) and the office of the [[District Collector]]. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.\n\nMost roads and places in Bandra were given English names during [[British rule]]. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.\n\n* Neighbouring suburbs: [[Dharavi]], [[Khar, Mumbai|Khar]], [[Kurla]], [[Mahim]], [[Santa Cruz (Mumbai)|Santacruz]]\n* Arterial Roads: [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] (S.V Road), [[Linking Road]], Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), [[Hill Road]] (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]] (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), [[Western Express Highway]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] connects the western part of Bandra to [[Worli]] by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic.\n\n[[File:Worli skyline from Bandra.jpg|thumb|300px|Worli skyline as seen from Bandra Reclamation]]\n[[File:Bandra Linking road.jpg|thumb|A stall on Linking Road]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:India Mumbai Bridge .jpg|thumb|[[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] Project]]\n[[Bandra railway station]] is connected with the [[Western Railway Zone (India)|Western Railway]] and the [[Harbour Line]], which is an offshoot of the suburban [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]]. It also has a newly built terminus called [[Bandra Terminus]] in Bandra (E) from where trains bound for northern and western India are scheduled regularly. The important trains include the Bandra-[[New Delhi]] Rajdhani Express, Bandra-[[Indore]] Express, Bandra-[[Patna]] Express, Bandra-[[Jaipur]] Express, Bandra-[[Jodhpur]] Express and the Bandra-[[Amritsar]] Express\n\nPublic transport also includes [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering [[Mahim]], only taxis are allowed to ply.\n\nThe [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] bridge connects Bandra West with [[Worli]], located in central Mumbai. Due to Bandra's central location, most parts of the city are easily accessible.\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:MtMarys.JPG|thumb|right|Mount Mary's Basilica]]\n* [[Jogger's Park]]: Jogger's Park is a small seaside jogging track.
