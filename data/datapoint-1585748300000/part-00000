Although many countries that do not celebrate Christmas have become participants at the competition, the timing has remained the same. In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29\u201331 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|title=About the World Universities Debating Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926120735/http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|archive-date=Sep 26, 2018|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become \"power-paired\" as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the \"government\" (\"proposition\" in the UK and North America) and two the \"opposition\" in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as \"tabbing\". The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return \"ballots\" with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.\n\nThe nine preliminary rounds are followed by a \"break\" at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on [[New Year's Eve]], although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\n\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\n\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\n\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" \u2013 the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship's [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\n\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\n\n== Notable controversies ==\n\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title='Racism' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies.

The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\n\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\n\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\n\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" \u2013 the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship's [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\n\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\n\n== Notable controversies ==\n\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title='Racism' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies.
