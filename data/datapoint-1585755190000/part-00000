The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield]], while the McCoys of Kentucky were under the leadership of [[Randolph McCoy|Randolph \"Ole Ran'l\" McCoy]]. Those involved in the [[feud]] were descended from Joseph Hatfield and William McCoy (born&nbsp;{{circa}}&nbsp;1750). The feud has entered the [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] lexicon as a metonym for any bitterly feuding rival parties. \n\nThe McCoy family lived mostly on the Kentucky side of the Tug Fork; the Hatfields lived mostly on the West Virginia side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |title=From Roots to Nuts: Hatfield Thomas, I |work=Genfan.com |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021439/http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/military-figure/devil-anse-hatfield |title=Devil Anse Hatfield Biography (1839\u20131921) |author=<!-- Biography.com Editors --> |date=December 4, 2014 |website=Biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref> The majority of the Hatfields, although living in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]] (then part of [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]]) fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]]; most McCoys also fought for the Confederates,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/05/29/how-realistic-is-hatfields-and-mccoys/ |title=How Realistic is 'Hatfields and McCoys'? |first=Christopher John |last=Farley |date=May 29, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> with the exception of Asa Harmon McCoy, who fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. The first real violence in the feud was the death of Asa as he returned from the war, murdered by a group of [[Confederate Home Guard]]s called the Logan Wildcats. Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first, but was later confirmed to have been sick at home at the time of the murder. It was widely believed that his uncle, Jim Vance, a member of the Wildcats, committed the murder.{{sfnp|Pearce|1994|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nThe Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. Anse's [[Logging|timbering]] operation was a source of wealth for his family, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. Ole Ran'l owned a {{convert|300|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. Both families had also been involved in the manufacturing and selling of illegal [[moonshine]], a popular commodity at the time.\n\n==Feud==\n[[File:HatfieldClan.jpg|thumbnail|The Hatfield clan in 1897]]\nAsa Harmon McCoy joined the [[45th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Mounted Infantry|45th Kentucky Infantry]] on October 20, 1863. According to his Compiled Service Records, he was \"captured by Rebels\" on December 5, 1863, and was released four months later to a Union hospital in [[Maryland]]. At the time of his capture, he was recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest. During the early months of the Civil War, Asa joined a company of the Pike County Home Guards, under the command of Uriah Runyon, and it is thought he sustained the wound while serving in this unit. William Francis also led a company of Pike County Guards during 1862, and a group of which attacked and shot Mose Christian Cline, a friend of [[Devil Anse Hatfield]]. Although Cline survived his wounds, Anse vowed to retaliate against the responsible parties. Some time in 1863, a group of Confederate Home Guards ambushed and killed Francis as he was leaving his house, and Anse took credit for the deed. Runyon later joined the [[39th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry|39th Kentucky Infantry]] and was killed on May 7, 1864, in Pike County, Kentucky. His Compiled Service Records say \"Killed by Rebels\". \n\nOn [[muster rolls]] beginning on May 6, 1864, Asa is reported in a [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] hospital, suffering from a leg fracture. Beginning in December 1864, the 45th Kentucky Infantry began mustering its regiments out of service. Asa's Company E was mustered out on December 24, 1864, in [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]]. He was killed near his home on January 7, 1865, just thirteen days after leaving the [[Union Army]]. A group of Confederate [[guerilla]]s took credit for the killing and his wife's pension application states that he was \"killed by Rebels\". There are no existing records pertaining to his death and no warrants were issued in connection with the murder. McCoy family tradition points to James \"Jim\" Vance, an uncle of Anse and a member of a West Virginia Militia group, as the culprit.<ref>{{cite book |title=The McCoys: Their Story |first=Truda |last=Williams McCoy |publisher=Press of the Preservation Council of Pike County |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-91681-400-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite archive |item=Fold 3 |collection=Compiled Service Records of Union Soldiers 1861\u20131865 |institution=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] |location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Wayne County, West Virginia in the Civil War |first=Jack L. |last=Dickinson |year=2003 |publisher=Higginson Book Co. |isbn=978-0-74044-086-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Clines and Allied Families of The Tug River Valley |first=Cecil L. |last=Cline |year=1998 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Gateway Press}}</ref>\n\nThe second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred thirteen years later, in 1878, after a dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield, a cousin of Anse's, had the hog, but Randolph McCoy claimed it was his,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/crime/hatfieldmccoy01.html |title=Hatfield-McCoy Feud 75 Years Old Today |first=Shirley |last=Donnelly |newspaper=[[The Register-Herald|Beckley Post-Herald]] |date=August 7, 1957 |via=WV Culture.org |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> saying that the notches on the pig's ears were McCoy, not Hatfield, marks.

Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky [[rum-running|bootlegging]] warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Anse, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported the next day to the county seat in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]]. Despite what was seen as her betrayal of her own family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna for her cousin, Nancy McCoy, whom he wed in 1881.\n\nThe feud continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of Anse, was killed by three of Roseanna's younger brothers: Tolbert, Phamer (Pharmer), and Bud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0807.html|title=On This Day in West Virginia History - August 7|website=www.wvculture.org}}</ref> On an election day in Kentucky, the three McCoy brothers fought a drunken Ellison and his other brother; Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a gunshot. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield [[constable]]s and were taken to Pikeville for trial. Secretly, Anse organized a large group of followers and intercepted the constables and their McCoy prisoners before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia. When Ellison died from his injuries, the McCoy brothers were killed by the Hatfields' [[vigilantism|vigilante justice]] in turn: being tied to [[Asimina|pawpaw]] bushes, where each was shot numerous times with a total of fifty shots fired. Their bodies were described as \"bullet-riddled\".{{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=26}}\n\nEven though the Hatfields and most inhabitants of the area believed their revenge was warranted, up to about twenty men, including Anse, were indicted. All of the Hatfields eluded arrest; this angered the McCoy family, who took their cause up with Perry Cline. Cline, who was married to Martha McCoy, is believed to have used his political connections to reinstate the charges and announced rewards for the Hatfields' arrest as an act of revenge. A few years prior, Cline lost a lawsuit against Anse over the deed to thousands of acres of land, subsequently increasing the hatred between the two families. In 1886, Jeff McCoy killed a mail carrier named Fred Wolford, and the man who went to pursue him for his crime was acting constable Cap Hatfield. Cap and a friend named Tom Wallace shot him while on the run on the banks of the Tug Fork.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kleber |first=John |encyclopedia=The Kentucky Encyclopedia |title=Hatfields and McCoys |date=May 18, 1992 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-81311-772-0 |page=418}}</ref> Tom Wallace was soon found dead in the spring of 1887.\n\n===New Year Massacre===\nThe feud reached its peak during the 1888 New Year's Night Massacre.

With his house burning, Randolph and his remaining family members were able to escape to the woods; his children, unprepared for the elements, suffered [[frostbite]]. The remaining McCoys moved to Pikeville to escape the West Virginia raiding parties.

Eventually, the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received [[life imprisonment]], while the eighth, Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts, was executed by [[hanging]] and buried in an unmarked grave within sight of the gallows. {{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=111}} \n\nEllison had tried to retract his [[confession]], stating that he was innocent, and that he had only confessed because he expected leniency {{ndash}} but his retraction was denied. Thousands attended his hanging in Pikeville, but though the scaffold was in the open, its base was fenced in to comply with laws that had been passed which prohibited public executions. The hanging site is the current location of a classroom building of the present day [[University of Pikeville]]. With his last words, Ellison claimed that; \"The Hatfields made me do it. \" No one had been sent to the gallows in Pike County for forty years, and after Ellison, no one ever was again. \n\nOf those sent to prison:\n* Valentine \"Uncle Wall\" Hatfield, elder brother of Anse, was overshadowed by Anse's ambitions but was one of the eight convicted, dying in prison of unknown causes. He had petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail, but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery, which has since been paved over.\n* Doc D. Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, one of the eight Hatfields convicted, served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son, Melvin.\n* Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, served fourteen years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife, who had remarried but left her second husband to live with Pliant again.\n\nFighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts.

Many improvements to various feud sites were completed.

The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield]], while the McCoys of Kentucky were under the leadership of [[Randolph McCoy|Randolph \"Ole Ran'l\" McCoy]]. Those involved in the [[feud]] were descended from Joseph Hatfield and William McCoy (born&nbsp;{{circa}}&nbsp;1750). The feud has entered the [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] lexicon as a metonym for any bitterly feuding rival parties. \n\nThe McCoy family lived mostly on the Kentucky side of the Tug Fork; the Hatfields lived mostly on the West Virginia side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |title=From Roots to Nuts: Hatfield Thomas, I |work=Genfan.com |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021439/http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/military-figure/devil-anse-hatfield |title=Devil Anse Hatfield Biography (1839\u20131921) |author=<!-- Biography.com Editors --> |date=December 4, 2014 |website=Biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref> The majority of the Hatfields, although living in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]] (then part of [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]]) fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]]; most McCoys also fought for the Confederates,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/05/29/how-realistic-is-hatfields-and-mccoys/ |title=How Realistic is 'Hatfields and McCoys'? |first=Christopher John |last=Farley |date=May 29, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> with the exception of Asa Harmon McCoy, who fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. The first real violence in the feud was the death of Asa as he returned from the war, murdered by a group of [[Confederate Home Guard]]s called the Logan Wildcats. Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first, but was later confirmed to have been sick at home at the time of the murder. It was widely believed that his uncle, Jim Vance, a member of the Wildcats, committed the murder.{{sfnp|Pearce|1994|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nThe Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. Anse's [[Logging|timbering]] operation was a source of wealth for his family, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. Ole Ran'l owned a {{convert|300|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. Both families had also been involved in the manufacturing and selling of illegal [[moonshine]], a popular commodity at the time.\n\n==Feud==\n[[File:HatfieldClan.jpg|thumbnail|The Hatfield clan in 1897]]\nAsa Harmon McCoy joined the [[45th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Mounted Infantry|45th Kentucky Infantry]] on October 20, 1863. According to his Compiled Service Records, he was \"captured by Rebels\" on December 5, 1863, and was released four months later to a Union hospital in [[Maryland]]. At the time of his capture, he was recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest. During the early months of the Civil War, Asa joined a company of the Pike County Home Guards, under the command of Uriah Runyon, and it is thought he sustained the wound while serving in this unit. William Francis also led a company of Pike County Guards during 1862, and a group of which attacked and shot Mose Christian Cline, a friend of [[Devil Anse Hatfield]]. Although Cline survived his wounds, Anse vowed to retaliate against the responsible parties. Some time in 1863, a group of Confederate Home Guards ambushed and killed Francis as he was leaving his house, and Anse took credit for the deed. Runyon later joined the [[39th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry|39th Kentucky Infantry]] and was killed on May 7, 1864, in Pike County, Kentucky. His Compiled Service Records say \"Killed by Rebels\". \n\nOn [[muster rolls]] beginning on May 6, 1864, Asa is reported in a [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] hospital, suffering from a leg fracture. Beginning in December 1864, the 45th Kentucky Infantry began mustering its regiments out of service. Asa's Company E was mustered out on December 24, 1864, in [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]]. He was killed near his home on January 7, 1865, just thirteen days after leaving the [[Union Army]]. A group of Confederate [[guerilla]]s took credit for the killing and his wife's pension application states that he was \"killed by Rebels\". There are no existing records pertaining to his death and no warrants were issued in connection with the murder. McCoy family tradition points to James \"Jim\" Vance, an uncle of Anse and a member of a West Virginia Militia group, as the culprit.<ref>{{cite book |title=The McCoys: Their Story |first=Truda |last=Williams McCoy |publisher=Press of the Preservation Council of Pike County |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-91681-400-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite archive |item=Fold 3 |collection=Compiled Service Records of Union Soldiers 1861\u20131865 |institution=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] |location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Wayne County, West Virginia in the Civil War |first=Jack L. |last=Dickinson |year=2003 |publisher=Higginson Book Co. |isbn=978-0-74044-086-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Clines and Allied Families of The Tug River Valley |first=Cecil L. |last=Cline |year=1998 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Gateway Press}}</ref>\n\nThe second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred thirteen years later, in 1878, after a dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield, a cousin of Anse's, had the hog, but Randolph McCoy claimed it was his,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/crime/hatfieldmccoy01.html |title=Hatfield-McCoy Feud 75 Years Old Today |first=Shirley |last=Donnelly |newspaper=[[The Register-Herald|Beckley Post-Herald]] |date=August 7, 1957 |via=WV Culture.org |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> saying that the notches on the pig's ears were McCoy, not Hatfield, marks.

Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky [[rum-running|bootlegging]] warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Anse, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported the next day to the county seat in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]]. Despite what was seen as her betrayal of her own family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna for her cousin, Nancy McCoy, whom he wed in 1881.\n\nThe feud continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of Anse, was killed by three of Roseanna's younger brothers: Tolbert, Phamer (Pharmer), and Bud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0807.html|title=On This Day in West Virginia History - August 7|website=www.wvculture.org}}</ref> On an election day in Kentucky, the three McCoy brothers fought a drunken Ellison and his other brother; Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a gunshot. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield [[constable]]s and were taken to Pikeville for trial. Secretly, Anse organized a large group of followers and intercepted the constables and their McCoy prisoners before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia. When Ellison died from his injuries, the McCoy brothers were killed by the Hatfields' [[vigilantism|vigilante justice]] in turn: being tied to [[Asimina|pawpaw]] bushes, where each was shot numerous times with a total of fifty shots fired. Their bodies were described as \"bullet-riddled\".{{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=26}}\n\nEven though the Hatfields and most inhabitants of the area believed their revenge was warranted, up to about twenty men, including Anse, were indicted. All of the Hatfields eluded arrest; this angered the McCoy family, who took their cause up with Perry Cline. Cline, who was married to Martha McCoy, is believed to have used his political connections to reinstate the charges and announced rewards for the Hatfields' arrest as an act of revenge. A few years prior, Cline lost a lawsuit against Anse over the deed to thousands of acres of land, subsequently increasing the hatred between the two families. In 1886, Jeff McCoy killed a mail carrier named Fred Wolford, and the man who went to pursue him for his crime was acting constable Cap Hatfield. Cap and a friend named Tom Wallace shot him while on the run on the banks of the Tug Fork.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kleber |first=John |encyclopedia=The Kentucky Encyclopedia |title=Hatfields and McCoys |date=May 18, 1992 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-81311-772-0 |page=418}}</ref> Tom Wallace was soon found dead in the spring of 1887.\n\n===New Year Massacre===\nThe feud reached its peak during the 1888 New Year's Night Massacre.

Eventually, the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received [[life imprisonment]], while the eighth, Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts, was executed by [[hanging]] and buried in an unmarked grave within sight of the gallows. {{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=111}} \n\nEllison had tried to retract his [[confession]], stating that he was innocent, and that he had only confessed because he expected leniency {{ndash}} but his retraction was denied. Thousands attended his hanging in Pikeville, but though the scaffold was in the open, its base was fenced in to comply with laws that had been passed which prohibited public executions. The hanging site is the current location of a classroom building of the present day [[University of Pikeville]]. With his last words, Ellison claimed that; \"The Hatfields made me do it. \" No one had been sent to the gallows in Pike County for forty years, and after Ellison, no one ever was again. \n\nOf those sent to prison:\n* Valentine \"Uncle Wall\" Hatfield, elder brother of Anse, was overshadowed by Anse's ambitions but was one of the eight convicted, dying in prison of unknown causes. He had petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail, but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery, which has since been paved over.\n* Doc D. Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, one of the eight Hatfields convicted, served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son, Melvin.\n* Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, served fourteen years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife, who had remarried but left her second husband to live with Pliant again.\n\nFighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts.
