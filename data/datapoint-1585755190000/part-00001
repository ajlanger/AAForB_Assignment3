Sweeney (ed., ''Lactantii Placidi in Statii Thebaida commentarii libri XII'' (Stuttgart/Leipzig: Teubner) 1997) also indicates that another Placidus, a Christian grammarian, is not to be confused with this Lactantius: {{\"'}}glossae Placidi (ut uidetur, Christiani) nullo modo auctori nostro sunt adscribendae{{'\"}} (p. viii).</ref>\n\nThe name ''Demogorgon'' is introduced in a discussion of ''Thebaid'' 4.516, which mentions \"the supreme being of the threefold world\" (''triplicis mundi summum''). In one manuscript, the author says of Statius, ''Dicit deum Demogorgona summum, cuius scire nomen non licet'' (\"He is speaking of the Demogorgon, the supreme god, whose name it is not permitted to know\", or perhaps \"He is speaking of a god, the supreme Demogorgon\"). Prior to Lactantius, there is no mention of the supposed \"Demogorgon\" anywhere by any writer, pagan or Christian. However, as noted above, there are several different manuscript traditions, including one that gives \"demoirgon\", which has been taken by most critical editors to indicate some form of misconstruction of the Greek ''d\u0113miourgon''. Jahnke thus restores the text to read \"He is speaking of the Demiurge, whose name it is not permitted to know\". However, this phantom word in one of the manuscript traditions took on a life of its own among later scholars.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Demogorgon is mentioned in the tenth-century ''Adnotationes super Lucanum'', a series of short notes to [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' that are included in the ''[[Commenta Bernensia]]'', the \"Berne Scholia on Lucan\".<ref>[http://www.chronarchy.com/esus/lucan-commentaries.html \"The Berne Scholia\"]; ''Adnotationes super Lucanum,'' vi.746, are mentioned in Daniel Ogden's ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 198.</ref>\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, the reality of a primordial \"Demogorgon\" was so well fixed in the European imagination that \"Demogorgon's son Pan\" became a bizarre variant reading for \"Hermes' son Pan\" in one manuscript tradition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia Deorum gentilium]]'' (\"Genealogies of the Gods\":1.3\u20134 and 2.1), misreading a line in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBoccaccio's ''Demogorgon'' is mentioned as a \"primal\" god in quite a few [[Renaissance]] texts, and impressively [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]ed \"Demon-Gorgon,\" i.e., \"Terror-Demon\" or \"God of the Earth\". The French historian and mythographer [[Jean Seznec]], for instance, now determines in ''Demogorgon'' an allusion to the [[Demiurge]] (\"Craftsman\" or \"Maker\") of [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus.'']] For a remarkable early text identifying Ovid's Demiurge (1/1, here) as \"sovereign Demogorgon\", see the paraphrase of ''Metamorphoses'' I in Abraham France, ''The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch'' (London, 1592), sig.

In Milton's epic poem Satan passes through this region while traveling from Hell to Earth.\n\nDemogorgon's name was earlier invoked by [[Faust]]us in Scene III of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1590) when the eponymous Doctor summons [[Mephistopheles]] with a Latin incantation.\n\nThe sixteenth-century Dutch demonologist [[Johann Weyer]] described Demogorgon as the master of fate in hell's hierarchy.<ref name=\"rudwin87\">{{cite book|last=Rudwin|first=Maximilian|title=The Devil in Legend and Literature|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1970|origyear=1931|edition=2nd|page=80|isbn=0-404-05451-X}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s lesser work ''I Cinque Canti'',<ref>[https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Opere_minori_1_(Ariosto)/I_Cinque_Canti/Canto_I] Ludovico Ariosto - Opere minori (tomo I)</ref> Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in the Imavo mountains (today's Himalaya) where every five years [[Moirai|the Fates]] and [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] are all summoned to appear before him and give an account of their actions.

When elements of Ariosto's poem supplied [[Philippe Quinault]]'s libretto for [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera ''Roland'', performed at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], 8 January 1685, Demogorgon was king of the fairies and master of ceremonies.\n\nDemogorgon also is mentioned in the Book II of the epic poem ''[[El Bernardo]]'' written in Mexico by [[Bernardo de Balbuena]] and published in Spain in 1624. The passage tells how the fairy, \"Alcina\", visits Demogorgon in his infernal palace:\n<blockquote>Aqu\u00ed Demogorgon est\u00e1 sentado<br>en su banco fatal, cuyo decreto<br>de las supremas causas es guardado<br>por inviolable y celestial preceto.<br>Las parcas y su estambre delicado<br>a cuyo huso el mundo est\u00e1 sujeto,<br>la fea muerte y el vivir l\u00facido<br>y el negro lago del oscuro olvido\n<br> \u2014 (Libro II, estrofa 19)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is mentioned in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'':\n\n<blockquote>A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name<br>Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,<br>At which [[Cocytus]] quakes, and [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] is put to flight.\n<br> \u2014 (Canto I, stanza 37)</blockquote>\n\nand:\n\n<blockquote>Downe in the bottome of the deepe ''Abysse''<br>Where ''Demogorgon'' in dull darknesse pent,<br>Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,<br>The hideous ''Chaos'' keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is. \n<br> \u2014 (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is the central character in [[Voltaire]]'s 1756 short story \"[[Plato's Dream]]\" - a \"lesser superbeing\" who was responsible for creating the planet Earth.\n\nHe is also the protagonist of an opera ''Il Demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso'' (\"Demogorgon, or the Confused Philosopher\" by [[Vincenzo Righini]] (1786) with a libretto by [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], which originally was written for [[Mozart]].<ref>\"Non tardar amato bene,\" left incomplete by Mozart was inserted in Da Ponte's next project, ''Il Demogorgone'' (D. Heartz, \"Mozart and Da Ponte\", ''The Musical Quarterly'', 1995); the question \" how did Righini wind up setting a text written for Mozart, and how could\na text designed for a different opera fit successfully into II demogorgone?\" is addressed in \nJ Stone, \"Mozart's Theory of Opera, 13 October 1781\" ''The Musical Times'', 1991.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', the first mate of the ship, ''Pequod'', Starbuck, describes [[Moby Dick (whale)|the white whale]] as the demogorgon of the ship's \"heathen crew\" (see ch. XXXVIII, paragraph 2).\n\nDemogorgon also appears as a character in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. In this lyrical drama, Demogorgon is the offspring of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Thetis]] who eventually dethrones Jupiter. It is never mentioned whether Demogorgon, portrayed as a dark, shapeless spirit, is female or male. The theory of Demogorgon's name originating from Greek ''demos'' and ''gorgos'' may be the foundation for its use in this text as an allusion to a politically active and revolutionary populace.<ref>Paul Foot.

However, as noted above, there are several different manuscript traditions, including one that gives \"demoirgon\", which has been taken by most critical editors to indicate some form of misconstruction of the Greek ''d\u0113miourgon''. Jahnke thus restores the text to read \"He is speaking of the Demiurge, whose name it is not permitted to know\". However, this phantom word in one of the manuscript traditions took on a life of its own among later scholars.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Demogorgon is mentioned in the tenth-century ''Adnotationes super Lucanum'', a series of short notes to [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' that are included in the ''[[Commenta Bernensia]]'', the \"Berne Scholia on Lucan\".<ref>[http://www.chronarchy.com/esus/lucan-commentaries.html \"The Berne Scholia\"]; ''Adnotationes super Lucanum,'' vi.746, are mentioned in Daniel Ogden's ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 198.</ref>\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, the reality of a primordial \"Demogorgon\" was so well fixed in the European imagination that \"Demogorgon's son Pan\" became a bizarre variant reading for \"Hermes' son Pan\" in one manuscript tradition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia Deorum gentilium]]'' (\"Genealogies of the Gods\":1.3\u20134 and 2.1), misreading a line in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBoccaccio's ''Demogorgon'' is mentioned as a \"primal\" god in quite a few [[Renaissance]] texts, and impressively [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]ed \"Demon-Gorgon,\" i.e., \"Terror-Demon\" or \"God of the Earth\". The French historian and mythographer [[Jean Seznec]], for instance, now determines in ''Demogorgon'' an allusion to the [[Demiurge]] (\"Craftsman\" or \"Maker\") of [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus.'']] For a remarkable early text identifying Ovid's Demiurge (1/1, here) as \"sovereign Demogorgon\", see the paraphrase of ''Metamorphoses'' I in Abraham France, ''The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch'' (London, 1592), sig. A2v.\"<ref>Dr Daniel Kinney, \"Ovid Illustrated: The Renaissance Reception of Ovid in Image and Text\" linked below.</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nDemogorgon was taken up by Christian writers as a demon of Hell:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name\nOf Demogorgon</poem>|[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' II. 966.}}\n\nNote, however, Milton does not refer to the inhabitants of Hell, but of an unformed region where [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] rules with Night. In Milton's epic poem Satan passes through this region while traveling from Hell to Earth.\n\nDemogorgon's name was earlier invoked by [[Faust]]us in Scene III of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1590) when the eponymous Doctor summons [[Mephistopheles]] with a Latin incantation.\n\nThe sixteenth-century Dutch demonologist [[Johann Weyer]] described Demogorgon as the master of fate in hell's hierarchy.<ref name=\"rudwin87\">{{cite book|last=Rudwin|first=Maximilian|title=The Devil in Legend and Literature|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1970|origyear=1931|edition=2nd|page=80|isbn=0-404-05451-X}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s lesser work ''I Cinque Canti'',<ref>[https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Opere_minori_1_(Ariosto)/I_Cinque_Canti/Canto_I] Ludovico Ariosto - Opere minori (tomo I)</ref> Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in the Imavo mountains (today's Himalaya) where every five years [[Moirai|the Fates]] and [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] are all summoned to appear before him and give an account of their actions. They travel through the air in various strange conveyances, and it is no easy matter to distinguish between their convention and a [[Witches' Sabbath]]. When elements of Ariosto's poem supplied [[Philippe Quinault]]'s libretto for [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera ''Roland'', performed at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], 8 January 1685, Demogorgon was king of the fairies and master of ceremonies.\n\nDemogorgon also is mentioned in the Book II of the epic poem ''[[El Bernardo]]'' written in Mexico by [[Bernardo de Balbuena]] and published in Spain in 1624. The passage tells how the fairy, \"Alcina\", visits Demogorgon in his infernal palace:\n<blockquote>Aqu\u00ed Demogorgon est\u00e1 sentado<br>en su banco fatal, cuyo decreto<br>de las supremas causas es guardado<br>por inviolable y celestial preceto.<br>Las parcas y su estambre delicado<br>a cuyo huso el mundo est\u00e1 sujeto,<br>la fea muerte y el vivir l\u00facido<br>y el negro lago del oscuro olvido\n<br> \u2014 (Libro II, estrofa 19)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is mentioned in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'':\n\n<blockquote>A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name<br>Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,<br>At which [[Cocytus]] quakes, and [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] is put to flight.\n<br> \u2014 (Canto I, stanza 37)</blockquote>\n\nand:\n\n<blockquote>Downe in the bottome of the deepe ''Abysse''<br>Where ''Demogorgon'' in dull darknesse pent,<br>Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,<br>The hideous ''Chaos'' keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is. \n<br> \u2014 (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is the central character in [[Voltaire]]'s 1756 short story \"[[Plato's Dream]]\" - a \"lesser superbeing\" who was responsible for creating the planet Earth.\n\nHe is also the protagonist of an opera ''Il Demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso'' (\"Demogorgon, or the Confused Philosopher\" by [[Vincenzo Righini]] (1786) with a libretto by [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], which originally was written for [[Mozart]].<ref>\"Non tardar amato bene,\" left incomplete by Mozart was inserted in Da Ponte's next project, ''Il Demogorgone'' (D. Heartz, \"Mozart and Da Ponte\", ''The Musical Quarterly'', 1995); the question \" how did Righini wind up setting a text written for Mozart, and how could\na text designed for a different opera fit successfully into II demogorgone?\" is addressed in \nJ Stone, \"Mozart's Theory of Opera, 13 October 1781\" ''The Musical Times'', 1991.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', the first mate of the ship, ''Pequod'', Starbuck, describes [[Moby Dick (whale)|the white whale]] as the demogorgon of the ship's \"heathen crew\" (see ch. XXXVIII, paragraph 2).\n\nDemogorgon also appears as a character in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. In this lyrical drama, Demogorgon is the offspring of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Thetis]] who eventually dethrones Jupiter. It is never mentioned whether Demogorgon, portrayed as a dark, shapeless spirit, is female or male. The theory of Demogorgon's name originating from Greek ''demos'' and ''gorgos'' may be the foundation for its use in this text as an allusion to a politically active and revolutionary populace.<ref>Paul Foot.
