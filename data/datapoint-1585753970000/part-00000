{"title_page": "Warrowen massacre", "text_new": "{{short description|Apparent mass killing in Australia}}\nThe '''Warrowen massacre''' was an apparent mass killing of [[Bunurong]] people by a group of [[Kurnai]] people in the vicinity of present-day [[Brighton, Victoria]], Australia. It is dated to the early 1830s, close in time to the founding of [[Melbourne]]. The killing was recorded separately several years later by [[William Thomas (Australian settler)|William Thomas]] and [[George Augustus Robinson]], based on testimony from Aboriginal sources. Thomas stated that at least 60 people had been killed. According to Robinson, the massacre contributed to the end of an entire Bunurong clan, allowing a Kurnai clan to take over their territory.\n\n==Background==\nEarly European settlers in the [[Western Port]] and [[Gippsland]] regions of Victoria were told that there had been a long-running conflict between indigenous groups, with \"each carrying out surprise attacks on the other and killing several people at a time\".{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=58}} According to Robinson, the victims of the massacre at Warrowen were the Yowengerre (or Yowenjerre) and the perpetrators were the Borro Borro Willun.{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=255\u2013256}} There was an \"existing tenuous connection\" between the two, as their respective neighbours exchanged women for marriages.{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=61}} The Yowengerre (or Yowenjerre) were the easternmost clan of the [[Bunurong]] people, occupying the [[Tarwin River]] watershed and parts of [[Wilson's Promontory]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2014}}: \"[...] the Yowengerre, the eastern-most Boonwurrung clan, which was associated with the Tarwin River watershed and Wilson's Promontory\"</ref>{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=59}} The traditional country of the Borro Borro ''willun'' (clan) of the [[Gunai people|Gunai]] (Kurnai) was the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] of Gippsland. The Borro Borro were surrounded by a larger group, the [[Braiakaulung people|Braiakaulung]] (Briakalung), but were more closely linked with the [[Brataualung people|Brataualung]] to the south.{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=60}}\n\n==Events==\n\nThe main sources for the massacre are the letters of [[William Thomas (Australian settler)|William Thomas]], the Assistant Protector of Aborigines of Port Phillip. In an 1840 letter to Superintendent [[Charles La Trobe]], he wrote that \"about four years ago 77 people were killed at Little Brighton not nine miles from Melbourne\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=255}} The letter listed \"events in which the Bonurong had suffered at the hands of the Kurnai\", in order to \"explain to La Trobe the deadly enmity that had existed for a very long time between the Bonurong and their eastern neighbours\". He further explained that he had \"known about these historic events almost from when he arrived in Melbourne, and that they\nformed part of the Bonurong [[Oral history|singing]]\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=254-255}}\n\nIn a later report in 1849, Thomas recorded that: {{quotation|[the] blacks remember the awful affair at Warrowen (place of sorrow) near where Brighton now stands, where in 1834 nearly a quarter of the Western Port blacks were massacred by the Gippsland blacks who stole up on them before dawn of day.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas|first=William|date=1849 |title=Thomas Half yearly Report |url= |location=unit 11,1850/55,PROV |publisher=VPRS 10|page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>}}\n\nThomas gave further detail of the massacre in his description of an incised tree in a paper on Aboriginal monuments and inscriptions:\n{{quotation|[They have] no monuments whatever further than devices on trees where any great calamity have befallen them.

Near this spot in the year 1833 or 4, the Gippsland blacks stole at night upon the Western Port or Coast tribe and killed 60 or 70 of them.{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=256}}}}\n\nWhile passing through Gippsland in 1844, [[George Augustus Robinson]] wrote in his diaries that \"the natives of Gippsland have killed 70 of the Boongerong [Bunurong] at Brighton\".
