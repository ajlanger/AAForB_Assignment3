He was a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest honor for valor given by the United States, and was a pioneering American aviator, polar explorer, and organizer of polar logistics. Aircraft flights in which he served as a [[navigator]] and expedition leader crossed the Atlantic Ocean, a segment of the Arctic Ocean, and a segment of the [[Antarctic Plateau]]. Byrd claimed that his expeditions had been the first to reach both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] by air. His claim to have reached the North Pole is disputed.<ref name=\"ElWZQ\" /> He is also known for discovering [[Mount Sidley]], the largest dormant volcano in Antarctica, in 1934.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Richard E. Byrd.svg|upright|thumb|left|Ancestral Coat of Arms of the Byrd family]]\n\n===Ancestry===\nByrd was born in Winchester, Virginia, the son of Esther Bolling (Flood) and [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.]] He was a descendant of one of the [[First Families of Virginia]]. His ancestors include planter [[John Rolfe]] and his wife [[Pocahontas]], [[William Byrd II]] of [[Westover Plantation]], who established [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and [[Robert Carter I|Robert \"King\" Carter]], a colonial governor. He was the brother of [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry F. Byrd]], a dominant figure in the [[Virginia]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from the 1920s until the 1960s; [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.|their father]] served as [[Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates|Speaker]] of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] for a time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Marriage===\nOn January 20, 1915, Richard married Marie Donaldson Ames (d. 1974). He would later name a region of Antarctic land he discovered \"[[Marie Byrd Land]]\" after her. They had four children \u2013 [[Richard Evelyn Byrd III]], Evelyn Bolling Byrd Clarke, Katharine Agnes Byrd Breyer, and Helen Byrd Stabler. By late 1924, the Byrd family moved into a large brownstone house at 9 Brimmer Street in Boston's fashionable [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood<ref name=\":2\" /> that had been purchased by Marie's father, a wealthy industrialist.<ref name=\"zn5uY\" />\n\n===Personal life===\n\nByrd was friends with [[Edsel Ford]] and his father [[Henry Ford]], whose admiration of his polar exploits helped to gain Byrd sponsorship and financing for his various polar expeditions from the Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"5NUPW\" />\n\n==Education and early naval career==\nByrd attended the [[Virginia Military Institute]] for two years and spent one year at the [[University of Virginia]] before financial circumstances inspired his transfer to the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he was appointed as a [[Midshipman|midshipman]] on May 28, 1908.<ref name=\"va3U5\" />   While at the Naval Academy, he suffered two injuries to this right ankle (one was by playing football and the other was while dismounting gymnastic rings during a competition).  Although he was allowed to remain at the Academy, his injuries eventually led to his forced retirement from the Navy in 1916.  \n\nOn June 8, 1912, Byrd graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the United States Navy. On July 14, 1912, he was assigned to the battleship [[USS Wyoming (BB-32)|USS ''Wyoming'']].  During service in the Caribbean Sea, Byrd received his first letter of commendation, and later a [[Lifesaving Medal|Silver Lifesaving Medal]], for twice plunging fully clothed to the rescue of a sailor who had fallen overboard.  In April 1914 he transferred to the armored cruiser [[USS Washington (ACR-11)|USS ''Washington'']] and served in Mexican waters in June following the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]] in April.\n\nHis next assignment was to the gunboat [[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|USS ''Dolphin'']], which also served as the yacht of the Secretary of the Navy.  This assignment brought Byrd into contact with high-ranking officials and dignitaries including then [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on June 8, 1915.  During Byrd's assignment to ''Dolphin'' she was commanded by future [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]], who served as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"eitvO\" />   Byrd's last assignment before forced retirement was to the presidential yacht [[USS Mayflower (PY-1)|USS ''Mayflower'']].\n\nOn March 15, 1916, Byrd, much to his frustration, was medically retired on three quarters pay for an ankle injury he suffered on board ''Mayflower''.  Shortly afterwards, he was assigned as the Inspector and Instructor for the [[Rhode Island Naval Militia]] in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=\"fmg93\" />  On December 14, 1916, he was commissioned as a commander in the Rhode Island Naval Militia.<ref name=\"CLCLA\" />  In this position he was commended by Brigadier General [[Charles Wheaton Abbot Jr.|Charles W. Abbot]], the Adjutant General of Rhode Island, with making great strides in improving the efficiency of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  On April 25, 1928, by act of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he was promoted to captain in the Rhode Island Naval Militia in recognition of his flight to the North Pole in 1926.<ref name=\"AVXRl\" />\n\n==First World War==\n[[File:Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s (exbt-iceberg-47).jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s]]\nShortly after the entry of the United States into the First World War in April 1917, Byrd oversaw the mobilization of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  He was then recalled to active duty and was assigned to the Office of Naval Operations and served in a desk job as secretary and organizer of the Navy Department Commission on Training Camps.  In the autumn of 1917 he was sent naval aviation school at [[Pensacola Naval Air Station|Pensacola, Florida]].  He qualified as a Naval Aviator (number 608) in June 1918.<ref name=\"jYcqJ\" />  He then commanded naval air forces at [[Naval Air Station Halifax]] in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada from July 1918 until the armistice in November.  In that assignment he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant and the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />\n\nFor his services during the war, he received a letter of commendation from Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], which was after World War II converted to a [[Navy Commendation Medal]].\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the war, Byrd volunteered to be a crewmember in the U.S. Navy's 1919 aerial [[Transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] crossing.   This mission was historic as it was the first time the Atlantic Ocean would by crossed by an aircraft.   It was decided that only men who had not served overseas would be allowed on the mission.  Unfortunately for Byrd, his tour of duty in New Foundland was considered overseas service.  Byrd was, however, able to make a valuable contribution as his expertise in aerial navigation resulted in his appointment to plan the flight path of the mission.  Of the three [[flying boats]] (NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4) that started from New Foundland, only Lieutenant Commander [[Albert Cushing Read|Albert Read]]'s [[NC-4]] completed the trip on May 18, 1919, achieving the first ever transatlantic flight.<ref name=\"oqTJ3\" />\n\nIn 1921 Byrd volunteered to attempt a solo non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean - prefiguring [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s historic flight by six years.  Byrd's ambition was dashed by then acting [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], who felt the risks outweighed the potential rewards.  Byrd was then assigned to the ill fated dirigible [[ZR-2|''ZR-2'']] (formerly known by the British designation of ''R-38'').  As fate would have it, Byrd missed his train to take him to the airship on August 24, 1921.  The airship broke apart in midair, killing 44 of 49 crewmembers on board.  Byrd lost several friends in the accident and was involved in the subsequent recovery operations and investigation.  The accident affected him deeply and inspired him to make safety a top priority in all of his future expeditions.\n\nDue to reductions in the Navy after the First World War, Byrd reverted to the rank of lieutenant at the end of 1921.\n\nDuring the summer of 1923 then Lieutenant Byrd and a group of volunteer Navy veterans of the First World War helped found the [[Naval Air Station Squantum|Naval Reserve Air Station]] (NRAS) at [[Squantum Point]] near Boston, using an unused First World War seaplane hangar which had remained more-or-less intact after the [[Victory Destroyer Plant]] shipyard was built on the site. NRAS Squantum was commissioned on August 15, 1923, and is considered to have been the first air base in the Naval Reserve program.<ref name=\"Rpfen\" />\n\nByrd commanded the aviation unit of the arctic expedition to North Greenland led by [[Donald B. MacMillan]] from June to October 1925.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />  It was during this expedition that Byrd made the acquaintance of Navy Chief Aviation Pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] and Norwegian pilot [[Bernt Balchen]].  Bennett would serve as his pilot in his flight to the North Pole the next year.  Balchen, who's knowledge of arctic flight operations proved invaluable, would be the primary pilot on Byrd's flight to the South Pole in 1929.\n\n{{anchor|1926 North Pole flight}}\n\n==1926 North Pole flight==\n[[File:Fokker F.VII plane of Byrd-Bennett in flight in 1926.jpg|thumb|right|The Fokker F.VII of Byrd and Bennett in flight.]]\nOn May 9, 1926, Byrd and Navy [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief Aviation Pilot]] [[Floyd Bennett]] attempted a flight over the North Pole in a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VIIa/3m]] Tri-motor monoplane named ''Josephine Ford'' after the daughter of [[Ford Motor Company]] president [[Edsel Ford]], who helped finance the expedition. The flight left from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) and returned to its take-off airfield, lasting fifteen hours and fifty-seven minutes, including 13 minutes spent circling at their Farthest North.<ref name=\":2\" /> Byrd and Bennett claimed to have reached the North Pole, a distance of 1,535 miles (1,335 [[nautical mile]]s).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhen he returned to the United States from the Arctic, Byrd became a national hero. Congress passed a special act on December 21, 1926, promoting him to the rank of commander and awarding both him and Floyd Bennett the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref name=\"bJpsT\" /> Bennett was promoted to the [[warrant officer]] rank of Machinist. Byrd and Bennett were presented with [[Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor|Tiffany Cross]] versions of the Medal of Honor on March 5, 1927 at the [[White House]] by President [[Calvin Coolidge]].<ref name=\"b3RS8\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n[[File:Fokker FVIIa3m wiki.jpg|thumb|left|The Fokker FVIIa/3M \u2013 \"Josephine Ford\", on display at [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] ]]\nSince 1926, there have been doubts raised, defenses made, and heated controversy over whether or not Byrd actually reached the North Pole. In 1958, [[Norwegian-American]] aviator and explorer [[Bernt Balchen]] cast doubt on Byrd's claim on the basis of his knowledge of the airplane's speed.<ref name=\"gookz\" /> Balchen claimed that Bennett had confessed to him months after the flight that he and Byrd had not reached the pole.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Nash\" /> Bennett died on April 25, 1928, during a flight to rescue downed aviators in Greenland. However, Bennett had started a memoir, given numerous interviews, and wrote an article for an aviation magazine about the flight before his death that all confirmed Byrd's version of the flight.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe 1996 release of Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926 flight revealed erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official report to the National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19\u00b025'30\", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18\u00b018'18\".<ref name=\"vLD1b\" /> On the basis of this and other data in the diary, [[Dennis Rawlins]] concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole.<ref name=\"6gYQw\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccepting that the conflicting data in the typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward [[ground speed]]s greater than the flight's eighty-five mph [[airspeed]], a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving [[anticyclone]] that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data<ref name=\"fukGs\" /><ref name=\"fC461\" />). This suggestion has been challenged by [[Dennis Rawlins]] who adds that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1\", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIf Byrd and Bennett did not reach the North Pole, then the first flight over the Pole occurred a few days later, on May 12, 1926, with the flight of the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' that flew from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) to [[Alaska]] nonstop with a crew including [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Umberto Nobile]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and [[Lincoln Ellsworth]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"kAWPY\" />\n\n==1927 Trans-Atlantic flight==\n[[File:Lt com byrd and aircraft.jpg|right|thumb|Lt. Com. Byrd and aircraft]]\nIn 1927, Byrd announced he had the backing of the [[American Trans-Oceanic Company]], which had been established in 1914 by department-store magnate [[Rodman Wanamaker]] for the purpose of building aircraft to complete non-stop flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Byrd was one of several aviators who attempted to win the [[Orteig Prize]] in 1927 for making the first nonstop flight between the United States and France.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nOnce again Byrd named Floyd Bennett as his chief pilot, with Norwegian [[Bernt Balchen]], [[Bert Acosta]], and Lieutenant [[George Otto Noville|George Noville]] as other crewmembers. During a practice takeoff with Tony Fokker at the controls and Bennett in the co-pilot seat, the [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker Trimotor]] airplane, ''[[America (airplane)|America]]'', crashed, severely injuring Bennett and slightly injuring Byrd. As the plane was being repaired, [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize by completing his historic flight on May 21, 1927. (Coincidentally, in 1925, then [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service Reserve Corps]] Lieutenant Charles Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Byrd's North Pole expedition, but, apparently, his bid came too late.)<ref name=\"Berg\" />\n\nByrd continued with his quest to cross the Atlantic non-stop, naming Balchen to replace Bennett, who had not yet fully recovered from his injuries, as chief pilot. Byrd, Balchen, Acosta, and Noville flew from Roosevelt Field [[East Garden City, New York]] in the ''America'' on June 29, 1927.  On board was mail from the US Postal Service to demonstrate the practicality of aircraft.  Arriving over France the next day, they were prevented from landing in Paris by cloud cover; they returned to the coast of [[Normandy]] and crash-landed near the beach at [[Ver-sur-Mer]] (known as [[Gold Beach]] during the [[Normandy Invasion]] on June 6, 1944) without fatalities on July 1, 1927.<ref name=\"ucqIu\" />  In France, Byrd and his crew were received as heroes and Byrd was invested as an Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]] by Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincare]] on July 6.<ref name=\"6SieQ\" />\n\nAfter their return to the United States, an elaborate dinner in their honor in New York City on July 19.  Byrd and Noville were awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] by Secretary of the Navy [[Curtis D. Wilbur]] at the dinner.<ref name=\"iNgXi\" /> Acosta and Balchen did not receive the Distinguished Flying Cross because, at that time, it could only be awarded to members of the armed services and not to civilians.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nByrd wrote an article for the August 1927 edition of ''Popular Science Monthly'' in which he accurately predicted that while specially modified aircraft with one to three crewmen would fly the Atlantic non-stop, it would be another 20 years before it would be realized on a commercial scale.<ref name=\"mheH3\" />\n\n==Early Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===First Antarctic expedition (1928\u20131930)===\n[[File:Remains of Fokker aircraft, First Byrd Expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Remains of Fokker aircraft in the [[Rockefeller Mountains]], Antarctica in 1993]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09158, Expeditionsschiff Byrds.jpg|thumb|left|Byrd's expedition]]\nIn 1928, Byrd began his [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal|first expedition]] to the [[Antarctic]] involving two ships and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was the [[City of New York (1885 ship)|''City of New York'']] (a Norwegian sealing ship previously named ''Samson'' that had come into fame as a ship some claimed was in the vicinity of the [[RMS Titanic]] when the latter was sinking) and the [[Vamar Shipwreck Site|''Eleanor Bolling'']] (named after Byrd's mother); a [[Ford Trimotor]] airplane called the ''[[Floyd Bennett]]'' (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions) flown by [[Dean Smith (American pioneer pilot)#Byrd expedition|Dean Smith]]; a [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] [[Fairchild FC-2|FC-2W2]], NX8006, built 1928, named \"Stars And Stripes\" (now displayed at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]], on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]]); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the ''Virginia'' (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named \"[[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]]\" was constructed on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] and scientific expeditions by [[snowshoe]], [[dog-sled]], [[snowmobile]], and [[airplane]] began.<ref name=\":6\" />   In order to increase the interest of youth in arctic exploration, a 19-year-old American [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], [[Paul Siple|Paul Allman Siple]], was chosen to accompany the expedition.  Siple would go on to earn an doctorate degree and was probably the only person, other than Byrd himself, to participate in all five of Byrd's Antarctic expeditions.\n\nPhotographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on November 28, 1929, the first flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot [[Bernt Balchen]], co-pilot/radioman [[Harold June]], and photographer [[Ashley Chadbourne McKinley|Ashley McKinley]], flew the ''Floyd Bennett'' to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau, but they were ultimately successful.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-0893e7.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Byrd (circa 1955)]]\n\nAs a result of his acheivement, Byrd was promoted to the rank of [[rear admiral]] by a special act of Congress on December 21, 1929. As he was only 41 years old at the time, this promotion made Byrd the youngest admiral in the history of the United States Navy.<ref name=\"1GPaH\" />  By way of comparison, none of his Annapolis classmates would become admirals until 1942, after 30 years of commissioned service.  He is one of only three persons, one being Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] and the other being arctic explorer [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]], to have been promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy without having first held the rank of captain.\n\nAfter a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on June 18, 1930.  Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the [[American Geographical Society]]. This was also seen in the film ''[[With Byrd at the South Pole]]'' (1930) which covered his trip there.\n\nByrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931\u20131935) of [[Pi Gamma Mu]], the international honor society in the social sciences. He carried the Society's flag during his first Antarctic expedition to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences.<ref name=\"Richard E. Byrd 1888-1957\" /><ref name=\"Byrd Antarctic Expedition III\" />\n\nIn order to finance and gain both political and public support for his expeditions, Byrd actively cultivated relationships with many powerful individuals.  These individuals included, but were not limited to, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Edsel Ford]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and [[Vincent Astor]].  As a token of his gratitude, Byrd named geographic features in the Antarctic after his supporters.\n\n===Second Antarctic expedition===\nOn his second expedition in 1934, Byrd spent five winter months alone operating a [[meteorology|meteorological]] station, Advance Base, from which he narrowly escaped with his life after suffering [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning from a poorly ventilated stove. Unusual radio transmissions from Byrd finally began to alarm the men at the base camp, who then attempted to go to Advance Base. The first two trips were failures due to darkness, snow, and mechanical troubles. Finally, [[Thomas Poulter]], [[E.J. Demas]], and [[Amory Waite]] arrived at Advance Base, where they found Byrd in poor physical health. The men remained at Advance Base until October 12 when an airplane from the base camp picked up Dr. Poulter and Byrd. The rest of the men returned to base camp with the tractor.<ref name=\":2\" /> This expedition is described by Byrd in his autobiography ''Alone''. It is also commemorated in a U.S. postage stamp issued at the time, and a considerable amount of mail using it was sent from Byrd's base at [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]].\n\nA CBS radio station, KFZ,  was set up on the base camp ship, the [[USS Bear|''Bear of Oakland'']] and ''The Adventures of Admiral Byrd'' were short waved to Buenos Aires then relayed to New York.<ref name=\"zw56a\" />\n\nIn late 1938 Byrd visited Hamburg and was invited to participate in the 1938/1939 German \"[[New Swabia|Neuschwabenland]]\" Antarctic Expedition, but declined. (Although Germany was not at war with the United States at this time, Adolf Hitler had been serving as [[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer of the German Reich]] since 1934 and invaded Poland the next year.)\n\n===Antarctic Service Expedition (1939\u20131940)===\n{{main|United States Antarctic Service Expedition}}\nByrd's [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition|third expedition]] was the first one financed and conducted by the United States Government. The project included extensive studies of geology, biology, meteorology and exploration.  The innovative [[Antarctic Snow Cruiser]] was brought with the expedition but broke down shortly after arriving.  \n\nWithin a few months, in March 1940, Byrd was recalled to active duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The expedition continued in Antarctica without him until the lasts of its participants left Antarctica on March 22, 1941.\n\n==World War II==\nAs a senior officer in the United States Navy, Byrd served on active duty during World War II.  He was recalled on active duty on March 26, 1942 and served as the confidential advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations (i.e. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]]). From 1942 to 1945 he joined the South Pacific Island Base Inspection Board, which had important missions to the Pacific, including surveys of remote islands for airfields. On one assignment he visited the fighting front in Europe.\n\nOn February 10, 1945, Byrd received the [[Order of Christopher Columbus]] from the government of the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name=\"QBmaR\" /> Byrd was present at the [[Japanese surrender]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on September 2, 1945.   He was released from active duty on October 1, 1945.\n\nIn recognition of his service during World War II, Byrd was twice awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Later Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===Operation Highjump (1946\u20131947)===\n[[File:Alone (Richard Byrd autobiography - cover art).png|right|thumb|upright|Cover of Byrd's autobiography]]\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-6854e2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Admiral Byrd during ''Operation Deep Freeze&nbsp;I'' (Dec.&nbsp;1955)]]\nIn 1946, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] appointed Byrd as officer in charge of Antarctic Developments Project.  Byrd's fourth Antarctic expedition was codenamed [[Operation Highjump]].<ref name=\":2\" />  It was the largest Antarctic expedition to date and was expected to last six to eight months.\n\nThe expedition was supported by a large naval force (designated Task Force 68), commanded by Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Cruzen]].  There were thirteen US Navy support ships (besides the flagship {{USS|Mount Olympus|AGC-8|6}} and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|6}}), six helicopters, six flying boats, two seaplane tenders, and fifteen other aircraft. The total number of personnel involved was over 4,000.\n\nThe armada arrived in the Ross Sea on December 31, 1946, and made aerial explorations of an area half the size of the United States, recording ten new mountain ranges. The major area covered was the eastern coastline of Antarctica from 150 degrees east to the Greenwich meridian.\n\nAdmiral Byrd was interviewed by Lee van Atta of [[International News Service]] aboard the expedition's command ship [[USS Mount Olympus (AGC-8)|USS Mount Olympus]], in which he discussed the lessons learned from the operation. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', and read in part as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking&nbsp;\u2013 recalled the admiral \u2013 is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.<ref name=\"SrP7R\" /><ref name=\"wVU0G\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1948 the U.S. Navy produced a documentary about Operation Highjump named ''[[The Secret Land]]''.  The film shows live action footage of the operation along with a few re-enacted scenes.  It won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.\n\nOn December 8, 1954, Byrd appeared on the television show Longines Chronoscope. He was interviewed by Larry LeSueur and Kenneth Crawford about his Antarctic voyages, and claimed that Antarctica, in the future, would become the most important place in the world for science.<ref name=\"d7E2H\" />\n\n===Operation Deep Freeze I (1955\u20131956)===\nAs part of the multinational collaboration for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) 1957\u201358, Byrd commanded the U.S. Navy [[Operation Deep Freeze|Operation Deep Freeze I]] in 1955\u201356 which established permanent Antarctic bases at [[McMurdo Sound]], the [[Bay of Whales]], and the [[South Pole]].  This was Byrd's last trip to Antarctica and marked the beginning of a permanent U.S. military presence in Antarctica.  Byrd spent only one week in the Antarctic and started his return to the United States on February 3, 1956.<ref name=\"FSIBZ\" />\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rear Admiral Richard E.

Byrd]]\nAdmiral Byrd died in his sleep of a heart ailment at the age of 68 on March 11, 1957, at his home at 7 Brimmer Street in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood in Boston.<ref name=\"ErQBg\" /> He was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\"lvGVc\" />\n\n==Memberships==\nByrd was an active [[Freemason]]. He was raised (became a Master Mason) in Federal Lodge No. 1, Washington, D.C. on March 19, 1921 and affiliated with [[Elisha Kane|Kane]] Lodge No. 454, New York City, September 18, 1928. He was a member of [[National Sojourners]] Chapter No. 3 at Washington. In 1930, Byrd was awarded a gold medal by Kane Lodge.<ref name=\"XeYPT\" /><ref name=\"tdIL8\" />\n\nIn 1931, Byrd became a compatriot of the Tennessee Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].  He was assigned state membership number 605 and national membership number 50430.  He received the Society's War Service Medal for his service during the First World War.\n\nHe was also a member of numerous other patriotic, scientific and charitable organizations including the [[Explorers Club]], the [[American Legion]] and the [[National Geographic Society]].\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Richard Byrd's Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Richard E. Byrd by [[Felix de Weldon]] at [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica.]]\n\nBy the time he died, Byrd had amassed twenty-two citations and special commendations, nine of which were for bravery and two for extraordinary heroism in saving the lives of others. In addition, he received the [[Medal of Honor]], the Silver [[Lifesaving Medal]], the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\nAdmiral Byrd is the only person to have three [[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City|ticker-tape parades in New York City]] (in 1926, 1927 and 1930) given in his honor.\n\nByrd was one of only four American military officers in history entitled to wear a medal with their own image on it. The others were Admiral [[George Dewey]], General [[John J. Pershing]] and Admiral [[William T. Sampson]]. As Byrd's image is on both the first and second [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal]]s, he was the only American entitled to wear two medals with his own image on them.\n\nHe was the 7th recipient of the prestigious [[Hubbard Medal]] awarded by the [[National Geographic Society]] for his flight to the North Pole.  Other recipients include [[Robert Peary]], [[Roald Amundsen]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]].\n\nByrd received numerous medals from non-governmental organizations in honor of his achievements.  These included the David Livingstone Centenary Medal of the [[American Geographical Society]], the Loczy Medal of the Hungarian Geographical Society, the Vega Medal of the Swedish Geographical Society and the [[Elisha Kent Kane]] Medal of the Philadelphia Geographical Society.\n\nIn 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made Byrd an [[List of Scouts#Honorary Scouts|Honorary Scout]], a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...\".<ref name=\"time29aug1927\" />[[File:Byrd Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Byrd Memorial on [[Mount Victoria, Wellington]], New Zealand]]\n\nAlso in 1927 the [[Richmond, Virginia|City of Richmond]] dedicated the Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field, now [[Richmond International Airport]], in [[Henrico County, Virginia]]. Byrd's [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] FC-2W2, NX8006, \"Stars And Stripes\" is on display at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]] located on the north side of the airport, on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1929 Byrd received the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America.  Also in 1929, he received the [[Langley Gold Medal]] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\n[[Lunar crater]] [[Byrd (lunar crater)|Byrd]] is named after him, as was the [[United States Navy]] dry cargo ship {{USNS|Richard E. Byrd|T-AKE-4}} and the now decommissioned [[Charles F. Adams class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class]] [[guided missile destroyer]] {{USS|Richard E. Byrd|DDG-23}}.\n\nIn [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]], Richard E. Byrd School was dedicated in 1931.\n\nOn March 31, 1934, during a regularly scheduled broadcast, Admiral Byrd was awarded the CBS Medal for Distinguished Contribution to Radio. Byrd's short wave relay broadcasts, from his second Antarctic expedition, established a new chapter of communication history. Byrd was the sixth individual to receive this award.<ref name=\"K6Qai\" />\n\nThe Institute of Polar Studies at The Ohio State University officially changed its name to the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) on January 21, 1987, after it acquired Admiral Richard E. Byrd's expeditionary records, personal papers and other memorabilia in 1985 from the estate of Marie A. Byrd, the late wife of Admiral Byrd. His papers served as the nucleus for establishment of the BPRC Polar Archival Program in 1990. In 1958 the Richard Byrd library, part of the [[Fairfax County Public Library]] system opened in [[Springfield, Virginia]].\n\nRichard E. Byrd Elementary School, a Department of Defense School located in Negishi (Yokohama, Japan)  opened on September 20, 1948. The name was changed to R.E. Byrd Elementary School on April 5, 1960.\n\nMemorials to Byrd can be found in two cities in New Zealand ([[Wellington]] and [[Dunedin]]). Byrd used New Zealand as his departure point for several of his Antarctic expeditions.\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Byrd's first flight over the South Pole was commemorated in a set of two postage stamps by [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] in 1979.\n\nThe long-range shortwave voice transmissions from Byrd's Antarctic expedition in 1934 was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2001.<ref name=\"mG3dc\" />\n{{clear}}\nAdmiral Richard E. Byrd Middle School, located in [[Frederick County, Virginia]], was opened in 2005, and is decorated with pictures and letters from Byrd's life and career.\n\nHe was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as an honorary member at the University of Virginia.<ref name=\"bUHQL\" />\n\nByrd was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the [[San Diego Air & Space Museum]] in 1968.<ref name=\"2B1EX\" />\n\nRichard E. Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley, California is named after Admiral Byrd. The school opened in its present location in 2008 after its original location was converted to Sun Valley High School.\n\n==Military awards==\nAdmiral Byrd was one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of the United States Navy.  He is, probably, the only individual to receive the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and the Silver Life Saving Medal.  He also was one of a very few individuals to receive all three Antarctic expedition medals issued for expeditions prior to the Second World War.\n\n===Decorations and medals===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" |[[File:Naval Aviator Badge.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" |{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Medal of Honor ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy Distinguished Service ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy and Marine Corps Commendation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Silver Lifesaving Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal (1928-1930).png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=SECOND BYRD ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION Medal.png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Antarctic Expedition Medal (1939-1941).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Mexican Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=7|type=service-star|ribbon=World War I Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=AnArcRib.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Legion Honneur Commandeur ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=DOM Order of Christopher Columbus ribbon bar.PNG|width=106}}\n|-\n|}\n\nNote -

After flying some distance beyond this point he returned to his base at Little America. This hazardous flight was made under extreme conditions of cold, over ranges and plateaus extending nine to ten thousand feet above sea level and beyond probable rescue of personnel had a forced landing occurred. Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, U.S.N, Retired, was in command of this flight, navigated the airplane, made the mandatory preparations for the flight, and through his untiring energy, superior leadership, and excellent judgment the flight was brought to a successful conclusion.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Distinguished Service Medal citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States, in demonstrating, by his courage and professional ability that heavier-than-air craft could in continuous flight travel to the North Pole and return.\n\nGeneral Orders: Letter Dated August 6, 1926\n</blockquote>\n\n===2nd Distinguished Service Medal citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States as Commanding Officer of the U.S. Antarctic Service. Rear Admiral Byrd did much toward the difficult task of organizing the expedition, which was accomplished in one fourth of the time generally necessary for such undertakings. In spite of a short operating season, he established two Antarctic bases 1,500 miles apart, where valuable scientific and economic investigations are now being carried on. With the {{USS|Bear}}, he penetrated unknown and dangerous seas where important discoveries were made; in addition to which he made four noteworthy flights, resulting in the discovery of new mountain ranges, islands, more than a hundred thousand square miles of area, a peninsula and 700 miles of hitherto unknown stretches of the Antarctic coast. The operations of the Antarctic Service have been a credit to the Government of the United States. His qualities of leadership and unselfish devotion to duty are in accordance with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States while in command of a Special Navy Mission to the Pacific from August 27, 1943, to December 5, 1943, when thirty-three islands of the Pacific were surveyed or investigated for the purpose of recommending air base sites of value to the United States for its defense or for the development of post-war civil aviation. In this service Admiral Byrd exercised fine leadership in gaining the united effort of civilian, Army, and Navy experts. He displayed courage, initiative, vision, and a high order of ability in obtain data and in submitting reports which will be of great present and future value to the National Defense and to the Government of the United States in the post-war period.\n\nAction Date: August 27 \u2013 December 5, 1943\n</blockquote>\n\n===2nd Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Confidential Advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations from March 26, 1942 to May 10, 1942, August 14, 1942 to August 26, 1943, and from December 6, 1943 to October 1, 1945. In the performance of his duty Rear Admiral Byrd served in the Navy Department and in various areas outside the continental limits of the United States, employed on special missions on the fighting fronts in Europe and the Pacific. In all assignments his thoroughness, attention to detail, keen discernment, professional judgment and zeal produced highly successful results.

He was a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest honor for valor given by the United States, and was a pioneering American aviator, polar explorer, and organizer of polar logistics. Aircraft flights in which he served as a [[navigator]] and expedition leader crossed the Atlantic Ocean, a segment of the Arctic Ocean, and a segment of the [[Antarctic Plateau]]. Byrd claimed that his expeditions had been the first to reach both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] by air. His claim to have reached the North Pole is disputed.<ref name=\"ElWZQ\" /> He is also known for discovering [[Mount Sidley]], the largest dormant volcano in Antarctica, in 1934.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Richard E. Byrd.svg|upright|thumb|left|Ancestral Coat of Arms of the Byrd family]]\n\n===Ancestry===\nByrd was born in Winchester, Virginia, the son of Esther Bolling (Flood) and [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.]] He was a descendant of one of the [[First Families of Virginia]]. His ancestors include planter [[John Rolfe]] and his wife [[Pocahontas]], [[William Byrd II]] of [[Westover Plantation]], who established [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and [[Robert Carter I|Robert \"King\" Carter]], a colonial governor. He was the brother of [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry F. Byrd]], a dominant figure in the [[Virginia]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from the 1920s until the 1960s; [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.|their father]] served as [[Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates|Speaker]] of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] for a time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Marriage===\nOn January 20, 1915, Richard married Marie Donaldson Ames (d. 1974). He would later name a region of Antarctic land he discovered \"[[Marie Byrd Land]]\" after her. They had four children \u2013 [[Richard Evelyn Byrd III]], Evelyn Bolling Byrd Clarke, Katharine Agnes Byrd Breyer, and Helen Byrd Stabler. By late 1924, the Byrd family moved into a large brownstone house at 9 Brimmer Street in Boston's fashionable [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood<ref name=\":2\" /> that had been purchased by Marie's father, a wealthy industrialist.<ref name=\"zn5uY\" />\n\n===Personal life===\n\nByrd was friends with [[Edsel Ford]] and his father [[Henry Ford]], whose admiration of his polar exploits helped to gain Byrd sponsorship and financing for his various polar expeditions from the Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"5NUPW\" />\n\n==Education and early naval career==\nByrd attended the [[Virginia Military Institute]] for two years and spent one year at the [[University of Virginia]] before financial circumstances inspired his transfer to the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he was appointed as a [[Midshipman|midshipman]] on May 28, 1908.<ref name=\"va3U5\" />   While at the Naval Academy, he suffered two injuries to this right ankle (one was by playing football and the other was while dismounting gymnastic rings during a competition).  Although he was allowed to remain at the Academy, his injuries eventually led to his forced retirement from the Navy in 1916.  \n\nOn June 8, 1912, Byrd graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the United States Navy. On July 14, 1912, he was assigned to the battleship [[USS Wyoming (BB-32)|USS ''Wyoming'']].  During service in the Caribbean Sea, Byrd received his first letter of commendation, and later a [[Lifesaving Medal|Silver Lifesaving Medal]], for twice plunging fully clothed to the rescue of a sailor who had fallen overboard.  In April 1914 he transferred to the armored cruiser [[USS Washington (ACR-11)|USS ''Washington'']] and served in Mexican waters in June following the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]] in April.\n\nHis next assignment was to the gunboat [[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|USS ''Dolphin'']], which also served as the yacht of the Secretary of the Navy.  This assignment brought Byrd into contact with high-ranking officials and dignitaries including then [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on June 8, 1915.  During Byrd's assignment to ''Dolphin'' she was commanded by future [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]], who served as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"eitvO\" />   Byrd's last assignment before forced retirement was to the presidential yacht [[USS Mayflower (PY-1)|USS ''Mayflower'']].\n\nOn March 15, 1916, Byrd, much to his frustration, was medically retired on three quarters pay for an ankle injury he suffered on board ''Mayflower''.  Shortly afterwards, he was assigned as the Inspector and Instructor for the [[Rhode Island Naval Militia]] in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=\"fmg93\" />  On December 14, 1916, he was commissioned as a commander in the Rhode Island Naval Militia.<ref name=\"CLCLA\" />  In this position he was commended by Brigadier General [[Charles Wheaton Abbot Jr.|Charles W. Abbot]], the Adjutant General of Rhode Island, with making great strides in improving the efficiency of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  On April 25, 1928, by act of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he was promoted to captain in the Rhode Island Naval Militia in recognition of his flight to the North Pole in 1926.<ref name=\"AVXRl\" />\n\n==First World War==\n[[File:Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s (exbt-iceberg-47).jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s]]\nShortly after the entry of the United States into the First World War in April 1917, Byrd oversaw the mobilization of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  He was then recalled to active duty and was assigned to the Office of Naval Operations and served in a desk job as secretary and organizer of the Navy Department Commission on Training Camps.  In the autumn of 1917 he was sent naval aviation school at [[Pensacola Naval Air Station|Pensacola, Florida]].  He qualified as a Naval Aviator (number 608) in June 1918.<ref name=\"jYcqJ\" />  He then commanded naval air forces at [[Naval Air Station Halifax]] in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada from July 1918 until the armistice in November.  In that assignment he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant and the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />\n\nFor his services during the war, he received a letter of commendation from Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], which was after World War II converted to a [[Navy Commendation Medal]].\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the war, Byrd volunteered to be a crewmember in the U.S. Navy's 1919 aerial [[Transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] crossing.   This mission was historic as it was the first time the Atlantic Ocean would by crossed by an aircraft.   It was decided that only men who had not served overseas would be allowed on the mission.  Unfortunately for Byrd, his tour of duty in New Foundland was considered overseas service.  Byrd was, however, able to make a valuable contribution as his expertise in aerial navigation resulted in his appointment to plan the flight path of the mission.  Of the three [[flying boats]] (NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4) that started from New Foundland, only Lieutenant Commander [[Albert Cushing Read|Albert Read]]'s [[NC-4]] completed the trip on May 18, 1919, achieving the first ever transatlantic flight.<ref name=\"oqTJ3\" />\n\nIn 1921 Byrd volunteered to attempt a solo non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean - prefiguring [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s historic flight by six years.  Byrd's ambition was dashed by then acting [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], who felt the risks outweighed the potential rewards.  Byrd was then assigned to the ill fated dirigible [[ZR-2|''ZR-2'']] (formerly known by the British designation of ''R-38'').  As fate would have it, Byrd missed his train to take him to the airship on August 24, 1921.  The airship broke apart in midair, killing 44 of 49 crewmembers on board.  Byrd lost several friends in the accident and was involved in the subsequent recovery operations and investigation.  The accident affected him deeply and inspired him to make safety a top priority in all of his future expeditions.\n\nDue to reductions in the Navy after the First World War, Byrd reverted to the rank of lieutenant at the end of 1921.\n\nDuring the summer of 1923 then Lieutenant Byrd and a group of volunteer Navy veterans of the First World War helped found the [[Naval Air Station Squantum|Naval Reserve Air Station]] (NRAS) at [[Squantum Point]] near Boston, using an unused First World War seaplane hangar which had remained more-or-less intact after the [[Victory Destroyer Plant]] shipyard was built on the site. NRAS Squantum was commissioned on August 15, 1923, and is considered to have been the first air base in the Naval Reserve program.<ref name=\"Rpfen\" />\n\nByrd commanded the aviation unit of the arctic expedition to North Greenland led by [[Donald B. MacMillan]] from June to October 1925.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />  It was during this expedition that Byrd made the acquaintance of Navy Chief Aviation Pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] and Norwegian pilot [[Bernt Balchen]].  Bennett would serve as his pilot in his flight to the North Pole the next year.  Balchen, who's knowledge of arctic flight operations proved invaluable, would be the primary pilot on Byrd's flight to the South Pole in 1929.\n\n{{anchor|1926 North Pole flight}}\n\n==1926 North Pole flight==\n[[File:Fokker F.VII plane of Byrd-Bennett in flight in 1926.jpg|thumb|right|The Fokker F.VII of Byrd and Bennett in flight.]]\nOn May 9, 1926, Byrd and Navy [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief Aviation Pilot]] [[Floyd Bennett]] attempted a flight over the North Pole in a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VIIa/3m]] Tri-motor monoplane named ''Josephine Ford'' after the daughter of [[Ford Motor Company]] president [[Edsel Ford]], who helped finance the expedition. The flight left from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) and returned to its take-off airfield, lasting fifteen hours and fifty-seven minutes, including 13 minutes spent circling at their Farthest North.<ref name=\":2\" /> Byrd and Bennett claimed to have reached the North Pole, a distance of 1,535 miles (1,335 [[nautical mile]]s).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhen he returned to the United States from the Arctic, Byrd became a national hero. Congress passed a special act on December 21, 1926, promoting him to the rank of commander and awarding both him and Floyd Bennett the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref name=\"bJpsT\" /> Bennett was promoted to the [[warrant officer]] rank of Machinist. Byrd and Bennett were presented with [[Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor|Tiffany Cross]] versions of the Medal of Honor on March 5, 1927 at the [[White House]] by President [[Calvin Coolidge]].<ref name=\"b3RS8\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n[[File:Fokker FVIIa3m wiki.jpg|thumb|left|The Fokker FVIIa/3M \u2013 \"Josephine Ford\", on display at [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] ]]\nSince 1926, there have been doubts raised, defenses made, and heated controversy over whether or not Byrd actually reached the North Pole. In 1958, [[Norwegian-American]] aviator and explorer [[Bernt Balchen]] cast doubt on Byrd's claim on the basis of his knowledge of the airplane's speed.<ref name=\"gookz\" /> Balchen claimed that Bennett had confessed to him months after the flight that he and Byrd had not reached the pole.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Nash\" /> Bennett died on April 25, 1928, during a flight to rescue downed aviators in Greenland. However, Bennett had started a memoir, given numerous interviews, and wrote an article for an aviation magazine about the flight before his death that all confirmed Byrd's version of the flight.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe 1996 release of Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926 flight revealed erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official report to the National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19\u00b025'30\", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18\u00b018'18\".<ref name=\"vLD1b\" /> On the basis of this and other data in the diary, [[Dennis Rawlins]] concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole.<ref name=\"6gYQw\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccepting that the conflicting data in the typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward [[ground speed]]s greater than the flight's eighty-five mph [[airspeed]], a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving [[anticyclone]] that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data<ref name=\"fukGs\" /><ref name=\"fC461\" />). This suggestion has been challenged by [[Dennis Rawlins]] who adds that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1\", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIf Byrd and Bennett did not reach the North Pole, then the first flight over the Pole occurred a few days later, on May 12, 1926, with the flight of the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' that flew from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) to [[Alaska]] nonstop with a crew including [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Umberto Nobile]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and [[Lincoln Ellsworth]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"kAWPY\" />\n\n==1927 Trans-Atlantic flight==\n[[File:Lt com byrd and aircraft.jpg|right|thumb|Lt. Com. Byrd and aircraft]]\nIn 1927, Byrd announced he had the backing of the [[American Trans-Oceanic Company]], which had been established in 1914 by department-store magnate [[Rodman Wanamaker]] for the purpose of building aircraft to complete non-stop flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Byrd was one of several aviators who attempted to win the [[Orteig Prize]] in 1927 for making the first nonstop flight between the United States and France.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nOnce again Byrd named Floyd Bennett as his chief pilot, with Norwegian [[Bernt Balchen]], [[Bert Acosta]], and Lieutenant [[George Otto Noville|George Noville]] as other crewmembers. During a practice takeoff with Tony Fokker at the controls and Bennett in the co-pilot seat, the [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker Trimotor]] airplane, ''[[America (airplane)|America]]'', crashed, severely injuring Bennett and slightly injuring Byrd. As the plane was being repaired, [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize by completing his historic flight on May 21, 1927. (Coincidentally, in 1925, then [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service Reserve Corps]] Lieutenant Charles Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Byrd's North Pole expedition, but, apparently, his bid came too late.)<ref name=\"Berg\" />\n\nByrd continued with his quest to cross the Atlantic non-stop, naming Balchen to replace Bennett, who had not yet fully recovered from his injuries, as chief pilot. Byrd, Balchen, Acosta, and Noville flew from Roosevelt Field [[East Garden City, New York]] in the ''America'' on June 29, 1927.  On board was mail from the US Postal Service to demonstrate the practicality of aircraft.  Arriving over France the next day, they were prevented from landing in Paris by cloud cover; they returned to the coast of [[Normandy]] and crash-landed near the beach at [[Ver-sur-Mer]] (known as [[Gold Beach]] during the [[Normandy Invasion]] on June 6, 1944) without fatalities on July 1, 1927.<ref name=\"ucqIu\" />  In France, Byrd and his crew were received as heroes and Byrd was invested as an Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]] by Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincare]] on July 6.<ref name=\"6SieQ\" />\n\nAfter their return to the United States, an elaborate dinner in their honor in New York City on July 19.  Byrd and Noville were awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] by Secretary of the Navy [[Curtis D. Wilbur]] at the dinner.<ref name=\"iNgXi\" /> Acosta and Balchen did not receive the Distinguished Flying Cross because, at that time, it could only be awarded to members of the armed services and not to civilians.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nByrd wrote an article for the August 1927 edition of ''Popular Science Monthly'' in which he accurately predicted that while specially modified aircraft with one to three crewmen would fly the Atlantic non-stop, it would be another 20 years before it would be realized on a commercial scale.<ref name=\"mheH3\" />\n\n==Early Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===First Antarctic expedition (1928\u20131930)===\n[[File:Remains of Fokker aircraft, First Byrd Expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Remains of Fokker aircraft in the [[Rockefeller Mountains]], Antarctica in 1993]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09158, Expeditionsschiff Byrds.jpg|thumb|left|Byrd's expedition]]\nIn 1928, Byrd began his [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal|first expedition]] to the [[Antarctic]] involving two ships and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was the [[City of New York (1885 ship)|''City of New York'']] (a Norwegian sealing ship previously named ''Samson'' that had come into fame as a ship some claimed was in the vicinity of the [[RMS Titanic]] when the latter was sinking) and the [[Vamar Shipwreck Site|''Eleanor Bolling'']] (named after Byrd's mother); a [[Ford Trimotor]] airplane called the ''[[Floyd Bennett]]'' (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions) flown by [[Dean Smith (American pioneer pilot)#Byrd expedition|Dean Smith]]; a [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] [[Fairchild FC-2|FC-2W2]], NX8006, built 1928, named \"Stars And Stripes\" (now displayed at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]], on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]]); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the ''Virginia'' (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named \"[[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]]\" was constructed on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] and scientific expeditions by [[snowshoe]], [[dog-sled]], [[snowmobile]], and [[airplane]] began.<ref name=\":6\" />   In order to increase the interest of youth in arctic exploration, a 19-year-old American [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], [[Paul Siple|Paul Allman Siple]], was chosen to accompany the expedition.  Siple would go on to earn an doctorate degree and was probably the only person, other than Byrd himself, to participate in all five of Byrd's Antarctic expeditions.\n\nPhotographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on November 28, 1929, the first flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot [[Bernt Balchen]], co-pilot/radioman [[Harold June]], and photographer [[Ashley Chadbourne McKinley|Ashley McKinley]], flew the ''Floyd Bennett'' to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau, but they were ultimately successful.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-0893e7.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Byrd (circa 1955)]]\n\nAs a result of his acheivement, Byrd was promoted to the rank of [[rear admiral]] by a special act of Congress on December 21, 1929. As he was only 41 years old at the time, this promotion made Byrd the youngest admiral in the history of the United States Navy.<ref name=\"1GPaH\" />  By way of comparison, none of his Annapolis classmates would become admirals until 1942, after 30 years of commissioned service.  He is one of only three persons, one being Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] and the other being arctic explorer [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]], to have been promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy without having first held the rank of captain.\n\nAfter a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on June 18, 1930.  Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the [[American Geographical Society]]. This was also seen in the film ''[[With Byrd at the South Pole]]'' (1930) which covered his trip there.\n\nByrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931\u20131935) of [[Pi Gamma Mu]], the international honor society in the social sciences. He carried the Society's flag during his first Antarctic expedition to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences.<ref name=\"Richard E. Byrd 1888-1957\" /><ref name=\"Byrd Antarctic Expedition III\" />\n\nIn order to finance and gain both political and public support for his expeditions, Byrd actively cultivated relationships with many powerful individuals.  These individuals included, but were not limited to, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Edsel Ford]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and [[Vincent Astor]].  As a token of his gratitude, Byrd named geographic features in the Antarctic after his supporters.\n\n===Second Antarctic expedition===\nOn his second expedition in 1934, Byrd spent five winter months alone operating a [[meteorology|meteorological]] station, Advance Base, from which he narrowly escaped with his life after suffering [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning from a poorly ventilated stove. Unusual radio transmissions from Byrd finally began to alarm the men at the base camp, who then attempted to go to Advance Base. The first two trips were failures due to darkness, snow, and mechanical troubles. Finally, [[Thomas Poulter]], [[E.J. Demas]], and [[Amory Waite]] arrived at Advance Base, where they found Byrd in poor physical health. The men remained at Advance Base until October 12 when an airplane from the base camp picked up Dr. Poulter and Byrd. The rest of the men returned to base camp with the tractor.<ref name=\":2\" /> This expedition is described by Byrd in his autobiography ''Alone''. It is also commemorated in a U.S. postage stamp issued at the time, and a considerable amount of mail using it was sent from Byrd's base at [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]].\n\nA CBS radio station, KFZ,  was set up on the base camp ship, the [[USS Bear|''Bear of Oakland'']] and ''The Adventures of Admiral Byrd'' were short waved to Buenos Aires then relayed to New York.<ref name=\"zw56a\" />\n\nIn late 1938 Byrd visited Hamburg and was invited to participate in the 1938/1939 German \"[[New Swabia|Neuschwabenland]]\" Antarctic Expedition, but declined. (Although Germany was not at war with the United States at this time, Adolf Hitler had been serving as [[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer of the German Reich]] since 1934 and invaded Poland the next year.)\n\n===Antarctic Service Expedition (1939\u20131940)===\n{{main|United States Antarctic Service Expedition}}\nByrd's [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition|third expedition]] was the first one financed and conducted by the United States Government. The project included extensive studies of geology, biology, meteorology and exploration.  The innovative [[Antarctic Snow Cruiser]] was brought with the expedition but broke down shortly after arriving.  \n\nWithin a few months, in March 1940, Byrd was recalled to active duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The expedition continued in Antarctica without him until the lasts of its participants left Antarctica on March 22, 1941.\n\n==World War II==\nAs a senior officer in the United States Navy, Byrd served on active duty during World War II.  He was recalled on active duty on March 26, 1942 and served as the confidential advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations (i.e. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]]). From 1942 to 1945 he joined the South Pacific Island Base Inspection Board, which had important missions to the Pacific, including surveys of remote islands for airfields. On one assignment he visited the fighting front in Europe.\n\nOn February 10, 1945, Byrd received the [[Order of Christopher Columbus]] from the government of the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name=\"QBmaR\" /> Byrd was present at the [[Japanese surrender]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on September 2, 1945.   He was released from active duty on October 1, 1945.\n\nIn recognition of his service during World War II, Byrd was twice awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Later Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===Operation Highjump (1946\u20131947)===\n[[File:Alone (Richard Byrd autobiography - cover art).png|right|thumb|upright|Cover of Byrd's autobiography]]\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-6854e2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Admiral Byrd during ''Operation Deep Freeze&nbsp;I'' (Dec.&nbsp;1955)]]\nIn 1946, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] appointed Byrd as officer in charge of Antarctic Developments Project.  Byrd's fourth Antarctic expedition was codenamed [[Operation Highjump]].<ref name=\":2\" />  It was the largest Antarctic expedition to date and was expected to last six to eight months.\n\nThe expedition was supported by a large naval force (designated Task Force 68), commanded by Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Cruzen]].  There were thirteen US Navy support ships (besides the flagship {{USS|Mount Olympus|AGC-8|6}} and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|6}}), six helicopters, six flying boats, two seaplane tenders, and fifteen other aircraft. The total number of personnel involved was over 4,000.\n\nThe armada arrived in the Ross Sea on December 31, 1946, and made aerial explorations of an area half the size of the United States, recording ten new mountain ranges. The major area covered was the eastern coastline of Antarctica from 150 degrees east to the Greenwich meridian.\n\nAdmiral Byrd was interviewed by Lee van Atta of [[International News Service]] aboard the expedition's command ship [[USS Mount Olympus (AGC-8)|USS Mount Olympus]], in which he discussed the lessons learned from the operation. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', and read in part as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking&nbsp;\u2013 recalled the admiral \u2013 is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.<ref name=\"SrP7R\" /><ref name=\"wVU0G\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1948 the U.S. Navy produced a documentary about Operation Highjump named ''[[The Secret Land]]''.  The film shows live action footage of the operation along with a few re-enacted scenes.  It won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.\n\nOn December 8, 1954, Byrd appeared on the television show Longines Chronoscope. He was interviewed by Larry LeSueur and Kenneth Crawford about his Antarctic voyages, and claimed that Antarctica, in the future, would become the most important place in the world for science.<ref name=\"d7E2H\" />\n\n===Operation Deep Freeze I (1955\u20131956)===\nAs part of the multinational collaboration for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) 1957\u201358, Byrd commanded the U.S. Navy [[Operation Deep Freeze|Operation Deep Freeze I]] in 1955\u201356 which established permanent Antarctic bases at [[McMurdo Sound]], the [[Bay of Whales]], and the [[South Pole]].  This was Byrd's last trip to Antarctica and marked the beginning of a permanent U.S. military presence in Antarctica.  Byrd spent only one week in the Antarctic and started his return to the United States on February 3, 1956.<ref name=\"FSIBZ\" />\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd (18680437653).jpg|thumb|Grave of Rear Admiral Richard E.

He was raised (became a Master Mason) in Federal Lodge No. 1, Washington, D.C. on March 19, 1921 and affiliated with [[Elisha Kane|Kane]] Lodge No. 454, New York City, September 18, 1928. He was a member of [[National Sojourners]] Chapter No. 3 at Washington. In 1930, Byrd was awarded a gold medal by Kane Lodge.<ref name=\"XeYPT\" /><ref name=\"tdIL8\" />\n\nIn 1931, Byrd became a compatriot of the Tennessee Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].  He was assigned state membership number 605 and national membership number 50430.  He received the Society's War Service Medal for his service during the First World War.\n\nHe was also a member of numerous other patriotic, scientific and charitable organizations including the [[Explorers Club]], the [[American Legion]] and the [[National Geographic Society]].\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Richard Byrd's Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Richard E. Byrd by [[Felix de Weldon]] at [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica.]]\n\nBy the time he died, Byrd had amassed twenty-two citations and special commendations, nine of which were for bravery and two for extraordinary heroism in saving the lives of others. In addition, he received the [[Medal of Honor]], the Silver [[Lifesaving Medal]], the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\nAdmiral Byrd is the only person to have three [[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City|ticker-tape parades in New York City]] (in 1926, 1927 and 1930) given in his honor.\n\nByrd was one of only four American military officers in history entitled to wear a medal with their own image on it. The others were Admiral [[George Dewey]], General [[John J. Pershing]] and Admiral [[William T. Sampson]]. As Byrd's image is on both the first and second [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal]]s, he was the only American entitled to wear two medals with his own image on them.\n\nHe was the 7th recipient of the prestigious [[Hubbard Medal]] awarded by the [[National Geographic Society]] for his flight to the North Pole.  Other recipients include [[Robert Peary]], [[Roald Amundsen]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]].\n\nByrd received numerous medals from non-governmental organizations in honor of his achievements.  These included the David Livingstone Centenary Medal of the [[American Geographical Society]], the Loczy Medal of the Hungarian Geographical Society, the Vega Medal of the Swedish Geographical Society and the [[Elisha Kent Kane]] Medal of the Philadelphia Geographical Society.\n\nIn 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made Byrd an [[List of Scouts#Honorary Scouts|Honorary Scout]], a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...\".<ref name=\"time29aug1927\" />[[File:Byrd Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Byrd Memorial on [[Mount Victoria, Wellington]], New Zealand]]\n\nAlso in 1927 the [[Richmond, Virginia|City of Richmond]] dedicated the Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field, now [[Richmond International Airport]], in [[Henrico County, Virginia]]. Byrd's [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] FC-2W2, NX8006, \"Stars And Stripes\" is on display at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]] located on the north side of the airport, on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1929 Byrd received the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America.  Also in 1929, he received the [[Langley Gold Medal]] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\n[[Lunar crater]] [[Byrd (lunar crater)|Byrd]] is named after him, as was the [[United States Navy]] dry cargo ship {{USNS|Richard E. Byrd|T-AKE-4}} and the now decommissioned [[Charles F. Adams class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class]] [[guided missile destroyer]] {{USS|Richard E. Byrd|DDG-23}}.\n\nIn [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]], Richard E. Byrd School was dedicated in 1931.\n\nOn March 31, 1934, during a regularly scheduled broadcast, Admiral Byrd was awarded the CBS Medal for Distinguished Contribution to Radio. Byrd's short wave relay broadcasts, from his second Antarctic expedition, established a new chapter of communication history. Byrd was the sixth individual to receive this award.<ref name=\"K6Qai\" />\n\nThe Institute of Polar Studies at The Ohio State University officially changed its name to the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) on January 21, 1987, after it acquired Admiral Richard E. Byrd's expeditionary records, personal papers and other memorabilia in 1985 from the estate of Marie A. Byrd, the late wife of Admiral Byrd. His papers served as the nucleus for establishment of the BPRC Polar Archival Program in 1990. In 1958 the Richard Byrd library, part of the [[Fairfax County Public Library]] system opened in [[Springfield, Virginia]].\n\nRichard E. Byrd Elementary School, a Department of Defense School located in Negishi (Yokohama, Japan)  opened on September 20, 1948. The name was changed to R.E. Byrd Elementary School on April 5, 1960.\n\nMemorials to Byrd can be found in two cities in New Zealand ([[Wellington]] and [[Dunedin]]). Byrd used New Zealand as his departure point for several of his Antarctic expeditions.\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Byrd's first flight over the South Pole was commemorated in a set of two postage stamps by [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] in 1979.\n\nThe long-range shortwave voice transmissions from Byrd's Antarctic expedition in 1934 was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2001.<ref name=\"mG3dc\" />\n{{clear}}\nAdmiral Richard E. Byrd Middle School, located in [[Frederick County, Virginia]], was opened in 2005, and is decorated with pictures and letters from Byrd's life and career.\n\nHe was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as an honorary member at the University of Virginia.<ref name=\"bUHQL\" />\n\nByrd was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the [[San Diego Air & Space Museum]] in 1968.<ref name=\"2B1EX\" />\n\nRichard E. Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley, California is named after Admiral Byrd. The school opened in its present location in 2008 after its original location was converted to Sun Valley High School.\n\n==Military awards==\nAdmiral Byrd was one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of the United States Navy.  He is, probably, the only individual to receive the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and the Silver Life Saving Medal.  He also was one of a very few individuals to receive all three Antarctic expedition medals issued for expeditions prior to the Second World War.\n\n===Decorations and medals===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" |[[File:Naval Aviator Badge.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" |{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Medal of Honor ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy Distinguished Service ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy and Marine Corps Commendation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Silver Lifesaving Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal (1928-1930).png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=SECOND BYRD ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION Medal.png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Antarctic Expedition Medal (1939-1941).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Mexican Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=7|type=service-star|ribbon=World War I Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=AnArcRib.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Legion Honneur Commandeur ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=DOM Order of Christopher Columbus ribbon bar.PNG|width=106}}\n|-\n|}\n\nNote -

Appointed from: Virginia.\n;Citation:\n<blockquote>For distinguishing himself conspicuously by courage and intrepidity at the risk of his life, in demonstrating that it is possible for aircraft to travel in continuous flight from a now inhabited portion of the earth over the North Pole and return.</blockquote>\n\nByrd, along with Machinist [[Floyd Bennett]], was presented with the Medal of Honor by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] on March 5, 1927.\n\n===Navy Cross citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition I, in that on November 28, 1929 he took off in his \"Floyd Bennett\" from the Expedition's base at Little America, Antarctica and, after a flight made under the most difficult conditions he reached the South Pole on November 29, 1929. After flying some distance beyond this point he returned to his base at Little America. This hazardous flight was made under extreme conditions of cold, over ranges and plateaus extending nine to ten thousand feet above sea level and beyond probable rescue of personnel had a forced landing occurred. Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, U.S.N, Retired, was in command of this flight, navigated the airplane, made the mandatory preparations for the flight, and through his untiring energy, superior leadership, and excellent judgment the flight was brought to a successful conclusion.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Distinguished Service Medal citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States, in demonstrating, by his courage and professional ability that heavier-than-air craft could in continuous flight travel to the North Pole and return.\n\nGeneral Orders: Letter Dated August 6, 1926\n</blockquote>\n\n===2nd Distinguished Service Medal citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States as Commanding Officer of the U.S. Antarctic Service. Rear Admiral Byrd did much toward the difficult task of organizing the expedition, which was accomplished in one fourth of the time generally necessary for such undertakings. In spite of a short operating season, he established two Antarctic bases 1,500 miles apart, where valuable scientific and economic investigations are now being carried on. With the {{USS|Bear}}, he penetrated unknown and dangerous seas where important discoveries were made; in addition to which he made four noteworthy flights, resulting in the discovery of new mountain ranges, islands, more than a hundred thousand square miles of area, a peninsula and 700 miles of hitherto unknown stretches of the Antarctic coast. The operations of the Antarctic Service have been a credit to the Government of the United States. His qualities of leadership and unselfish devotion to duty are in accordance with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States while in command of a Special Navy Mission to the Pacific from August 27, 1943, to December 5, 1943, when thirty-three islands of the Pacific were surveyed or investigated for the purpose of recommending air base sites of value to the United States for its defense or for the development of post-war civil aviation. In this service Admiral Byrd exercised fine leadership in gaining the united effort of civilian, Army, and Navy experts. He displayed courage, initiative, vision, and a high order of ability in obtain data and in submitting reports which will be of great present and future value to the National Defense and to the Government of the United States in the post-war period.\n\nAction Date: August 27 \u2013 December 5, 1943\n</blockquote>\n\n===2nd Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Confidential Advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations from March 26, 1942 to May 10, 1942, August 14, 1942 to August 26, 1943, and from December 6, 1943 to October 1, 1945. In the performance of his duty Rear Admiral Byrd served in the Navy Department and in various areas outside the continental limits of the United States, employed on special missions on the fighting fronts in Europe and the Pacific. In all assignments his thoroughness, attention to detail, keen discernment, professional judgment and zeal produced highly successful results. His wise counsel, sound advice and foresight in planning constituted a material contribution to the war effort and to the success of the United States Navy. The performance of duty of Rear Admiral Byrd was at all times in keeping with the highest traditions and reflected credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service.\n\nGeneral Orders: Board Serial 176P00 (February 4, 1946)\n\nAction Date: March 26, 1942 \u2013 October 1, 1945\n</blockquote>\n\n===Distinguished Flying Cross citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight; in recognition of his courage, resourcefulness and skill as Commander of the expedition which flew the airplane \"America\" from New York City to France from June 29 to July 1, 1927, across the Atlantic Ocean under extremely adverse weather conditions which made a landing in Paris impossible; and finally for his discernment and courage in directing his plane to a landing at Ver sur Mer, France, without serious injury to his personnel, after a flight of 39 hours and 56 minutes.\n\nAction Date: June 29 \u2013 July 1, 1927\n</blockquote>\n\n===Letter of Commendation===\n{{quote|He rendered valuable service as Secretary and Organizer of the Navy Department Commission on Training Camps, and trained men in aviation in the ground school in Pensacola, and in charge of rescue parties and afterwards in charge of air forces in Canada.|Awarded for service from 1917 to 1918 during World War I.<ref name=\"pIJsV\" />}}\n\n==Dates of rank==\n[[File:Navyacademylogo.jpg|50px]] [[United States Naval Academy]] [[Midshipman]] \u2013 May 28, 1908 (Class of 1912)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n![[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]]\n![[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]]\n![[Lieutenant]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US Navy O1 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US Navy O2 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US Navy O3 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!June 8, 1912\n!June 8, 1915<br>Retired on March 15, 1916\n!September 2, 1918\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n![[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]]\n![[Commander (United States)|Commander]]\n![[Rear Admiral (upper half)|Rear Admiral]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US Navy O4 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US Navy O5 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US Navy O8 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!September 21, 1918<br>(temporary)<br>Revoked on December 31, 1921<br>February 10, 1925<br>(permanent)\n!May 9, 1926<br>By act of Congress <br>on December 21, 1926\n!December 21, 1929<br>By act of Congress\n|}\n<ref name=\"idz6u\" /><ref name=\"BXenH\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Adventurers' Club of New York]]\n* [[Ford Ranges]]\n* [[Laurence McKinley Gould]]\n* [[List of Antarctic expeditions]]\n* [[List of Freemasons]]\n* [[List of Medal of Honor recipients during peacetime]]\n* [[Sons of the American Revolution]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\">Who's Who in America. 1956\u201357. p. 386.</ref>\n<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = Race to the Top of the World|last = Bart|first = Sheldon|publisher = Regnery|year = 2013|isbn = 9781621571803|location = Washington DC|pages = 359, 365\u201367|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gG2DAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Nash\">{{Cite book |title=The Last Explorer|author=Nash, Simon |publisher=Hodder |year=2005 |pages=149}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal |accessdate = July 13, 2007|url = http://www.dioi.org/vols/wa0.pdf|title = Byrd's Heroic 1926 Flight & Its Faked Last Leg|author = Rawlins, Dennis|date = January 2000|journal = DIO, the International Journal of Scientific History|volume = 10|pages = 2\u2013106; see pp 69\u201376; also pp. 54, 84\u201388, 99, 105}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/infosheets/21.html|title = Concise chronology of approach to the poles|date = |accessdate = December 3, 2015|website = Scott Polar Research Institute|publisher = University of Cambridge|last = |first =}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Berg\">{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.
