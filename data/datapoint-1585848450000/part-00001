He participated in [[Central China]] campaigns and later led [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']] in both main carrier battles during [[Solomon Islands Campaign]], where he and his pilot, Kiyoto Furuta (\u53e4\u7530 \u6e05\u4eba), scored bomb hits on [[United States Navy]] (USN) carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' on two separate occasions.\n\n==Early career==\nKeiichi Arima enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1933 and graduated from 64th class in March 1937. He received his commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in March 1938. In August of the same year he was sent for an aerial training program to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] and completed it in March 1939. He then was chosen for advanced aerial training courses at [[Yokosuka]] NAS near Tokyo and Saeki NAS on [[Kyushu]], where he specialized in aerial reconnaissance. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in June 1939.\n\nHe was assigned as a junior flight division leader (junior [[buntaich\u014d]]) to the 12th Air Group, which was stationed in Central China. His unit flew [[Aichi D1A]] dive bombers out of the bases in [[Anqing]], [[Jiujiang]], and [[Hankou]] to support ground operations in the area. Later on, the unit switched to [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers and participated in [[Bombing of Chongqing]], which was the capital of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalists]] at that time. He was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in May 1941.\n\nLieutenant Arima was transferred to the carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'' in the end of 1940 and was assigned as a junior division leader (junior [[buntaich\u014d]]) of dive-bomber squadron. After six months, he was reassigned to [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]] NAS in [[Mie Prefecture]], where he served as an instructor when [[Empire of Japan]] entered the war with [[United States of America]].\n\n==Pacific War==\nIn May 1942, Lieutenant Arima was transferred to the carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Sh\u014dkaku]]'' and was assigned as a senior flight division leader (senior [[buntaich\u014d]]) of dive-bomber squadron.\n\nIn late August 1942 ''Sh\u014dkaku'' participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. During the attack on USN carriers, Lieutenant Arima was part of the first strike wave that consisted of 27 D3A dive bombers and 10 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] fighters and was under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Mamoru Seki]]. Arima led one of the three divisions (ch\u016btai), with nine dive bombers under his command. He was in the observer seat of D3A, while his aircraft was piloted by [[Petty officer first class|Petty Officer First Class]] Kiyoto Furuta. USN Combat Air Patrol (CAP) of [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters intercepted the formation of dive bombers, however Arima's division managed to escape into [[cumulonimbus]] clouds and approached US carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' unharmed. The division made dive-bombing attacks on ''Enterprise'' and released their bombs around an altitude of 500 meters and scored a hit that penetrated the starboard forward corner of her number 3 elevator aft. One of the 250 kilogram [[Armor-piercing shell|semi-AP]] bomb sliced through to the third deck before detonating in the chief's quarters. After the attack, Arima remained north-west of the burning ''Enterprise'' to wait for friendly Zero fighters in order to led them back to the Japanese carriers. However, he encountered several US aircraft that started to case his D3A. He and his pilot evaded the attackers by flying very close to the sea surface and eventually made it back to ''Sh\u014dkaku''.\n\nIn late October 1942, ''Sh\u014dkaku'' was again dispatched to Solomon Islands to support the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] ground assault on [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], Lieutenant Arima's division was part of the second strike wave that consisted of 27 D3A dive bombers and 5 A6M Zero fighters, which was again under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki. The Zero fighters were led by Lieutenant [[Hideki Shingo|Hideki Shing\u014d]], the fighter squadron leader of ''Sh\u014dkaku''. Arima and his pilot attacked ''Enterprise'' from astern and released the bomb at an altitude of between 450 and 500 meters and scored a hit. Their 250 kilogram semi-AP bomb penetrated the center of the flight deck, around six meters from the forward edge, and detonated inside the carrier causing fires. They did not encounter any CAP on the way out and they climbed to 6000 meters, where Arima observed a dense smoke coming from ''Enterprise''. However, his commander ([[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]) and ''Sh\u014dkaku'' dive bomber squadron leader, Mamoru Seki, was killed during the attack on ''Enterprise''. Since a simultaneous USN strike damaged the flight deck of ''Sh\u014dkaku'', Arima's D3A landed on ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]''.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Lieutenant Arima was transferred to [[Usa, \u014cita|Usa]] NAS in [[\u014cita Prefecture]] on Kyushu and served as an instructor. He was then transferred to [[Yokosuka]] NAS, where he served as a flight commander. There he was involved in developing communication equipment and radar, and provided instructions on the developed hardware. In October 1944, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. He survived the war.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n*{{cite book\n | last = \u6c5f\u9593 | first = \u4fdd\n | year = 1991\n | title = \u6025\u964d\u4e0b\u7206\u6483\u968a\u2015\u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u8ecd\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30c0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc (in Japanese)\n | publisher = \u4eca\u65e5\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u793e\n | isbn = 4875651384\n}}\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8}}\n* {{cite interview\n|interviewer=Joel Shepherd and Kan Sugahara\n|title=Accounts - Keiichi Arima\n|url=http://www.cv6.org/company/accounts/arima/}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arima, Keiichi}}\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= Keiichi Arima\n|birth_date=\n|death_date=\n|birth_place=\n|death_place=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Lieutenant Commander]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Arima}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Keiichi Arima'''|\u6709\u99ac \u656c\u4e00|Arima Keiichi|}} was a non-aviator [[dive bomber]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].
