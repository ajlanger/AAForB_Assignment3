The talipot palm, ''[[Corypha umbraculifera]]'', has a larger inflorescence, but it is branched rather than unbranched. ''A. titanum'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Sumatra]].\n\nDue to its odor, like that of a rotting corpse, the titan arum is characterized as a [[carrion flower]], and is also known as the '''corpse flower''' or '''corpse plant''' ({{lang-id|bunga bangkai}}\u2014''bunga'' means flower, while ''bangkai'' can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion). For the same reason, the title \"corpse flower\" is also attributed to the genus ''[[Rafflesia]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' derives its name from [[Ancient Greek]] ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|amorphos}}, \"without form, misshapen\" + {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|phallos}}, \"[[phallus]]\", and ''[[Titan (mythology)|titan]]'', \"giant\").\nThe popular name \"titan arum\" was coined by W.H. Hodge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ahsgardening.org/uploads/pdfs/1962-01r.pdf|title=A Titan Arum Flowers|last=Hodge|first=W.H.|date=1962|website=ahsgardening.org|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische mannen poseren bij twee verschillende soorten Amorphophallus planten waaronder een in bloei staande Amorphophallus Titanum TMnr 60042790.jpg|thumb|left|Two titan arum in Sumatra, Indonesia (ca. 1900\u201340); one in leaf, which can reach up to {{Convert|6|m}} tall, and one in bloom]]\n\nThe titan arum's [[inflorescence]] can reach over {{convert|3|m|4=0}} in height. Like the related [[arum maculatum|cuckoo pint]] and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lily]], it consists of a fragrant [[spadix (botany)|spadix]] of flowers wrapped by a [[spathe]], which looks like a large petal. In the case of the titan arum, the spathe is a deep green on the outside and dark burgundy red on the inside, with a deeply furrowed texture. The spadix is hollow and resembles a large [[baguette]]. Near the bottom of the spadix, hidden from view inside the sheath of the spathe, the spadix bears two rings of small flowers. The upper ring bears the male flowers, the lower ring is spangled with bright red-orange [[carpel]]s. The \"fragrance\" of the titan arum resembles rotting meat, attracting [[carrion]]-eating [[beetle]]s and flesh flies (family [[Sarcophagidae]]) that [[pollination|pollinate]] it. The inflorescence's deep red color and texture contribute to the illusion that the spathe is a piece of meat. During bloom, the tip of the spadix is approximately human body temperature, which helps the perfume volatilize; this heat is also believed to assist in the illusion that attracts carcass-eating insects.\n\nBoth male and female flowers grow in the same [[inflorescence]]. The female flowers open first, then a day or two following, the male flowers open. This usually prevents the flower from [[self-pollination|self-pollinating]].\n\nAfter the flower dies back, a single leaf, which reaches the size of a small tree, grows from the underground [[corm]]. The leaf grows on a somewhat green stalk that branches into three sections at the top, each containing many leaflets. The leaf structure can reach up to {{convert|6|m}} tall and {{convert|5|m}} across. Each year, the old leaf dies and a new one grows in its place. When the corm has stored enough energy, it becomes dormant for about four months. Then the process repeats.\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Corm 0136a.jpg|thumb|Small corm of ''A. titanum'', [[Muttart Conservatory]], Edmonton, Canada]]\nThe corm is the largest known, typically weighing around {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"UNCC\">{{cite web|url=https://gardens.uncc.edu/plant-and-gardening-information/titan-arum/|title=Titan Arum Blooming|year=2007|website= Events|publisher=UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> When a specimen at the Princess of Wales Conservatory, [[Kew Gardens]], was repotted after its dormant period, the weight was recorded as {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Kew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |title=About titan arum Amorphophallus titanum |year=2006 |website=Information sheetO10 |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142257/http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-15 }}</ref> In 2006, a corm in the Botanical Garden of Bonn, Germany was recorded at {{convert|117|kg|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"botgabn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/titan/titanevents.php|title=Titanenwurz \u2014 Bonner Bl\u00fctenst\u00e4nde|year=2013|accessdate=2013-06-23}}</ref> and an ''A. titanum'' grown in Gilford, New Hampshire by Dr. Louis Ricciardiello in 2010 weighed {{convert|305|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gilford Steamer (newspaper) July 1, 2010 pp. A1 & A9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/tallest-bloom/|title=Tallest bloom|publisher=}}</ref> However, the current record is held by a corm grown at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, weighing {{convert|153.9|kg|abbr=on}} after 7 years' growth from an initial corm the size of an orange.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/titan-arum/the-story-of-our-corm|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh \u2013 The story of our corm|last=McDonald|first=Charlotte|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2017-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' is native solely to western [[Sumatra]], and western [[Java]] where it grows in openings in rainforests on limestone hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |title=Amorphophallus titanum |author=University of Connecticut |date=14 Feb 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502024600/http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |archive-date=2012-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the plant is cultivated by [[botanical garden]]s and private collectors around the world.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe titan arum grows in the wild only in the [[equator]]ial [[rainforest]]s of [[Sumatra]], Indonesia. It was first scientifically described in 1878 by Italian [[botanist]] [[Odoardo Beccari]]. The plant flowers only infrequently in the wild and even more rarely when cultivated. It first flowered in cultivation at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], London, UK in 1889, with over one hundred cultivated blossoms since then. The first documented flowerings in the United States were at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1937 and 1939. This flowering also inspired the designation of the titan arum as the official flower of the [[Bronx]] in 1939, only to be replaced in 2000 by the [[day lily]]. The number of cultivated plants has increased in recent years, and it is not uncommon for there to be five or more flowering events in gardens around the world in a single year. Advanced pollination techniques mean that this plant is rarely cultivated by amateur gardeners. However In 2011, [[Roseville High School (Roseville, California)]] became the first high school in the world to successfully bring a titan arum to bloom.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rjuhsd.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=200&ModuleInstanceID=2483&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=14723&PageID=412 | title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/species/201811/fin-whale-mountain-gorilla-recovering-thanks-conservation-action-iucn-red-list|title=Fin Whale, Mountain Gorilla recovering thanks to conservation action \u2013 IUCN Red List|date=2018-11-14|website=IUCN|language=en|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Titanum Inside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The pollen area as seen from the inside (UC Davis, California)]]\n\nIn 2003, the tallest bloom in cultivation, some {{convert|2.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, was achieved at the Botanical Garden of the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany.

After its initial blooming, there can be considerable variation in blooming frequency.

Although most spathes begin to wilt within twelve hours, some have been known to remain open for 24 to 48 hours. As the spathe wilts, the female flowers lose receptivity to pollination.\n\nSelf-pollination is normally considered impossible, but in 1999, Huntington Botanical Garden botanists hand-pollinated their plant with its own pollen from ground-up male flowers. The procedure was successful, resulting in fruit and ten fertile seeds from which several seedlings eventually were produced.<ref>Huntington Botanical Gardens, California [http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 Self-pollination] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810221200/http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 |date=August 10, 2013 }}.

The talipot palm, ''[[Corypha umbraculifera]]'', has a larger inflorescence, but it is branched rather than unbranched. ''A. titanum'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Sumatra]].\n\nDue to its odor, like that of a rotting corpse, the titan arum is characterized as a [[carrion flower]], and is also known as the '''corpse flower''' or '''corpse plant''' ({{lang-id|bunga bangkai}}\u2014''bunga'' means flower, while ''bangkai'' can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion). For the same reason, the title \"corpse flower\" is also attributed to the genus ''[[Rafflesia]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' derives its name from [[Ancient Greek]] ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|amorphos}}, \"without form, misshapen\" + {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|phallos}}, \"[[phallus]]\", and ''[[Titan (mythology)|titan]]'', \"giant\").\nThe popular name \"titan arum\" was coined by W.H. Hodge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ahsgardening.org/uploads/pdfs/1962-01r.pdf|title=A Titan Arum Flowers|last=Hodge|first=W.H.|date=1962|website=ahsgardening.org|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische mannen poseren bij twee verschillende soorten Amorphophallus planten waaronder een in bloei staande Amorphophallus Titanum TMnr 60042790.jpg|thumb|left|Two titan arum in Sumatra, Indonesia (ca. 1900\u201340); one in leaf, which can reach up to {{Convert|6|m}} tall, and one in bloom]]\n\nThe titan arum's [[inflorescence]] can reach over {{convert|3|m|4=0}} in height. Like the related [[arum maculatum|cuckoo pint]] and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lily]], it consists of a fragrant [[spadix (botany)|spadix]] of flowers wrapped by a [[spathe]], which looks like a large petal. In the case of the titan arum, the spathe is a deep green on the outside and dark burgundy red on the inside, with a deeply furrowed texture. The spadix is hollow and resembles a large [[baguette]]. Near the bottom of the spadix, hidden from view inside the sheath of the spathe, the spadix bears two rings of small flowers. The upper ring bears the male flowers, the lower ring is spangled with bright red-orange [[carpel]]s. The \"fragrance\" of the titan arum resembles rotting meat, attracting [[carrion]]-eating [[beetle]]s and flesh flies (family [[Sarcophagidae]]) that [[pollination|pollinate]] it. The inflorescence's deep red color and texture contribute to the illusion that the spathe is a piece of meat. During bloom, the tip of the spadix is approximately human body temperature, which helps the perfume volatilize; this heat is also believed to assist in the illusion that attracts carcass-eating insects.\n\nBoth male and female flowers grow in the same [[inflorescence]]. The female flowers open first, then a day or two following, the male flowers open. This usually prevents the flower from [[self-pollination|self-pollinating]].\n\nAfter the flower dies back, a single leaf, which reaches the size of a small tree, grows from the underground [[corm]]. The leaf grows on a somewhat green stalk that branches into three sections at the top, each containing many leaflets. The leaf structure can reach up to {{convert|6|m}} tall and {{convert|5|m}} across. Each year, the old leaf dies and a new one grows in its place. When the corm has stored enough energy, it becomes dormant for about four months. Then the process repeats.\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Corm 0136a.jpg|thumb|Small corm of ''A. titanum'', [[Muttart Conservatory]], Edmonton, Canada]]\nThe corm is the largest known, typically weighing around {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"UNCC\">{{cite web|url=https://gardens.uncc.edu/plant-and-gardening-information/titan-arum/|title=Titan Arum Blooming|year=2007|website= Events|publisher=UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> When a specimen at the Princess of Wales Conservatory, [[Kew Gardens]], was repotted after its dormant period, the weight was recorded as {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Kew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |title=About titan arum Amorphophallus titanum |year=2006 |website=Information sheetO10 |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142257/http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-15 }}</ref> In 2006, a corm in the Botanical Garden of Bonn, Germany was recorded at {{convert|117|kg|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"botgabn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/titan/titanevents.php|title=Titanenwurz \u2014 Bonner Bl\u00fctenst\u00e4nde|year=2013|accessdate=2013-06-23}}</ref> and an ''A. titanum'' grown in Gilford, New Hampshire by Dr. Louis Ricciardiello in 2010 weighed {{convert|305|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gilford Steamer (newspaper) July 1, 2010 pp. A1 & A9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/tallest-bloom/|title=Tallest bloom|publisher=}}</ref> However, the current record is held by a corm grown at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, weighing {{convert|153.9|kg|abbr=on}} after 7 years' growth from an initial corm the size of an orange.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/titan-arum/the-story-of-our-corm|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh \u2013 The story of our corm|last=McDonald|first=Charlotte|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2017-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' is native solely to western [[Sumatra]], and western [[Java]] where it grows in openings in rainforests on limestone hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |title=Amorphophallus titanum |author=University of Connecticut |date=14 Feb 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502024600/http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |archive-date=2012-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the plant is cultivated by [[botanical garden]]s and private collectors around the world.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe titan arum grows in the wild only in the [[equator]]ial [[rainforest]]s of [[Sumatra]], Indonesia. It was first scientifically described in 1878 by Italian [[botanist]] [[Odoardo Beccari]]. The plant flowers only infrequently in the wild and even more rarely when cultivated. It first flowered in cultivation at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], London, UK in 1889, with over one hundred cultivated blossoms since then. The first documented flowerings in the United States were at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1937 and 1939. This flowering also inspired the designation of the titan arum as the official flower of the [[Bronx]] in 1939, only to be replaced in 2000 by the [[day lily]]. The number of cultivated plants has increased in recent years, and it is not uncommon for there to be five or more flowering events in gardens around the world in a single year. Advanced pollination techniques mean that this plant is rarely cultivated by amateur gardeners. However In 2011, [[Roseville High School (Roseville, California)]] became the first high school in the world to successfully bring a titan arum to bloom.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rjuhsd.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=200&ModuleInstanceID=2483&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=14723&PageID=412 | title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/species/201811/fin-whale-mountain-gorilla-recovering-thanks-conservation-action-iucn-red-list|title=Fin Whale, Mountain Gorilla recovering thanks to conservation action \u2013 IUCN Red List|date=2018-11-14|website=IUCN|language=en|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Titanum Inside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The pollen area as seen from the inside (UC Davis, California)]]\n\nIn 2003, the tallest bloom in cultivation, some {{convert|2.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, was achieved at the Botanical Garden of the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany.

After its initial blooming, there can be considerable variation in blooming frequency. Some plants may not bloom again for another 7 to 10 years while others may bloom every two to three years.<ref>Eastern Illinois University's [http://www.eiu.edu/grnhouse/titan_arum.php Three Titan Arum Blooms] 2012 Retrieved 2013-08-11</ref> There have also been documented cases of back-to-back blooms occurring within a year<ref>'Big Bucky' 5/2009 and 6/2009, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison</ref> and corms simultaneously sending up both a leaf (or two) and an inflorescence.<ref>'Big Bucky' 5/2012 and 'Little Stinker' 9/2009, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison</ref> There has also been an occasion when a corm produced multiple simultaneous blooms.<ref>University of Bonn Botanic Garden, Bonn, Germany [http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/docs/sibbaldia5.pdf Three blooms from one corm] Retrieved 2013-08-11</ref>\n\nThe [[spathe]] generally begins to open between mid-afternoon<ref>Eastern Illinois University's [http://www.eiu.edu/grnhouse/titan_arum.php Three Titan Arum blooms] 2012.

Although most spathes begin to wilt within twelve hours, some have been known to remain open for 24 to 48 hours. As the spathe wilts, the female flowers lose receptivity to pollination.\n\nSelf-pollination is normally considered impossible, but in 1999, Huntington Botanical Garden botanists hand-pollinated their plant with its own pollen from ground-up male flowers. The procedure was successful, resulting in fruit and ten fertile seeds from which several seedlings eventually were produced.<ref>Huntington Botanical Gardens, California [http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 Self-pollination] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810221200/http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 |date=August 10, 2013 }}.
