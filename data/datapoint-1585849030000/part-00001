Jock Ewing founded [[Ewing family (television)#Ewing Oil|Ewing Oil]] in 1930 and was the patriarch of the [[Ewing family (television)|Ewing family]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early life and career===\nJohn Ross \"Jock\" Ewing Sr. was born in 1909, the younger of two sons born to Leander Ewing and his wife. Through his older brother Jason, Jock got a job in an oil field in [[east Texas]]. While riding in a train [[boxcar]] he met [[Willard \"Digger\" Barnes]], and the two became friends. Jock, Digger, and Jason all became [[wildcatter]]s and began drilling their own fields. Digger had a unique ability to smell oil underground, and with Jock's business skills they began making a fortune.\n\nJason and Digger didn't get on much, while Jock stood up for Digger in those days. Jason eventually left [[Texas]] to wildcat in [[Alaska]], marrying a woman named Nancy Shaw, with whom he had a son Jack (played by [[Dack Rambo]]) and a daughter Jamie (played by [[Jenilee Harrison]]). Jock and Digger returned to Texas, where Jock met Digger's girlfriend, [[Miss Ellie Ewing|Ellie Southworth]]. In the long run, Digger's drinking and undependability made Miss Ellie see that Digger would never change, and that Digger was not the type of man to marry, and she left Digger for Jock. Digger started to wander across the country after Ellie left him, but Jock and Digger continued with their oil business ventures for a few more years. Even as late as 1939, Jock and Digger both signed a deal to share the profits of Ewing 23 between themselves and their heirs in perpetuity. However, when Ewing 6 came in, Jock put the field in his name only, to prevent Digger from gambling and drinking his half away. Digger was furious and he claimed that Jock had stolen the wells for himself, ending their friendship and business relationship.\n\n===Marriages and children===\nEllie Southworth was desperate to save Southfork, which was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but Jock was reluctant to marry, even after Miss Ellie chose him over Digger, because unbeknownst to Miss Ellie, Jock was previously married to a woman named Amanda Lewis and looked after her psychiatric needs. Amanda had suffered a mental breakdown shortly after she and Jock were married, and Jock put her in a mental hospital. The doctor told Jock that Amanda would never recover and advised Jock to divorce her, which he eventually did in 1930. In 1936, Jock and Miss Ellie married on the day that her family was to lose Southfork, and it was well known that Jock was the only man in Dallas with the money to save the ranch. Jock had a fragile and stormy relationship with Miss Ellie's father, Aaron Southworth, and with her brother Garrison; however, Barbara Southworth seemed to accept her new son-in-law, if only for Miss Ellie's sake. On his deathbed, Aaron accepted Jock as part of his family by giving him his favorite gun.\n\nJock and Miss Ellie had three sons together, [[J. R. Ewing|J.R.]], [[Gary Ewing|Gary]] and [[Bobby Ewing|Bobby]]. Jock served in [[World War II]], where he and an old army buddy, Tom Mallory, were shot down in a mission in [[Holland]]. They later returned to save the families who sheltered them. During his term in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Jock had an affair with an Army nurse from [[Emporia, Kansas]], named Margaret Hunter. Jock was shipped off to [[France]], and Margaret returned to the [[United States]]. She married her fianc\u00e9, Amos Krebbs, and soon thereafter gave birth to Jock's illegitimate son, [[Ray Krebbs]].\n\nAfter the war, Jock returned to Southfork and confessed to Miss Ellie about his affair with Margaret Hunter. She forgave him and they moved on. In 1948, Amos Krebbs left Margaret Hunter, leaving her to raise Ray as a single parent. In 1960, a 15-year-old Ray Krebbs showed up at Southfork with a note from his mother asking Jock to help Ray. Jock made Ray a hand on Southfork. Neither Jock, Miss Ellie nor Ray knew that Jock was Ray's father until 20 years later, when Amos Krebbs came to Dallas and revealed that Jock was Ray's father, bringing proof to back up his claim. Jock then welcomed Ray into the Ewing family, and personally explained it all to his family.\n\nAs the years passed from the 1930s onwards, Jock built Ewing Oil into one of the most powerful independent oil companies in Texas, much to the bitterness and jealousy of his former friend and business partner, Digger Barnes. Jock also became a successful rancher. Jock \"took over raising\" his eldest son J.R., showing him \"tough love\" and made him one of the most cunning and ruthless oil barons in the oil business. Jock came to heavily rely on J.R. in the management of Ewing Oil giving J.R. \"the fever for big business\" but \"never taught him when to stop\". Jock, for the most part, ignored his second son Gary, whom Jock considered weak and lacking the Ewing character, as Gary ran away from responsibility, began drinking excessively to handle the pressures of being a teenage husband and father, and couldn't stand up to J.R.'s bullying. Jock generally spoiled his youngest son, Bobby, who Jock considered to be \"the best of the lot\". Bobby had the morals that J.R. lacked and embraced Jock's favoritism. However, Bobby was often emotional, short-tempered and lacked the intelligence, drive, and focus to succeed in the oil business preferring football, women, ranching, and enjoying the social benefits of being a Ewing, which was earned by the hard work of Jock and J.R.\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1977, Jock retired as president of Ewing Oil. He made J.R. his successor and took a more active role in running Southfork with foreman Ray Krebbs.\n\n===Death===\nJock and Ellie briefly separated in 1981 after Miss Ellie learned that Jock was the power behind Takapa, a land development deal that she was fighting against on the grounds of conservationism.  After Ellie refused his order to back down and stay out of the matter, he left Southfork.  However, they quickly reconciled and went on a second honeymoon to [[Paris]]. Upon returning to the United States, Jock and Miss Ellie arrived in Washington. D.C., where they were met by the U.S. State Department with a request for Jock to lead the development of the oil industry in South America. Ellie returned to Southfork alone, while Jock had conferences in Washington. Jock briefly returned to Dallas for a few hours before leaving for South America. While flying back from [[Venezuela]] to [[Texas]], the helicopter he was in collided with a small plane and crashed into a lake. Jock's body was never found, but he was [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] in the fall of 1982. The storyline involving Jock's death was necessitated by the death of actor Jim Davis. A tribute to Davis was shown at the end of the episode \"The Search\"; a picture of Davis and the words \"Jim Davis 1909-1981\" was displayed for some moments as the final seconds of musical score played out before the final commercial break. A memorial headstone to Jock stands on Southfork Ranch, beside Miss Ellie's headstone and grave.\n\n==Wes Parmalee storyline==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\nIn a storyline during the 1986\u201387 season of the show, a man named Wes Parmalee (portrayed by [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]) came to Dallas, where Clayton and Ray hired him as ranch foreman on Southfork. One day, Miss Ellie found Jock's belt buckle, knife, letters, and photo of a young Miss Ellie in Parmalee's room. Wes then claimed to be Jock Ewing, and that he had survived the helicopter accident, which necessitated plastic surgery and rehab in a South American hospital. After passing a series of tests set by J.R. and Bobby, including [[X-ray]] tests, a [[polygraph]] test and knowledge about the Ewing family, including Jock's first wife Amanda and Ray being Jock's son, Wes convinced many in Dallas, in addition to Miss Ellie, Ray, and several other members of the Ewing family, that he could be Jock. However, Clayton, Bobby and J.R. utterly refused to believe any suggestion that Wes was Jock.\n\nBobby flew down and talked with the doctor who had treated Jock for a severe fever while he was in South America. Bobby returned to Southfork and revealed this information at a Ewing barbecue, where Jock's best friend Punk Anderson said that while he had the fever, Jock was telling the history of the Ewing family. This small piece of evidence against Wes Parmalee being Jock Ewing was seized upon. By then, Ray had told Wes that his presence was causing a lot of trouble to the family, just before Wes went to see Miss Ellie. Miss Ellie told her family that Wes had told her that he wasn't Jock.  However the scene where this supposedly happened was never filmed & occurred off screen. Additionally with hindsight the fact that his X-ray tests showed he had identical bone breakage scarring identical to Jock's X-rays would seem to support his claim that he was actually Jock. The Producer's left Wes's departure deliberately ambiguous \n\nThe storyline was an experiment to gauge an attempt to restore the late Jim Davis' character to the show, after efforts to recast proved futile after no suitable actor could initially be found to replace Davis. The intentions by the Producers was for Wes to actually be revealed as Jock.  Ultimately, viewer reaction was mixed, but not favorable, as Miss Ellie had found happiness with her remarriage to Clayton Farlow, and that actor Steve Forrest, then at 61, was 16 years younger than his predecessor.  Producers finally yielded to viewers and reneged on the original outcome of the storyline, leaving Jock supposedly dead for good by the end of the tenth season.  Since the tenth season was broadcast & with the ambiguous ending to Wes's departure, some fans have speculated that Wes may have been Jock but left to spare the family any more pain.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Ewingcar.jpg|right|thumb|Jock Ewing's Lincoln Mark V in a Southfork gift shop]]\nAfter Jim Davis' death, artist Ro Kim painted a portrait of the actor in his role as Jock Ewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosgallery.com/clients|title=Ro's Gallery: Clients - Celebrities|accessdate=July 15, 2006}}</ref> The portrait became a focal point of the ''Dallas'' set and was featured in a number of episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077000/trivia|title=Trivia for \"Dallas\"|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|accessdate=July 15, 2007|quote=After Jim Davis died, a portrait of him hung above the fireplace at Southfork as a memorial to the actor.
