The first \"season\" of the game had players looking for \"The Receda Cube\" (referred to simply as \"The Cube\"), a priceless scientific and spiritual artifact to the people of a fictional [[metropolis]] known as \"Perplex City\", that had been stolen and buried somewhere on Earth. The game offered a real-life [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]100,000 reward (approx. [[United States dollar|$]]130,000 or [[Euro|\u20ac]]115,000) to whoever found it. Like most alternate reality games, the story of Perplex City is told through blogs, puzzles, and other various media.\n\nThe game began in April 2005, and was won by Andy Darley of [[Middlesex]], [[UK]], who found The Cube in a wooded area in Northamptonshire, UK on 2 February 2007.<ref name=\"BBC\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6344375.stm Digital Treasure Hunt gets Winner], a [[BBC]] story.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mind Candy, the first wave of cards for the new game season, called [[Perplex City Stories]], would be released on March 1, 2007. However, in June 2007, they released an announcement which declared that the second season was on indefinite hold.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Perplex City ===\n\nPerplex City is a massive fictitious metropolis that has an unknown number of connections to Earth. It has a near-future feel to it, with advanced mobile technology, neuro-enhancing pharmaceuticals and kilometer-high skyscrapers. There is also a slightly more Utopian element to city life than we commonly find on Earth. The most important characteristic of the city's culture is the importance they place on puzzles and other mental pursuits. Their leading competitive event, the Academy Games, is primarily a competition of intellectual skill rather than physical strength. In fact, nearly every part of their culture touches upon the cryptic and mind.\n\nTheir religions fall loosely around a mythology of building, construction and technology, none of which are explicitly theistic. The Cube is, in all cases, a sacred and holy object, and rightfully so. It possesses a range of unusual properties which many believe to be of a supernatural origin.\n\n=== Citizens of Perplex City ===\nKey figures in city life include Sente Kiteway, Master of The Academy (The academy being an advanced learning institution in the city) and former custodian of the Cube. His two daughters, Scarlett and Violet, communicate regularly with the people of Earth through their blogs. Pietro Salk, an investigative reporter for leading newspaper ''The Sentinel'', produced many leads before he was unceremoniously killed off for getting too close to the truth. The team at the Academy tasked with returning the Cube (and ostensibly authors of the puzzle cards) are also frequently in touch, and Kurt McAllister is an important ally to players on Earth.\n\n== Plot ==\nAn artifact called the Receda Cube (pronounced /''Reh-'''kay'''-duh''/) is stolen from the Perplex City Academy and makes its way to Earth. A Cube Retrieval Team (CRT) is formed to search for the Cube. Because citizens of Perplex City are unable to travel to Earth, the Master of Perplex City Academy, Sente Kiteway, asks for help in finding the Cube from the citizens of Earth, offering to share any leads or clues that he or the CRT may get.\n\nClues to the location of the Cube are periodically left by the person who stole it, known only as Combed Thunderclap. It is discovered that an organization called the Third Power and a Cube-worshipping cult called the Reconstructionists are also looking for the Cube. While the people of Earth are left to search for the Cube on Earth, various citizens of Perplex City, particularly Kurt McAllister and Sente\u2019s two daughters, Scarlett and Violet, attempt to find additional clues in Perplex City and to discover the identity of Combed Thunderclap. The former three discover the lab in which the Cube was made. They find that the Cube was built by Sente and can be used as a weapon and a teleporter. The Cube is finally found by the people of Earth in [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]];<ref name=\"AndyDarley1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.andthenhesaid.com/cube/story4.html|title=The Perplex City endgame story: The weekend|website=www.andthenhesaid.com}}</ref><ref name=\"AndyDarley2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.andthenhesaid.com/cube/story5.html|title=The Perplex City endgame story: The end|website=www.andthenhesaid.com}}</ref> they also determine that it was Violet who stole the Cube and hid it on Earth,<ref>[http://www.quirkyacuity.com Violet Underground] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216082324/http://www.quirkyacuity.com/ |date=2007-02-16 }}</ref> in an effort to keep it out of the hands of the Third Power.\n\n==Puzzle cards==\n<!-- NOTE: This section is linked to from [[Perplex City Stories]] -->\nMind Candy sells a series of collectible puzzle cards. They are sold in booster packs, with each pack containing six random cards from the total possible 256 cards. Cards are divided into sets and subsets of varying rarity and difficulty.\n\nUnlike CCGs such as [[Magic: The Gathering]] or [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game|Pok\u00e9mon]], though, the cards are not designed for competitive player-versus-player \"combat\". Instead, each card depicts a different puzzle, with the rarer cards also featuring more complex riddles. Cards are marked with unique identifiers which can then be entered onto the Perplex City website, earning points and a place on a [[Game ladder|leaderboard]]. Many cards contain hidden features, such as ultraviolet or [[heat-sensitive ink]]s, and they cover a broad range of themes from pop-culture trivia to [[cryptography]] and logic brainteasers.\n\nEach card is a member of a four-card set. If all four cards are solved by a player, they receive double points for each card in the set.\n\n=== Unsolved cards ===\nAs of February 2020, two cards from the first season are yet to be solved:\n* Riemann (S1, Card #238) apparently asks players to prove the [[Riemann hypothesis]].\n* Billion to One (S1, Card #256) features the face of a man, with a caption in Japanese that reads \u79c1\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u306a\u3055\u3044, which translates to \"Find Me.\" His image has been spread to social networking sites, in attempts to locate and make contact with this person.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://findsatoshi.wordpress.com/|title=Find Satoshi|website=Find Satoshi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902044948/http://www.billion2one.org/|title=billion2one.org: Help Us Find This Man!|date=September 2, 2006|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Out of print cards ===\nTwo cards are no longer in circulation. The cards were excluded from wave-three print runs because they did not fit on the print layout. While these problems have been rectified, Mind Candy has no plans to replace or reprint these cards in the future. They are:\n*Card #238 (Riemann) - chosen to be excluded due to the complete inability of the card to be solved for the foreseeable future.\n*Card #245 (Relativity) - chosen to be excluded more or less at random, but the decision was no doubt influenced by the fact that the problem and solution are quite complex.\n\n== ARG features ==\nThe puzzle cards are intended as an introduction to the characters and story of Perplex City itself, and the deeper mysteries of the Cube theft. Clues found on the cards direct players to various [[websites]], [[blogs]], [[emails]], [[Telephone|phone calls]], and [[Short message service|SMS messages]], originating from Perplex City. These often feature puzzles of their own, whose solutions lead to further puzzles.  Frequently these puzzles require players to co-operate in reaching various goals.\n\nPerplex City has been running since late 2004, much longer than the traditional ARG. Its longevity has allowed for a number of events that simply would not be possible within a two-month traditional lifespan of an ARG.
