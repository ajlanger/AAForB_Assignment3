His music crosses several genres. He has been described as \"one of the most revered guitarists of his generation\" who has \"drawn praise from fellow musicians including [[Marillion]]'s [[Steve Rothery]] and [[Deep Purple]]'s [[Ritchie Blackmore]].\"<ref name=\"M Magazine\">{{cite web | url= https://www.m-magazine.co.uk/features/interview-gordon-giltrap/ | title= Interview: Gordon Giltrap | website=M Magazine| date=10 January 2019 |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGiltrap was born on 6 April 1948 in the village of [[Brenchley]] in [[Kent]]. He started to play the guitar at the age of 12 and received no formal tuition, choosing to develop his own style and technique.\n\n==Career==\nGiltrap's career took off in the 1960s while performing in the [[folk music]] scene in London alongside contemporaries such as [[Bert Jansch]], [[John Renbourn]], and [[Mike Oldfield]]. At 18, Giltrap signed with [[Transatlantic Records]] and released his debut studio albums, ''Gordon Giltrap'' (1968) and ''Portrait'' (1969). Both feature himself on guitar and lead vocals; Giltrap considered his lyrics as \"naive\".<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 31</ref> The track \"Willow Pattern\" from his debut attracted the praise of guitarist [[Ralph McTell]] for the imagery it portrayed.<ref name=\":0\">''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 39</ref> \"Gospel Song\", also from his first, features a more aggressive strumming style,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.giltrap.co.uk/news/general/archives/General_News/2917|title=Gordon Giltrap|website=Giltrap.co.uk}}</ref> influenced by [[Pete Townshend]], which later became a trademark of his style. In 1969, Giltrap was featured in Transatlantic's guitar showcase album ''The Contemporary Guitar Sampler, Volume 1''.<ref>The Contemporary Guitar Sampler Vol 1, Transatlantic Records \u2013 TRA SAM 14, 1969</ref> He was also featured on the second volume released in 1970,<ref name=\":1\">The Contemporary Guitar Sampler Volume 2, Transatlantic Records \u2013 TRA SAM 15, 1970</ref> and both increased his profile.\n\nShortly after the release of his first album, Giltrap joined the Buskers' Tour of the UK, headlined by [[Don Partridge]]. Giltrap subsequently formed a band with Partridge called Accolade. Together they released a self-titled album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=4229|title=progarchives|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> While Partridge, had found fame with the hit single 'Rosie' in 1968. Partridge later wrote the sleeve notes for ''Portrait''. Giltrap played lead guitar in the band and penned several compositions. Whilst his involvement in the band certainly helped to raise his profile he felt impatient to move on to recording further new albums under his own name.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.37</ref>\n\nIn 1970 Giltrap signed to [[MCA Records|MCA records]] and released his next album ''Testament of Time'' which was again a mixture of songs and instrumental pieces. The latter included a skillfully-played piece entitled 'Catwalk Blues' which was to resurface, reworked, (and, in Giltrap\u2019s opinion, improved).<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018 First edition, Steve Pilkington, p. 39</ref> on two future albums. It was to be one of the pieces he chose to play on his first television appearance on [[Disco 2 (TV series)|Disco 2]] the forerunner to BBC's [[The Old Grey Whistle Test]].\n\nAt this stage he was managed by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] who, amongst others, also managed [[Wishbone Ash]]. Strings on the album were arranged by [[Del Newman]] who also played keyboards. Newman had already worked with many well-known artists of that era including [[Cat Stevens]]. As he became better known and more greatly respected, Newman later went on to work with many famous artists including [[Elton John]] and [[George Harrison]].<ref>Perilous Journey 2018 First edition\n\nSteve Pilkington Page 38</ref> Thus began a lasting friendship and indeed it was Giltrap who wrote the foreword for Newman's 2010 autobiography ''A Touch From God (It's Only Rock and Roll)''.<ref>''A Touch From God - It's Only Rock and Roll'', {{ISBN|9781906358792}}</ref> With Newman's influence, the album had a much fuller sound than Giltrap\u2019s previous two albums and he regarded it as a significant step forward.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis association with [[Miles Copeland III|Copeland]] ended when he moved to [[Philips Records|Philips records]] releasing the 1973 album entitled ''Giltrap''. This album was interesting in that it featured a much larger band. On some of the songs he experimented with early instruments (played by Douglas Wooton and Rod and Joseph Sleeping) and some of his lyrics reflected clearly reflected an interest in historical events. The drummer on this album was [[Nicko McBrain|\u201dNicko\u201d McBrain]] who a decade later would join [[Iron Maiden]].\n\nThe front cover photographs reflect Giltrap as a proud father blowing bubbles together with his son, Jamie, who had been born two years previously. The opening track 'When I See My Son' further reflected that pride. Sadly never released on CD, this was the last album on which he sang lead vocals. The photo on the rear cover of the album showed Giltrap wearing a tank top in a Cat Stevens-like pose.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2017, Steve Pilkington, p. 46</ref> As he became less convinced by his lyric writing capabilities he began seeking a different path.\n\nWhile popular on the folk and university circuit, Giltrap reached a turning point and received greater recognition during the 1970s. During this time Giltrap started to concentrate on more purely instrumental pieces, and in 1976 released the album ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'', based on the art and poetry of [[William Blake]]. Work on the new album obviously required significant additional time in the recording studio. Once, whilst recording, he missed the birth of his daughter Sadie, who arrived to his great delight on 5th March 1975.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.56</ref>\n\n''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' was produced by Jon Miller who along with guitarist Roger Hand and keyboard player Rod Edwards<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodedwardsmusic.com/page2.php|title=Rod Edwards Music.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  were known as Triumvirate Productions.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 58</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/823876-Triumvirate-Production|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Hand and Edwards, having listened to demos of some of the material for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' decided that it was time for Giltrap to be dragged, initially reluctantly into the realm of rock music.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> With this new sound however, Giltrap found a different audience and gained greater commercial success.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.59</ref>  To this day he remains grateful to these two for their influence in helping with the new direction his music took at that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> The success of this album prompted Giltrap to move on from the [[singer-songwriter]] approach and to form the Gordon Giltrap Band<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1389762-Gordon-Giltrap-Band|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, which toured extensively in the UK at that time. \n\nOnce the demos for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' were finished Giltrap found himself with a three album record contract with [https://www.discogs.com/label/24104-The-Electric-Record-Company Electric Records].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref>&nbsp; Now more in the public eye, he was delighted when offered a UK tour supporting the English progressive rock band '[[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]'. This tour helped to raise his public profile significantly. Perhaps as a result of this he was invited to appear on BBC's '[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]' hosted by [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]]. Supported by his full band they performed ''Robes and Crowns/Awakening'''and ''Lucifer's Cage''. Footage of the latter performance still survives and can be seen on the program 'Guitar Heroes at the BBC'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lkrr7/episodes/guide|title=Guitar Heroes at the BBC|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA European tour followed at the end of 1976 as a support act to the well-known rock band, '[[Wishbone Ash]]'. They played several dates in [[Germany]] and were also booked to tour [[Switzerland]]. Unfortunately, upon arriving in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] Giltrap was hit by a car and broke his collarbone.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.66</ref> As he was then unable to play guitar the rest of his tour was sadly cancelled.\n\nHis follow-up album ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It peaked in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No. 29.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=1-904994-10-5|edition=19th|location=London|page=227}}</ref> A [[single (music)|single]] taken from the album, \"''Heartsong''\", received extensive airplay and reached No. 21 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /> The track was later used as the [[theme tune]] of the [[BBC TV]] series ''[[Holiday (TV series)|Holiday]]''. Another of Giltrap's tracks, \"The Carnival\", was specially commissioned by ITV for the theme tune to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s holiday programme ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]''.\n\n''Heartsong'' has subsequently become the tune for which Giltrap is best known and features in his live sets to this day. ''Heartsong'' was eventually nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for the best instrumental/ orchestral piece for that year. The recipient was [[Elton John]] for [[Song for Guy]]. Giltrap told the story of the track's creation to [[Teamrock.com|Teamrock]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/gordon-giltrap/heartsong|title=Songfacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n\u201cIt began with a song I did in the late '60s called '<nowiki/>''Starting All Over.''<nowiki/>'When I lived in London I began to mess around with it and stumbled on the riff for what would become '''Heartsong''.' I kept working on it, and eventually recorded the guitar part for it. Then we added the rhythm section from [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) and [[John G. Perry]] (bass).\"\n\n\"At the time I never thought of this as anything other than a jolly little tune, but my producers Rod Edwards and Roger Hand realized the commercial potential in what we had. The melody really came out when the [[Minimoog|mini moog]] part was added, and then Eddie Spence (keyboards) came up with the fast moving synth figure. Edwards and Hand recorded Eddie at half speed, then played it back at normal speed to get the desired effect. That was something they learnt from working with [[George Martin]].\"\n\nWhilst ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' had evolved from acoustic compositions adapted for a bigger band, ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' was composed with a bigger band sound in mind and thus it had greater cohesiveness than the previous album. It appeared occasionally to be more keyboard dominated but Giltrap was unperturbed by this as the pieces were his own compositions and he was really pleased with the arrangements which he had worked on with Rod Edwards and Roger Hand.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.71</ref> \n\nIn those days albums had to flow from artists at consistent rates and few acts dared to allow time for the public to forget them. Such was the case with Giltrap who released his next album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Gordon Giltrap album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', was released in 1978. [[Iron Maiden]], whose future drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] played on the 1973 album by Giltrap, used the same title for a later album, and the font in their logo is quite similar to the \"Gordon Giltrap\" logo on the ''Fear of the Dark'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.giltrap.co.uk/news/general/archives/General_News/2948|title=Gordon Giltrap|website=Giltrap.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt this stage, after the success of his previous two albums, Giltrap was riding on a high. Creativity was in full flow so material for his next release was relatively swiftly assembled. The resultant album was arguably one of his finest. The title track, in shortened form, was released as a single but disappointingly failed to achieve the success of ''Heartsong''.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.86</ref> It reached number 48 in the singles charts and the band appeared on [[Top of the Pops]].\n\nOne track on the album entitled ''Fast Approaching'' was a reworked track, vastly different from the original which had appeared on Giltrap's first album. It was extended to five minutes and featured Giltrap on both [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]]. He was now becoming far more familiar with the latter instrument and at this stage really enjoyed playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.89</ref> Giltrap's electric guitar playing is a feature on this album but he was always first and foremost an acoustic guitarist and before too long the electric guitar featured less and less in his work. \n\nThe drummer on this album was the highly talented [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] who had also played on the previous two Giltrap albums and who has since progressed to become one of the most highly commended and influential British drummers.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref> One of his first jobs as a professional drummer came when he joined Giltrap to record ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' in 1975/6 and he still speaks fondly of that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref>  He has since played session work with many well known acts including '[[The Who]]'. Indeed, [[Pete Townshend]] initially employed Phillips because he loved his work on Giltrap\u2019s albums.<ref>''Who I Am'' - Pete Townshend.  2012 edition Page 318</ref>  Phillips later became the drummer for the American rock band '[[Toto (band)|Toto]]' which he joined in 1992. \n\nBy this stage in Giltrap's career he was beginning to be concerned about becoming too predictable. He decided to move away from playing with a band and move back towards solo work. Giltrap's next album '[https://www.giltrap.co.uk/cds/f/CDs/512 The Peacock Party'] which was released in 1979, was inspired by a book of the same name. This was in part illustrated by [[Alan Aldridge]] who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album. A previous book entitled '[[The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast|The Butterfly Ball and The Grasshopper's Feast]]' had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars. The Triumvirate team had also been working on an album inspired by the book featuring the voices of [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Hordern]] and it also featured celebrated musicians including [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] and [[Bruce Lynch]] both of whom had previously worked extensively with [[Cat Stevens]]. Aldridge appeared to prefer Triumvirates's version and it was he who brought his next book '[https://www.stellabooks.com/books/alan-aldridge/the-peacock-party-504317/1309545 The Peacock Party]'\u00a0 to the Triumvirate team to see if they were interested in another project. Triumvirate felt this was a good project for Giltrap to pursue.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.107</ref>\n\nGiltrap\u2019s pieces on this album are less complicated but still feature a full band sound. The whole feel of the album is more upbeat than his previous three. The tracks are shorter in length and, ironically, feature Giltrap playing more electric guitar than previous albums.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Giltrap had decided at this stage to move away from more commercial music<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.105</ref>  and concentrate solely upon self-penned intricate guitar pieces. However, whilst working on\u00a0'The Peacock Party' he decided to retain the big band sound and incorporated many excellent musicians within his pieces with whom he felt very comfortable working. For example, the album featured the first of Giltrap's several collaborations with violinist [[Ric Sanders|Ric Sanders]] of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[John Etheridge]] of '[[Soft Machine]]' also features.\n\nThis album showcases a wide range of Giltrap's talents from his strident electric guitar work on the opening track, 'Headwind' to the intricacy of second acoustic track 'Magpie Rag'. This track incorporates a complex, oft-repeated riff around which the whole piece is based. As the album progresses each track features different ranges of instruments and highlights different skills. \n\nThe final track, '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUX6NBMIBE8 Dodo's Dream]' has become a much admired, iconic feature of his live performances in which he uses a [https://www.guitarworld.com/blogs/loop-introduction-looping looper] and overdubbing to skillfully build up the piece.\n\nWhen he finished recording he embarked on a small tour in his favoured trio format which featured Ric Sanders on violin and long-term ally [https://www.discogs.com/artist/1232997-Eddie-Spence Eddie Spence] on keyboards. This diversion concluded at a tricky time in his life when his first marriage broke up and his mother, with whom he was very close, passed away having contracted cancer aged just 58.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.111</ref> \n\nThe tour to promote the album was four-piece comprising Giltrap, [[Clive Bunker]] - drums, [https://www.discogs.com/artist/648905-Rod-Edwards Rod Edwards] - keyboards and [https://www.discogs.com/artist/417265-Bimbo-Acock 'Bimbo' Acock] on saxophone, flute and additional keyboards. The tour was a success and boosted Giltrap at a time when he was feeling really low. However, all good things come to an end and a new home required a fresh start. \n\nBy the end of the 1970s he had been commissioned to write a number of notable pieces, such as the classically inspired ''The Brotherhood'', based on the art of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s, and ''The Eye of the Wind Rhapsody'',<ref name=\"Eye\">[http://www.giltrap.co.uk/index.php?page=cds&display=20&category=03--Dual_Disc_DVD-slash-CD \"Gordon Giltrap and Friends at the Symphony Hall\"], Live Recording (2006), La Cooka Ratcha, Cat. No. LCVP160CD</ref> an orchestral work celebrating the exploration of the New World by British sailing ships. In the 1990s Giltrap played a key role in [[Cliff Richard]]'s ''[[Heathcliff (musical)|Heathcliff]]'' [[musical theatre|musical]], playing the musical [[narrator]]. He also composed a number of pieces for the show.\n\nIn late 2009, Giltrap started \"Three Parts Guitar\", a short tour with the classical guitarist Raymond Burley and the jazz guitarist [[John Etheridge]]. In 2011 this was expanded to \"Four Parts Guitar\" with the addition of guitarist, [[Clive Carroll]]. An album of the same name was released the same year.\n\nFor two years, around 1997,{{when|date=January 2011}} Giltrap wrote a regular acoustic column for ''Total Guitar'' magazine. An anthology of 26 of these articles is published in ''Total Giltrap'',<ref>Giltrap, Gordon (2002).

The latter included a skillfully-played piece entitled 'Catwalk Blues' which was to resurface, reworked, (and, in Giltrap\u2019s opinion, improved).<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018 First edition, Steve Pilkington, p. 39</ref> on two future albums. It was to be one of the pieces he chose to play on his first television appearance on [[Disco 2 (TV series)|Disco 2]] the forerunner to BBC's [[The Old Grey Whistle Test]].\n\nAt this stage he was managed by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] who, amongst others, also managed [[Wishbone Ash]]. Strings on the album were arranged by [[Del Newman]] who also played keyboards. Newman had already worked with many well-known artists of that era including [[Cat Stevens]]. As he became better known and more greatly respected, Newman later went on to work with many famous artists including [[Elton John]] and [[George Harrison]].<ref>Perilous Journey 2018 First edition\n\nSteve Pilkington Page 38</ref> Thus began a lasting friendship and indeed it was Giltrap who wrote the foreword for Newman's 2010 autobiography ''A Touch From God (It's Only Rock and Roll)''.<ref>''A Touch From God - It's Only Rock and Roll'', {{ISBN|9781906358792}}</ref> With Newman's influence, the album had a much fuller sound than Giltrap\u2019s previous two albums and he regarded it as a significant step forward.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis association with [[Miles Copeland III|Copeland]] ended when he moved to [[Philips Records|Philips records]] releasing the 1973 album entitled ''Giltrap''. This album was interesting in that it featured a much larger band. On some of the songs he experimented with early instruments (played by Douglas Wooton and Rod and Joseph Sleeping) and some of his lyrics reflected clearly reflected an interest in historical events. The drummer on this album was [[Nicko McBrain|\u201dNicko\u201d McBrain]] whom a decade later would join [[Iron Maiden]].\n\nThe front cover photographs reflect Giltrap as a proud father blowing bubbles together with his son, Jamie, who had been born two years previously. The opening track 'When I See My Son' further reflected that pride. Sadly never released on CD, this was the last album on which he sang lead vocals. The photo on the rear cover of the album showed Giltrap wearing a tank top in a Cat Stevens-like pose.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2017, Steve Pilkington, p. 46</ref> As he became less convinced by his lyric writing capabilities he began seeking a different path.\n\nWhile popular on the folk and university circuit, Giltrap reached a turning point and received greater recognition during the 1970s. During this time Giltrap started to concentrate on more purely instrumental pieces, and in 1976 released the album ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'', based on the art and poetry of [[William Blake]]. Work on the new album obviously required significant additional time in the recording studio. Once, whilst recording, he missed the birth of his daughter Sadie, who arrived to his great delight on 5th March 1975.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.56</ref>\n\n''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' was produced by Jon Miller who along with guitarist Roger Hand and keyboard player Rod Edwards<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodedwardsmusic.com/page2.php|title=Rod Edwards Music.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  were known as Triumvirate Productions.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 58</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/823876-Triumvirate-Production|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Hand and Edwards, having listened to demos of some of the material for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' decided that it was time for Giltrap to be dragged, initially reluctantly into the realm of rock music.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> With this new sound however, Giltrap found a different audience and gained greater commercial success.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.59</ref>  To this day he remains grateful to these two for their influence in helping with the new direction his music took at that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> The success of this album prompted Giltrap to move on from the [[singer-songwriter]] approach and to form the Gordon Giltrap Band<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1389762-Gordon-Giltrap-Band|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, which toured extensively in the UK at that time. \n\nOnce the demos for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' were finished Giltrap found himself with a three album record contract with [https://www.discogs.com/label/24104-The-Electric-Record-Company Electric Records].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref>&nbsp; Now more in the public eye, he was delighted when offered a UK tour supporting the English progressive rock band '[[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]'. This tour helped to raise his public profile significantly. Perhaps as a result of this he was invited to appear on BBC's '[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]' hosted by [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]]. Supported by his full band they performed ''Robes and Crowns/Awakening'''and ''Lucifer's Cage''. Footage of the latter performance still survives and can be seen on the program 'Guitar Heroes at the BBC'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lkrr7/episodes/guide|title=Guitar Heroes at the BBC|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA European tour followed at the end of 1976 as a support act to the well-known rock band, '[[Wishbone Ash]]'. They played several dates in [[Germany]] and were also booked to tour [[Switzerland]]. Unfortunately, upon arriving in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] Giltrap was hit by a car and broke his collarbone.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.66</ref> As he was then unable to play guitar the rest of his tour was sadly cancelled.\n\nHis follow-up album ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It peaked in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No. 29.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=1-904994-10-5|edition=19th|location=London|page=227}}</ref> A [[single (music)|single]] taken from the album, \"''Heartsong''\", received extensive airplay and reached No. 21 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /> The track was later used as the [[theme tune]] of the [[BBC TV]] series ''[[Holiday (TV series)|Holiday]]''. Another of Giltrap's tracks, \"The Carnival\", was specially commissioned by ITV for the theme tune to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s holiday programme ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]''.\n\n''Heartsong'' has subsequently become the tune for which Giltrap is best known and features in his live sets to this day. ''Heartsong'' was eventually nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for the best instrumental/ orchestral piece for that year. The recipient was [[Elton John]] for [[Song for Guy]]. Giltrap told the story of the track's creation to [[Teamrock.com|Teamrock]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/gordon-giltrap/heartsong|title=Songfacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n\u201cIt began with a song I did in the late '60s called '<nowiki/>''Starting All Over.''<nowiki/>'When I lived in London I began to mess around with it and stumbled on the riff for what would become '''Heartsong''.' I kept working on it, and eventually recorded the guitar part for it. Then we added the rhythm section from [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) and [[John G. Perry]] (bass).\"\n\n\"At the time I never thought of this as anything other than a jolly little tune, but my producers Rod Edwards and Roger Hand realized the commercial potential in what we had. The melody really came out when the [[Minimoog|mini moog]] part was added, and then Eddie Spence (keyboards) came up with the fast moving synth figure. Edwards and Hand recorded Eddie at half speed, then played it back at normal speed to get the desired effect. That was something they learnt from working with [[George Martin]].\"\n\nWhilst ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' had evolved from acoustic compositions adapted for a bigger band, ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' was composed with a bigger band sound in mind and thus it had greater cohesiveness than the previous album. It appeared occasionally to be more keyboard dominated but Giltrap was unperturbed by this as the pieces were his own compositions and he was really pleased with the arrangements which he had worked on with Rod Edwards and Roger Hand.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.71</ref> \n\nIn those days albums had to flow from artists at consistent rates and few acts dared to allow time for the public to forget them. Such was the case with Giltrap who released his next album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Gordon Giltrap album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', was released in 1978. [[Iron Maiden]], whose future drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] played on the 1973 album by Giltrap, used the same title for a later album, and the font in their logo is quite similar to the \"Gordon Giltrap\" logo on the ''Fear of the Dark'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.giltrap.co.uk/news/general/archives/General_News/2948|title=Gordon Giltrap|website=Giltrap.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt this stage, after the success of his previous two albums, Giltrap was riding on a high. Creativity was in full flow so material for his next release was relatively swiftly assembled. The resultant album was arguably one of his finest. The title track, in shortened form, was released as a single but disappointingly failed to achieve the success of ''Heartsong''.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.86</ref> It reached number 48 in the singles charts and the band appeared on [[Top of the Pops]].\n\nOne track on the album entitled ''Fast Approaching'' was a reworked track, vastly different from the original which had appeared on Giltrap's first album. It was extended to five minutes and featured Giltrap on both [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]]. He was now becoming far more familiar with the latter instrument and at this stage really enjoyed playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.89</ref> Giltrap's electric guitar playing is a feature on this album but he was always first and foremost an acoustic guitarist and before too long the electric guitar featured less and less in his work. \n\nThe drummer on this album was the highly talented [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] who had also played on the previous two Giltrap albums and who has since progressed to become one of the most highly commended and influential British drummers.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref> One of his first jobs as a professional drummer came when he joined Giltrap to record ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' in 1975/6 and he still speaks fondly of that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref>  He has since played session work with many well known acts including '[[The Who]]'. Indeed, [[Pete Townshend]] initially employed Phillips because he loved his work on Giltrap\u2019s albums.<ref>''Who I Am'' - Pete Townshend.  2012 edition Page 318</ref>  Phillips later became the drummer for the American rock band '[[Toto (band)|Toto]]' which he joined in 1992. \n\nBy this stage in Giltrap's career he was beginning to be concerned about becoming too predictable. He decided to move away from playing with a band and move back towards solo work. Giltrap's next album '[https://www.giltrap.co.uk/cds/f/CDs/512 The Peacock Party'] which was released in 1979, was inspired by a book of the same name. This was in part illustrated by [[Alan Aldridge]] who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album. A previous book entitled '[[The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast|The Butterfly Ball and The Grasshopper's Feast]]' had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars. The Triumvirate team had also been working on an album inspired by the book featuring the voices of [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Hordern]] and it also featured celebrated musicians including [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] and [[Bruce Lynch]] both of whom had previously worked extensively with [[Cat Stevens]]. Aldridge appeared to prefer Triumvirates's version and it was he who brought his next book '[https://www.stellabooks.com/books/alan-aldridge/the-peacock-party-504317/1309545 The Peacock Party]'\u00a0 to the Triumvirate team to see if they were interested in another project. Triumvirate felt this was a good project for Giltrap to pursue.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.107</ref>\n\nGiltrap\u2019s pieces on this album are less complicated but still feature a full band sound. The whole feel of the album is more upbeat than his previous three. The tracks are shorter in length and, ironically, feature Giltrap playing more electric guitar than previous albums.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Giltrap had decided at this stage to move away from more commercial music<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.105</ref>  and concentrate solely upon self-penned intricate guitar pieces. However, whilst working on\u00a0'The Peacock Party' he decided to retain the big band sound and incorporated many excellent musicians within his pieces with whom he felt very comfortable working. For example, the album featured the first of Giltrap's several collaborations with violinist [[Ric Sanders|Ric Sanders]] of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[John Etheridge]] of '[[Soft Machine]]' also features.\n\nThis album showcases a wide range of Giltrap's talents from his strident electric guitar work on the opening track, 'Headwind' to the intricacy of second acoustic track 'Magpie Rag'. This track incorporates a complex, oft-repeated riff around which the whole piece is based. As the album progresses each track features different ranges of instruments and highlights different skills. \n\nThe final track, '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUX6NBMIBE8 Dodo's Dream]' has become a much admired, iconic feature of his live performances in which he uses a [https://www.guitarworld.com/blogs/loop-introduction-looping looper] and overdubbing to skillfully build up the piece.\n\nWhen he finished recording he embarked on a small tour in his favoured trio format which featured Ric Sanders on violin and long-term ally [https://www.discogs.com/artist/1232997-Eddie-Spence Eddie Spence] on keyboards. This diversion concluded at a tricky time in his life when his first marriage broke up and his mother, with whom he was very close, passed away having contracted cancer aged just 58.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.111</ref> \n\nThe tour to promote the album was four-piece comprising Giltrap, [[Clive Bunker]] - drums, [https://www.discogs.com/artist/648905-Rod-Edwards Rod Edwards] - keyboards and [https://www.discogs.com/artist/417265-Bimbo-Acock 'Bimbo' Acock] on saxophone, flute and additional keyboards. The tour was a success and boosted Giltrap at a time when he was feeling really low. However, all good things come to an end and a new home required a fresh start. \n\nBy the end of the 1970s he had been commissioned to write a number of notable pieces, such as the classically inspired ''The Brotherhood'', based on the art of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s, and ''The Eye of the Wind Rhapsody'',<ref name=\"Eye\">[http://www.giltrap.co.uk/index.php?page=cds&display=20&category=03--Dual_Disc_DVD-slash-CD \"Gordon Giltrap and Friends at the Symphony Hall\"], Live Recording (2006), La Cooka Ratcha, Cat. No. LCVP160CD</ref> an orchestral work celebrating the exploration of the New World by British sailing ships. In the 1990s Giltrap played a key role in [[Cliff Richard]]'s ''[[Heathcliff (musical)|Heathcliff]]'' [[musical theatre|musical]], playing the musical [[narrator]]. He also composed a number of pieces for the show.\n\nIn late 2009, Giltrap started \"Three Parts Guitar\", a short tour with the classical guitarist Raymond Burley and the jazz guitarist [[John Etheridge]]. In 2011 this was expanded to \"Four Parts Guitar\" with the addition of guitarist, [[Clive Carroll]]. An album of the same name was released the same year.\n\nFor two years, around 1997,{{when|date=January 2011}} Giltrap wrote a regular acoustic column for ''Total Guitar'' magazine. An anthology of 26 of these articles is published in ''Total Giltrap'',<ref>Giltrap, Gordon (2002). ''Total Giltrap \u2013 Guitar Encounters of the Fingerstyle Kind'', Mel Bay, {{ISBN|0-7866-5676-X}}</ref> a book with an accompanying CD on which he plays the studies and pieces.
