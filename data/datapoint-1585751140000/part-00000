For this reason, a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood-like]] atmosphere was used for ''Silent Hill''. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer [[Akira Yamaoka]], the developers did not know how to proceed with the ''Silent Hill'' project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of ''Silent Hill'' had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|era of lower-budget 2D titles]].

For this reason, a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood-like]] atmosphere was used for ''Silent Hill''. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer [[Akira Yamaoka]], the developers did not know how to proceed with the ''Silent Hill'' project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of ''Silent Hill'' had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|era of lower-budget 2D titles]].
