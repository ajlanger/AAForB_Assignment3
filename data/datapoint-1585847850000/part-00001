The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.<ref name=\"Walker2010\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907\u2013942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}</ref>\n\n===Survey instruments===\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.<ref name=Wendorf2001/><ref name=\"Verplaetse2008\">{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265\u2013286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}</ref> Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes.

Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1\u201345|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}</ref> Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S.

This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA342}}</ref> Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA361 361\u2013362]}} The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self-expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars. They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346\u20131359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=|jstor=1131651}}</ref>\n\n[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79\u2013105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices. He theorized [[Volition (psychology)|willpower]], moral desires, and integrity have the capability for a person to act morally by the hierarchical order of virtues. He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity. He essentially stated that to have the lower virtues, one must have one or more of the higher virtues. The end goals of moral development identity are to establish and act upon core goals, as well as and use one's strengths to make a difference.<ref>{{cite book|title=Character Psychology and Character Education|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-268-03371-2|editor-last=Lapsley|editor-first=Daniel|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|pages=[https://archive.org/details/characterpsychol0000unse/page/67 67\u2013100]|chapter=Moral character: A psychological approach|editor-last2=Power|editor-first2=F.|url=https://archive.org/details/characterpsychol0000unse/page/67}}</ref>\n\n===Moral self===\n\nA \"moral self\" is fostered by mutually responsive [[Parenting styles|parenting]] in childhood.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H. Schwartz]] defines individual values as \"conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g.organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people an events, and explain their actions and evaluations.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=S.

While individual values vary case by case (a result of unique life experience), the average of these values point to widely held cultural beliefs (a result of shared cultural values).\n\n===Moral virtues===\nPiaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

By breaking moral situations down into their defining features, the attachment model of moral judgment outlines a framework for a universal moral faculty based on a universal, innate, deep structure that appears uniformly in the structure of almost all moral judgments regardless of their content.\n\n===Moral behaviour===\n\nHistorically, major topics of study in the domain of moral behavior have included [[violence]] and [[altruism]],<ref name=\"Staub2003\">{{cite book |last1=Staub |first1=Ervin |title=Psychology of good and evil: why children, adults, and groups help and harm others. |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-07031-0}}</ref> [[Bystander effect|bystander intervention]] and obedience to [[authority]] (e.g., the [[Milgram experiment]]<ref name=\"Milgram1963\">{{cite journal|last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=371\u20138 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 |citeseerx=10.1.1.599.92 }}</ref> and [[Stanford prison experiment]]<ref name=\"Haney1972\">{{cite journal |last1=Haney |first1=Craig |last2=Banks |first2=Curtis |last3=Zimbardo |first3=Philip |title=Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison |date=1972 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/751041.pdf}}</ref>).

This [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model of moral motivation<ref>{{harvnb|Leffel|2008}}'s model draws heavily on {{harvnb|Haidt|2001}}'s social intuitionist model of moral judgment.</ref> suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the \"hotter\" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\n====Value-behavior consistency====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing). Individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a deontological manner, however, generally answer more quickly and show brain activity in the [[amygdala]] (associated with emotional processing).\n\n====Moral Foundations Theory====\n{{Main|Moral foundations theory}}\nIn regard to moral intuitions, researchers Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham performed a study to research the difference between the moral foundations of political liberals and political conservatives.<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Graham |first2=Jesse |title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize |journal=Social Justice Research |date=23 May 2007 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=98\u2013116 |doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z}}</ref> Haidt and Graham expanded on previous research done by Shweder and his three ethics theory.

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G.

J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.<ref name=\"Walker2010\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907\u2013942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}</ref>\n\n===Survey instruments===\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.<ref name=Wendorf2001/><ref name=\"Verplaetse2008\">{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265\u2013286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}</ref> Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes.

Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1\u201345|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}</ref> Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S.

This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA342}}</ref> Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA361 361\u2013362]}} The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self-expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars. They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346\u20131359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=|jstor=1131651}}</ref>\n\n[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79\u2013105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices.

He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

[[Lawrence Kohlberg|Lawerence Kohlberg]] sought to expand Piaget's work. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the [[Heinz dilemma]]). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

This [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model of moral motivation<ref>{{harvnb|Leffel|2008}}'s model draws heavily on {{harvnb|Haidt|2001}}'s social intuitionist model of moral judgment.</ref> suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the \"hotter\" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\n====Value-behavior consistency====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing). Individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a deontological manner, however, generally answer more quickly and show brain activity in the [[amygdala]] (associated with emotional processing).\n\n====Moral Foundations Theory====\n{{Main|Moral foundations theory}}\nIn regard to moral intuitions, researchers Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham performed a study to research the difference between the moral foundations of political liberals and political conservatives.<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Graham |first2=Jesse |title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize |journal=Social Justice Research |date=23 May 2007 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=98\u2013116 |doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z}}</ref> Haidt and Graham expanded on previous research done by Shweder and his three ethics theory.

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G.

J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.
