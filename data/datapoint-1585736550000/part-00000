A three-headed monster named [[Geryon]], the grandson of [[Medusa]] (the serpent-haired [[Gorgon]]), is said to have been killed by [[Heracles|Herakles]] to recover a stolen cattle.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=57}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}} The Greek hero is helped by the sun-god [[Helios]], from whom he borrows the cup in order to cross the western Ocean and reach the island of Erythea. Together with his herdsman Eurytion and his dog, Herakles finally overcomes the monster and drives the cattle back to Greece.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}}\n\nRoman versions of myth, which relied on earlier Greek texts, have been remodelled around an opposition between Hercules and a fire-breathing ogre named [[Cacus|C\u0101cus]], living in a cave on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=|pp=56\u201357}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=261}} They have nonetheless retained some features of the original three-headed monstrous opponent: Hercules' club, with which he kills C\u0101cus with three strikes, is said to be three-noded; and Hercules runs around the mountain three times after finding the monster's cave, batters the door three times, and sits down to rest three times before finally breaking in.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=|pp=56\u201357}} Like in the Iranian and Greek versions, C\u0101cus is portrayed as the one who initially stole the cattle which rightfully belongs to the hero, Hercules.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=57}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=261}}\n\n==== Germanic ====\n[[File:Small Gallehus horn images.png|thumb|321x321px|A possible Germanic depiction of the myth of ''*Trito'' on the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]] (second from top).{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=58}}]]\n[[Ymir]] is depicted in the ''[[Edda]]s'' as the primal being and a frost giant. After [[Odin|\u00d3\u00f0inn]] and his brothers killed him, they made the earth out of his flesh, the mountains from his bones, the trees from his hair, the sky from his skull, and the sea and lakes from his blood; and from his two armpits came a man and a woman.{{Sfn|Polom\u00e9|1986|p=472}}{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=285}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=356}} The Germanic name ''Ymir'' meant \"Twin\", and some scholars have proposed that it was also understood as ''hermaphrodite'' or ''bisexual''.

The battle ends with the former tearing his opponent limb from limb, creating the Irish landscape out of his body. Donn himself dies shortly after the fight from a broken heart, and thereafter also gives his body to form the island's landscape.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=35}} [[Julius Caesar]] reported that the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] believed in a mythical ancestor he compared to [[D\u012bs Pater]], the Roman god of the [[underworld]]. According to some scholars, this could represent a reflex of the original Proto-Indo-European twin ancestor and ruler of the dead ''*Yemo'', a function similar to that held by the Indo-Iranian Yama.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=33}}\n\n== Influence ==\nThe motif of Manu and Yemo has been influential throughout Eurasia following the [[Indo-European migrations]].
