According to a 1930 [[Federal Radio Commission]] listing, the station had a power of 100 watts and was licensed to the \"A. J. Kirby Music Company\".  Sometime in the 1930s the station's city of license was changed to Charlotte and the call sign was changed to WSOC, supposedly meaning \"We Serve Our City\".  The 1941 [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] (NARBA) mandated a change in frequency to 1240&nbsp;kHz. In the late 1950s, most stations on \"Class IV\" (local) frequencies were allowed to increase their daytime power to 1,000 watts, and WSOC increased their daytime power as well.  Also in the 1950s the owners of WSOC brought to the air [[WSOC-FM]] at 103.7&nbsp;MHz, and [[WSOC-TV]] on [[VHF]] channel 9.\n\n===Top 40 era===\nOn September 2, 1960, Cox Broadcasting Company, then-owners of WSOC, traded frequencies with WIST at [[WYFQ|930&nbsp;kHz]]<ref>''The Charlotte News'', Sept. 1, 1960, p. 28.</ref>  Under the ownership of [[Cosmos Broadcasting]] and later [[Henderson Belk]] the station gained the WIST legacy of the first true [[Top 40]] station in Charlotte, and by the end of the decade had pioneered the [[Progressive rock]] format in Charlotte as \"The Amazing AM\", but changes were in the works.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  In 1972, the Progressive Rock format was shifted to [[WNKS|WIST-FM]] at 95.1&nbsp;MHz, and their calls were changed to WRNA.<ref>http://www.thatwasradio.com/ways.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507041637/http://www.thatwasradio.com/ways.html |date=2007-05-07 }}, Retrieved on February 28, 2008.</ref>  Belk then sold WIST(AM) to Statesville Broadcasting Company, which gained [[CBS Radio Network]] affiliation for the station and began Charlotte's first [[talk radio]] format on WIST.  Charlotte radio legend [[Jack Knight (radio host)|Jack Knight]] was hired to do the morning show.  Future [[John Boy and Billy]] sidekick [[Robert D. Raiford]] hosted one of the talk shows, and was notorious for screaming at callers.  The format was unsuccessful, and Statesville Broadcasting sold the station by the middle of the 1970s.\n\n===Adult Contemporary turned Country era===\nWIST/1240's next ownership was a partnership between former WBT ad salesman Al Munn and [[Consolidated Theater Corporation]].  Munn initially changed the format to [[Adult contemporary music]] and brought his family into the employ of the station.  Munn also attempted to operate the station as a broadcasting school, eventually separating the school functions into the \"WISTA School of Broadcasting.\"  In 1979 the Charlotte radio landscape had a major change.  Longtime AM [[country music]] leader [[WGFY|WAME]] was purchased by [[Jimmy Swaggart|Jimmy Swaggart Ministries]] and became a [[Christian radio|religious station]].  The country music format hole was quickly filled by WIST, becoming \"Live Country 1240\".  By this time the partnership between Munn and Consolidated Theaters was coming unraveled, and the theater company bought Munn out of the arrangement.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WIST gave country music its last serious attempt on the AM dial in Charlotte, becoming \"The Bright Spot.\"  The format was innovative, but most country listeners had switched to WSOC-FM and the format did not succeed.  As its last gasp, WIST tried Top 40 again in the early 1980s before signing off the air.\n\n===Switch to religious format===\nIn 1983, The station was purchased by George H. Buck, who at that time owned WHVN, which operated daytime-only at 1310&nbsp;kHz.  Originally, 1310 had been WKTC, Charlotte's first country station, before adopting a Christian format in 1971.  WHVN moved to the 1240 frequency, and sold its old frequency to Dick Tomlinson.
