It was privately built in 1871 by the [[Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|3rd Duke of Buckingham]] as a [[Horsecar|horse tram]] line to help transport goods between his lands around [[Wotton House]] and the national rail network. Lobbying from the nearby village of [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought but trains still travelled at an average speed of {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}.\n\nIn 1883, the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to [[Oxford]], creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite the backing of the wealthy [[Ferdinand de Rothschild]], investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.\n\nThe existing line had been upgraded in 1894, but the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.\n\nIn 1933 the Metropolitan Railway became the [[Metropolitan line]] of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]. The Brill Tramway became part of the London Underground, despite Quainton Road being {{convert|40|mi|km}} from London and not underground. London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in London and saw little possibility that passenger routes in Buckinghamshire could become viable. In 1935 the Brill Tramway closed. The infrastructure was dismantled and sold. Little trace remains other than the former [[junction station]] at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]], now the [[Buckinghamshire Railway Centre]].\n[[File:Brill tramway system diagram.png|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The full extent of the Brill Tramway system.

Large numbers of bricks from Poore's Brickworks at Brill were shipped.

The Winchendon Branch closed and the track was removed.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\n===Brill Brick and Tile Works===\nAlthough Poore's Brickworks was well established, Jones believed there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=49}} Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10&nbsp;million bricks a year.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=49\u201350}} It was decided that 5&nbsp;million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=50}} Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nFew records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it came to be called, but it was operational by 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=21}} Jones (1974) says the siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=6}} This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}} The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}\n\nBrill Brick and Tile Works could not compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at [[Calvert, Buckinghamshire|Calvert]] and declined.{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=111}}{{refn|In 1899 the [[Great Central Railway]] mainline from London to Manchester was built, running directly past the brickworks at Calvert.

The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=19}} Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.&nbsp;G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A&B. The A&B's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}} Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}}\n\nJones sought legal advice and was told that the Duke would probably win a legal action against the A&BR. The A&BR was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} From its peak of 20,994&nbsp;tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139&nbsp;tons (9,286&nbsp;t) in 1881.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=30}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=26em|salign=right|quote=Once the train had stopped {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} short of the station, and looking out after a long wait I saw the engine far away.

It was privately built in 1871 by the [[Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|3rd Duke of Buckingham]] as a [[Horsecar|horse tram]] line to help transport goods between his lands around [[Wotton House]] and the national rail network. Lobbying from the nearby village of [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought but trains still travelled at an average speed of {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}.\n\nIn 1883, the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to [[Oxford]], creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite the backing of the wealthy [[Ferdinand de Rothschild]], investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.\n\nThe existing line had been upgraded in 1894, but the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.\n\nIn 1933 the Metropolitan Railway became the [[Metropolitan line]] of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]. The Brill Tramway became part of the London Underground, despite Quainton Road being {{convert|40|mi|km}} from London and not underground. London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in London and saw little possibility that passenger routes in Buckinghamshire could become viable. In 1935 the Brill Tramway closed. The infrastructure was dismantled and sold. Little trace remains other than the former [[junction station]] at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]], now the [[Buckinghamshire Railway Centre]].\n[[File:Brill tramway system diagram.png|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The full extent of the Brill Tramway system.

Nobody at Wotton could operate the locomotive so a horse had to be hired from Aylesbury until the driver arrived.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=29}} After the delivery of the second locomotive on 7 September 1872, all passenger services were drawn by locomotive except on Thursdays, when locomotives were replaced by horses to allow for maintenance.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=18}} The line carried 104 passengers in January 1872, rising to 224 in April,{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=11}} and 456 in August 1872.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=15}}\n\nWith steam came the need for water. Plans to dig a well near Wotton came to nothing, and the Duke's expedient of drawing water from a pond near Quainton Road did not impress the pond's owner.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=15}} By March 1872 Jones recorded that \"The party to whom the pond near the Quainton Station belongs is making complaints about our having water and I expect he will be using force to prevent our getting any\".{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=15}} A wooden water tower was built at Brill station, and a large water tower known as the Black Tank was built in the fork of the main line and Church Siding.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=15}}{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=95}}\n\nWhile the engines proved adequate, they were slow.

The [[chalybeate spring]]s of [[Dorton Spa]] outside Brill were known for supposed healing powers,{{sfn|Sheahan|1862|p=376}} and a resort had been built around the Spa in the 1830s,{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=111}} featuring a modern pump house and eight baths, set in {{convert|12|acre}} of parkland.{{sfn|Sheahan|1862|p=377}} Despite the redevelopment and the building of modern hotels in Brill, Dorton Spa was unfashionable and by the late 19th century was little used.{{sfn|Sheahan|1862|p=377}} Jones and the Spa's owners hoped Queen Victoria would visit during her 1890 stay at Waddesdon Manor and thus boost Brill as a spa town. Although such a visit was arranged, Victoria changed her mind and visited the spa at [[Cheltenham]] instead.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}} The spa traffic never materialised.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}\n\n===Waddesdon Manor===\n[[File:WaddesdonManor.JPG|right|thumb|The Tramway was heavily used during the construction of Waddesdon Manor.|alt=large two-storey brick building with a number of large pointed turrets on the roof]]\nIn 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild began work on Waddesdon Manor, a short distance south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road).{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill to provide access to the construction site.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and [[Westcott railway station|Westcott]] stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a [[cable tram]] ran on [[narrow gauge]] rails up the hill to a [[gully]] close to the building site.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}{{refn|The gully remains, but no other trace of the branch to Waddesdon Manor has survived.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}|group=note}} Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch.{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=78}} The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\nThe building of Waddesdon Manor generated huge business for the Tramway. Large numbers of bricks from Poore's Brickworks at Brill were shipped. By July 1877 the entire output of the brickworks was going to supply the Waddesdon Manor works, with 25,000 bricks a week being used.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Additional bricks were also shipped via Quainton Road, {{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} along with 7,000&nbsp;tons (7,100&nbsp;t) of [[Bath Stone]] from [[Corsham]].{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=78}} The manor also required power and in 1883 a [[gasworks]] was built to the west. A siding from Westcott station ran south to the gasworks, to carry coal.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Waddesdon Manor chose not to use the Tramway for supplying coal to the gasworks and the siding was abandoned in 1886.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\nWaddesdon Manor was complete in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch closed and the track was removed.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\n===Brill Brick and Tile Works===\nAlthough Poore's Brickworks was well established, Jones believed there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=49}} Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10&nbsp;million bricks a year.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=49\u201350}} It was decided that 5&nbsp;million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=50}} Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nFew records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it came to be called, but it was operational by 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=21}} Jones (1974) says the siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=6}} This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}} The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}\n\nBrill Brick and Tile Works could not compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at [[Calvert, Buckinghamshire|Calvert]] and declined.{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=111}}{{refn|In 1899 the [[Great Central Railway]] mainline from London to Manchester was built, running directly past the brickworks at Calvert.

The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=19}} Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.&nbsp;G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A&B. The A&B's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}} Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}}\n\nJones sought legal advice and was told that the Duke would probably win a legal action against the A&BR. The A&BR was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} From its peak of 20,994&nbsp;tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139&nbsp;tons (9,286&nbsp;t) in 1881.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=30}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=26em|salign=right|quote=Once the train had stopped {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} short of the station, and looking out after a long wait I saw the engine far away.
