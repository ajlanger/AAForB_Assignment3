They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the [[Marxist]] [[communism]] tradition.\n\nThe formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] within the [[Communist International]]. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in [[one-party states]] like the [[Communist Party of China]] or the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or as ruling parties in [[multi-party system]]s, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.\n\nMany other communist parties did not govern any country, but they did govern several states or region within a particular countries.
