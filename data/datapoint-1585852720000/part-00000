During this time, [[Devil in Christianity |Satan]] came to Jesus and tried to tempt him. Jesus having refused each temptation, Satan then departed and Jesus returned to [[Galilee]] to begin his ministry.

Barrett sees this as a temptation to accept the adulation of the crowds, assume leadership of the nation to overthrow Roman rule, take the crown of his own nation, and from there initiate the kingdom of God on earth. The kingdoms Jesus would inherit through Satan are obtained through love of power and political oppression. Barrett characterizes this \"the old but ever new temptation to do evil that good may come; to justify the illegitimacy of the means by the greatness of the end.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/temptationchris00barrgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/temptationchris00barrgoog/page/n63 48] |quote=temptation of christ. |title=Barrett, George, Slatyer.

It is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and only Him shall you serve.'\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|4:10}}, New American Bible</ref>  (referencing Deuteronomy 6:13 and 10:20).

While both Mark and Matthew mention the angels, Luke does not, and Matthew seems once again here to be making parallels with [[Elijah]],<ref>1 Kings 19:4\u20139</ref> who was fed by [[raven]]s. The word ''ministered'' or ''served'' is often interpreted as the [[angels]] feeding [[Jesus]], and traditionally artists have depicted the scene as Jesus being presented with a feast, a detailed description of it even appearing in ''[[Paradise Regained]]''. This ending to the temptation narrative may be a common literary device of using a feast scene to emphasize a happy ending,<ref name=\"Clarke, Howard W. 2003\"/> or it may be proof that Jesus never lost his faith in God during the temptations.<ref name=\"Jones, Alexander 1965\"/>\n\n==Gospel of Mark==\nThe Mark ({{bibleverse-nb|Mark|1:12\u201313|KJV}}) account is very brief. Most of the Mark account is found also in the Matthew and Luke versions, with the exception of the statement that Jesus was \"with the wild animals.\" Despite the lack of actual text shared among the three texts, the language and interpretations Mark uses draw comparison among the three Gospels. The Greek verb Mark uses in the text is synonymous with driving out demons, and the wilderness at times represents a place of struggle.<ref>{{cite book|jstor = j.ctt9m0t6h.8|title = Prologue to Mark's Gospel (1:1-15)|pages = 23\u201334|last1 = Jacobsen|first1 = David Schnasa|year = 2014|isbn = 9780800699239|publisher = Augsburg Fortress, Publishers}}</ref> The two verses in Mark used to describe Jesus' Temptation quickly progress him into his career as a preacher.\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that Jesus allowed himself to be tempted as both an example and a warning. He cites Sirach 2: \"Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.\" Following this, he cites [[Hebrews 4:15]]: \"We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.\"<ref>[https://www.americamagazine.org/content/ignatian-educator/why-did-christ-allow-himself-be-tempted Emerson, Matt. \"Why Did Christ Allow Himself to be Tempted?\", ''America'', February 23, 2015]</ref>\n\n==Gospel of John==\nThe temptation of Christ is not found in the Gospel of John. However some readers have identified parallels inside John which indicate that the author of John may have been familiar with the Temptation narratives in some form.<ref>Whittaker H.A., ''Studies in the Gospels'', Biblia, 1996 p. 319</ref>\n* Stones into Bread: John 6:26, 31 to make bread in the wilderness.\n* Jump from the temple: John 2:18 to perform a Messianic sign in the temple.\n* Kingdoms of the World: John 6:15 to take the kingdom by force.\n\n==Catholic interpretations==\n[[File:Simon Bening - The Temptation of Christ.jpg|thumb|''The Temptation of Christ'', by [[Simon Bening]]]] \nTaken in the sense of denoting enticement to evil, temptation cannot be referred directly to God or to Christ.  For instance in Gen. 12.1, \"God tempted Abraham\", and in John 6.6, \"This [Jesus] said tempting [Philip]\", the expressions must be taken in the sense of testing, or trying. According to St. James, the source of man's temptations is his proneness to evil which is the result of the fall of Adam, and which remains in human nature after baptismal regeneration, and even though the soul is in the state of sanctifying grace, mankind\u2019s concupiscence (or proneness to evil) becomes sinful only when freely yielded to; when resisted with God's help it is an occasion of merit. The chief cause of temptation is Satan, \"the tempter\", bent on man's eternal ruin.<ref name=Gigot />\n\nIn the Lord's Prayer, the clause \"Lead us not into temptation\" is a humble and trusting petition for God's help to enable us to overcome temptation when His Fatherly Providence allows us to experience the allurements of evil. Prayer and watchfulness are the chief weapons against temptation. God does not allow man to be tempted beyond his strength. Like Adam, Christ (the second Adam) endured temptation only from without, inasmuch as His human nature was free from all concupiscence; but unlike Adam, Christ withstood the assaults of the Tempter on all points, thereby providing a perfect model of resistance to mankind\u2019s spiritual enemy, and a permanent source of victorious help.<ref name=Gigot/> \n\nIn the first three Gospels, the narrative of Christ's temptation is placed in immediate connection with His baptism and then with the beginning of His public ministry. The reason for this is clear. The Synoptists regarded the baptism of Christ as the external designation of Jesus from [the Father] for Christ\u2019s Messianic work under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The first three Gospels agree concerning the time to which they assign the temptation of Christ, so they are at one in ascribing the same general place to its occurrence, viz. \"the desert\", whereby they [probably] mean the Wilderness of Judea, where Jesus would be, as St. Mark says: \"with beasts\".<ref name=Gigot/> \n\n\"The Biblical meaning of temptation is 'a trial in which man has a free choice of being faithful or unfaithful to God'. Satan encouraged Jesus to deviate from the plan of his father by misusing his authority and privileges. Jesus used the Holy Scripture to resist all such temptation. When we are tempted, the solution is to be sought in the Bible.\"<ref>[http://www.stthomasdiocese.org/article/sunday-reflection-jesus-overcomes-temptation-feb-11-2018 Mutholath, Abraham. \"Jesus Overcomes Temptation\"], St. Thomas SyroMalabar Catholic Diocese of Chicago, February 11, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn the temptations, according to [[Benedict XVI]], Satan seeks to draw Jesus from a messianism of self-sacrifice to a messianism of power: \"in this period of \"wilderness\"\u2026 Jesus is exposed to danger and is assaulted by the temptation and seduction of the Evil One, who proposes a different messianic path to him, far from God's plan because it passes through power, success and domination rather than the total gift of himself on the Cross.

Barrett sees this as a temptation to accept the adulation of the crowds, assume leadership of the nation to overthrow Roman rule, take the crown of his own nation, and from there initiate the kingdom of God on earth. The kingdoms Jesus would inherit through Satan are obtained through love of power and political oppression. Barrett characterizes this \"the old but ever new temptation to do evil that good may come; to justify the illegitimacy of the means by the greatness of the end.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/temptationchris00barrgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/temptationchris00barrgoog/page/n63 48] |quote=temptation of christ. |title=Barrett, George, Slatyer.

While both Mark and Matthew mention the angels, Luke does not, and Matthew seems once again here to be making parallels with [[Elijah]],<ref>1 Kings 19:4\u20139</ref> who was fed by [[raven]]s. The word ''ministered'' or ''served'' is often interpreted as the [[angels]] feeding [[Jesus]], and traditionally artists have depicted the scene as Jesus being presented with a feast, a detailed description of it even appearing in ''[[Paradise Regained]]''. This ending to the temptation narrative may be a common literary device of using a feast scene to emphasize a happy ending,<ref name=\"Clarke, Howard W. 2003\"/> or it may be proof that Jesus never lost his faith in God during the temptations.<ref name=\"Jones, Alexander 1965\"/>\n\n==Gospel of Mark==\nThe Mark ({{bibleverse-nb|Mark|1:12\u201313|KJV}}) account is very brief. Most of the Mark account is found also in the Matthew and Luke versions, with the exception of the statement that Jesus was \"with the wild animals.\" Despite the lack of actual text shared among the three texts, the language and interpretations Mark uses draw comparison among the three Gospels. The Greek verb Mark uses in the text is synonymous with driving out demons, and the wilderness at times represents a place of struggle.<ref>{{cite book|jstor = j.ctt9m0t6h.8|title = Prologue to Mark's Gospel (1:1-15)|pages = 23\u201334|last1 = Jacobsen|first1 = David Schnasa|year = 2014|isbn = 9780800699239|publisher = Augsburg Fortress, Publishers}}</ref> The two verses in Mark used to describe Jesus' Temptation quickly progress him into his career as a preacher.\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that Jesus allowed himself to be tempted as both an example and a warning. He cites Sirach 2: \"Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.\" Following this, he cites [[Hebrews 4:15]]: \"We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.\"<ref>[https://www.americamagazine.org/content/ignatian-educator/why-did-christ-allow-himself-be-tempted Emerson, Matt. \"Why Did Christ Allow Himself to be Tempted?\", ''America'', February 23, 2015]</ref>\n\n==Gospel of John==\nThe temptation of Christ is not found in the Gospel of John. However some readers have identified parallels inside John which indicate that the author of John may have been familiar with the Temptation narratives in some form.<ref>Whittaker H.A., ''Studies in the Gospels'', Biblia, 1996 p. 319</ref>\n* Stones into Bread: John 6:26, 31 to make bread in the wilderness.\n* Jump from the temple: John 2:18 to perform a Messianic sign in the temple.\n* Kingdoms of the World: John 6:15 to take the kingdom by force.\n\n==Catholic interpretations==\n[[File:Simon Bening - The Temptation of Christ.jpg|thumb|''The Temptation of Christ'', by [[Simon Bening]]]] \nTaken in the sense of denoting enticement to evil, temptation cannot be referred directly to God or to Christ.  For instance in Gen. 12.1, \"God tempted Abraham\", and in John 6.6, \"This [Jesus] said tempting [Philip]\", the expressions must be taken in the sense of testing, or trying. According to St. James, the source of man's temptations is his proneness to evil which is the result of the fall of Adam, and which remains in human nature after baptismal regeneration, and even though the soul is in the state of sanctifying grace, mankind\u2019s concupiscence (or proneness to evil) becomes sinful only when freely yielded to; when resisted with God's help it is an occasion of merit. The chief cause of temptation is Satan, \"the tempter\", bent on man's eternal ruin.<ref name=Gigot />\n\nIn the Lord's Prayer, the clause \"Lead us not into temptation\" is a humble and trusting petition for God's help to enable us to overcome temptation when His Fatherly Providence allows us to experience the allurements of evil. Prayer and watchfulness are the chief weapons against temptation. God does not allow man to be tempted beyond his strength. Like Adam, Christ (the second Adam) endured temptation only from without, inasmuch as His human nature was free from all concupiscence; but unlike Adam, Christ withstood the assaults of the Tempter on all points, thereby providing a perfect model of resistance to mankind\u2019s spiritual enemy, and a permanent source of victorious help.<ref name=Gigot/> \n\nIn the first three Gospels, the narrative of Christ's temptation is placed in immediate connection with His baptism and then with the beginning of His public ministry. The reason for this is clear. The Synoptists regarded the baptism of Christ as the external designation of Jesus from [the Father] for Christ\u2019s Messianic work under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The first three Gospels agree concerning the time to which they assign the temptation of Christ, so they are at one in ascribing the same general place to its occurrence, viz. \"the desert\", whereby they [probably] mean the Wilderness of Judea, where Jesus would be, as St. Mark says: \"with beasts\".<ref name=Gigot/> \n\n\"The Biblical meaning of temptation is 'a trial in which man has a free choice of being faithful or unfaithful to God'. Satan encouraged Jesus to deviate from the plan of his father by misusing his authority and privileges. Jesus used the Holy Scripture to resist all such temptation. When we are tempted, the solution is to be sought in the Bible.\"<ref>[http://www.stthomasdiocese.org/article/sunday-reflection-jesus-overcomes-temptation-feb-11-2018 Mutholath, Abraham. \"Jesus Overcomes Temptation\"], St. Thomas SyroMalabar Catholic Diocese of Chicago, February 11, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn the temptations, according to [[Benedict XVI]], Satan seeks to draw Jesus from a messianism of self-sacrifice to a messianism of power: \"in this period of \"wilderness\"\u2026 Jesus is exposed to danger and is assaulted by the temptation and seduction of the Evil One, who proposes a different messianic path to him, far from God's plan because it passes through power, success and domination rather than the total gift of himself on the Cross. This is the alternative: a messianism of power, of success, or a messianism of love, of the gift of self.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20120222_en.html |title=General Audience |publisher= Vatican |date = 2012-02-22 |accessdate= 2014-05-16}}</ref>\n\n{{Synthesis|section|date=July 2011}}\nJesus was tempted three times.\nThe temptations were [[hedonism]] (hunger/satisfaction), [[egoism]] (spectacular throw/might) and [[Economic materialism|materialism]] (kingdoms/wealth).
