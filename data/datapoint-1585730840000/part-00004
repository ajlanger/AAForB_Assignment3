The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of the word '[[myna]]' and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex social groups.  Within each group there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds who are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests in the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'' which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of the word '[[myna]]' and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex social groups.  Within each group there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds who are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests in the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'' which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The primary breeding season is April/May to August/September in the northern part of their range and June/July to November/December in the southern range,<ref name=\"NestEgg\" /> but breeding has been observed in all months of the year<ref name=\"SocialOrganization\" /><ref name=\"ReproductiveBehavior\">{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=MF|title=The Reproductive Behavior of the Bell Miner|journal=Emu|date=1988|volume=88|issue=2|pages=88\u2013100|doi=10.1071/MU9880088}}</ref> as females will often nest again after a failed nest or once the young have fledged. One female was recorded nesting five times in one season, though that many nest attempts is unusual.<ref name=\"SocialOrganization\" /> Bell miner pairs are monogamous, but the breeding tasks are divided between the sexes. Female bell miners build the nest over 8 days, incubate the 1-3 (but typically 2) eggs for 14.5 days, and brood the young for up to 12 days depending on the weather.<ref name=\"ReproductiveBehavior\" /> The nests are small, cup-shaped and built with dry twigs, grasses, and bark woven together with spider web.<ref name=\"NestEgg\" /> Nests are generally hidden in the foliage of dense understory plants, 3-5m above the ground.<ref name=\"NestEgg\" /> The eggs are typically 24mm x 16mm, oval shaped, and pink in color. They have darker reddish brown spots and blotches primarily over the larger end.<ref name=\"NestEgg\" /> Pallid cuckoos have been recorded as nest parasites for bell miners.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swainson|first1=G.W.|title=Co-operative rearing in the Bell Miner|journal=Emu|date=1970|volume=70|issue=4|pages=183\u2013188|doi=10.1071/MU970183}}</ref>\n\nWhile nests are all within the territory of the colony, they are not tightly packed as traditional colony breeders. Instead nests are located within the breeding pairs' normal foraging range. They are generally within calling range of neighbour nests, but not too close.<ref name=\"SpacialOrg\">{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=MF|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=GF|title=Spatial-Organization of the Cooperatively Breeding Bell Miner|journal=Emu|date=1994|volume=94|issue=2|pages=96|doi=10.1071/MU9940096}}</ref> Female bell miners move nest locations after a nest failure and were observed to move nests lower into the thick understory, likely reducing the risk of avian predators. However, they did not move nests far from the original location horizontally, possibly to stay within their home foraging range and to retain their established set of helpers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beckmann|first1=Christa|last2=McDonald|first2=Paul G.|title=Placement of Re-nests Following Predation: Are Birds Managing Risk?|journal=Emu|date=2016|volume=116|pages=9\u201313|doi=10.1071/mu15064}}</ref> Females will also alter brood sex ratios to meet conditions. When a colony is in a new location with an inferior food source the ratio will be biased towards more females which will disperse from the colony at sexual maturity.

Juvenile birds start helping as early as 1.3 months old.<ref name=\"HANZAB:Honeyeaters\" /> Older non-breeding males contribute the most food to nestlings and assist with multiple nests.<ref name=\"Ethology\" /> The amount of help offered by a nest helper is correlated with its genetic relationship with the nestlings it is feeding.<ref name=\"KinSelection\" /> Bell miners use a provisioning call when they arrive at the nest to stimulate the young to beg.
