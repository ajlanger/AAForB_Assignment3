Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra [[butterfat]] and [[powdered milk]]. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In [[Iceland]], a similar product named [[skyr]] is made.\n\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in Britain as \"Greek-style yoghurt\",<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25954228 BBC:'Greek' yoghurt Chobani firm loses legal battle, 29 January 2014]. In Britain the name \"Greek\" may only be applied to yoghurt made in Greece</ref> though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine|Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid [[curdling]] at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as [[pectin]], [[locust bean gum]], starches or [[guar gum]], listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the [[lactose]], strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.<ref name=\"mother\"/>\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion US yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP7fc6a591c5894845953163cf3e221c52.html |title=Greek yogurt on a marathon-like growth spur|work= Wall Street Journal|agency= Associated Press|date= 22 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=Neuman>{{cite news|author=Neuman, William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/business/demand-for-greek-style-helps-form-a-yogurt-cluster-in-new-york.html |title=Greek Yogurt a Boon for New York State|work=The New York Times|date= 12 January 2012}}</ref> In the US there is no legal definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\" even though it is not necessarily strained yogurt.<ref name=theKitchn>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/greek-yogurt-wars-high-tech-shortcuts-vs-purists-174420 |title=Greek Yogurt Wars: The High-Tech Shortcuts vs. The Purists|website=theKitchn|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Variations by area==\n===Asia===\n====Central Asia====\nIn the cuisines of many [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples (e.g. in [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]], [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]], [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], and other [[Central Asian cuisine]]s), a type of strained yogurt called ''chak(k)a''<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Meyer\n | first = Arthur L.\n | authorlink =\n | author2=Jon M.

It is usually used for making dips served with dates, or served as a side dish. It is also dried and preserved for winter use.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Middle East====\nStrained yogurt is known as ''labneh'' (''labna'', ''labni'', ''lebni'', or ''labani''; Arabic: \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0629) in the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under [[olive oil]]. Labneh is a popular [[mezze]] dish and [[sandwich]] ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from [[cow's milk]] has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of [[olive oil]] topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nIn [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]],  [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">Debra Kamin. [http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/tourist-tip-of-the-day/tourist-tip-242-labneh.premium-1.525323 Tourist tip #242:Labheh]. [[Haaretz]]</ref> It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to [[hummus]], spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend [[za'atar]].\n\n[[Bedouin]] also produce a dry, hard labneh (''labaneh malboudeh'', similar to Central Asian [[Kashk|qurut]]) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with [[khubz]] (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nLabneh is the main ingredient in [[jameed]], which is in turn used in [[mansaf]], the national dish of [[Jordan]].\n\n''Labaneh bil zayit'', \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or arish, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634}}) is a type of cheese that originated in [[Egypt]].

Kept for a couple of hours in its [[clay]] pot, some of the water evaporates through the unglazed clay's pores. It also cools the curd due to evaporation.\n\nBut true strained yogurt, ''chakka'', is made by draining the yogurt in a (preferably muslin) cloth.

Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra [[butterfat]] and [[powdered milk]]. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In [[Iceland]], a similar product named [[skyr]] is made.\n\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in Britain as \"Greek-style yoghurt\",<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25954228 BBC:'Greek' yoghurt Chobani firm loses legal battle, 29 January 2014]. In Britain the name \"Greek\" may only be applied to yoghurt made in Greece</ref> though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine|Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid [[curdling]] at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as [[pectin]], [[locust bean gum]], starches or [[guar gum]], listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the [[lactose]], strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.<ref name=\"mother\"/>\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion US yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP7fc6a591c5894845953163cf3e221c52.html |title=Greek yogurt on a marathon-like growth spur|work= Wall Street Journal|agency= Associated Press|date= 22 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=Neuman>{{cite news|author=Neuman, William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/business/demand-for-greek-style-helps-form-a-yogurt-cluster-in-new-york.html |title=Greek Yogurt a Boon for New York State|work=The New York Times|date= 12 January 2012}}</ref> In the US there is no legal definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\" even though it is not necessarily strained yogurt.<ref name=theKitchn>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/greek-yogurt-wars-high-tech-shortcuts-vs-purists-174420 |title=Greek Yogurt Wars: The High-Tech Shortcuts vs. The Purists|website=theKitchn|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Variations by area==\n===Asia===\n====Central Asia====\nIn the cuisines of many [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples (e.g. in [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]], [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]], [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], and other [[Central Asian cuisine]]s), a type of strained yogurt called ''chak(k)a''<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Meyer\n | first = Arthur L.\n | authorlink =\n | author2=Jon M.

Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under [[olive oil]]. Labneh is a popular [[mezze]] dish and [[sandwich]] ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from [[cow's milk]] has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of [[olive oil]] topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nIn [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]],  [[Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">Debra Kamin. [http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/tourist-tip-of-the-day/tourist-tip-242-labneh.premium-1.525323 Tourist tip #242:Labheh]. [[Haaretz]]</ref> It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to [[hummus]], spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend [[za'atar]].\n\n[[Bedouin]] also produce a dry, hard labneh (''labaneh malboudeh'', similar to Central Asian [[Kashk|qurut]]) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with [[khubz]] (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nLabneh is the main ingredient in [[jameed]], which is in turn used in [[mansaf]], the national dish of [[Jordan]].\n\n''Labaneh bil zayit'', \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or arish, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634}}) is a type of cheese that originated in [[Egypt]].

Kept for a couple of hours in its [[clay]] pot, some of the water evaporates through the unglazed clay's pores. It also cools the curd due to evaporation.\n\nBut true strained yogurt, ''chakka'', is made by draining the yogurt in a (preferably muslin) cloth. [[Shrikhand]] is a dish made with chakka, sugar, [[saffron]], [[cardamom]], pureed or diced fruit and nuts mixed in; it is often eaten with [[Puri (food)|poori]]. It is particularly popular in the states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]], where dairy producers market shrikhand in containers.\n\n''Chakka'' is also eaten in [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]-dominated regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan with rice and meat dishes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Laura|title=The Silk Road Gourmet: Western and Southern Asia|date=2009|publisher=iUniverse|location=New York|isbn=9781440143052|page=191|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NrANvuIMjeEC|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n====Eastern Europe====\n=====Albania=====\nIn [[Albanian cuisine|Albania]], strained yogurt is called \"salc\u00eb kosi\". After preparing yogurt from micro-cultured milk, it is drained in a cloth sack from few hours, to overnight. The water released from this process is called \"hirr\u00eb\" and can be used to preserve cheese or as a drink.  Meanwhile, the strained yogurt is used in many variation in the [[Albanian cuisine|Albanian]] cuisine and is eaten either plain or with added elements such as dill, garlic, cucumber, nuts or olive oil.\n\n=====Bulgaria=====\nIn [[Bulgarian cuisine|Bulgaria]], where yogurt is considered to be an integral part of the national cuisine, strained yogurt is called \"tsedeno kiselo mlyako\" ({{lang-bg|\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043c\u043b\u044f\u043a\u043e}}), and is used in a variety of salads and dressings. Another similar product is \"katak\"  ({{lang-bg|\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044a\u043a}}), which is often made from sheep or goat milk.\n\n===== Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Croatia =====\nA variety of strained yogurt called \"basa\" is a traditional variety of cheese from the region of [[Lika]] in Croatia.\n\nIn Serbia and North Macedonia, it is also known as kiselo mleko (\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e).\n\n====Southern Europe====\n=====Cyprus=====\nAs in Greece, strained yogurt is widely used in [[Cypriot cuisine]] both as an ingredient in recipes as well as on its own or as a supplement to a dish. In Cyprus, strained yogurt is usually made from sheep's milk.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=====Greece=====\n[[File:Tzatziki Greek meze or appetizer, also used as a sauce.jpg|thumb|[[Tzatziki]], a popular [[meze]] in Greece]]\nStrained yogurt ({{Lang-el|\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9|translit=strangist\u00f3 giao\u00farti}}) is used in [[Greek cuisine|Greek food]] mostly as the base for [[tzatziki]] dip and as a dessert, with [[honey]], [[Sour Cherry|sour cherry syrup]], or [[spoon sweets]] often served on top.

Like other types of soured dairy products, ymer is often consumed at breakfast. Strained yogurt topped with [[muesli]] and [[maple syrup]] is often served at [[brunch]] in caf\u00e9s in Denmark.\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nStrained yogurt is known as ''hangop'', literally meaning 'hang up'. It is a traditional dessert. ''Hangop'' may also be made using buttermilk.\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] strained yogurt can only be marketed as \"Greek\" if made in Greece. Strained cows'-milk yogurt not made in Greece is typically sold as \"Greek style\" or \"Greek recipe\" for marketing reasons, typically at lower prices than yogurt made in Greece. Among \"Greek style\" yogurts there is no distinction between those thickened by straining and those thickened through additives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/630.html|title=Fage UK Ltd & Anor v Chobani UK Ltd & Anor [2013] EWHC 630 (Ch) (26 March 2013)|work=bailii.org \u00a77}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2012 Chobani UK Ltd. began to sell yogurt made in the United States as \"Greek yogurt\".

Both companies relied on surveys to prove their point; FAGE also relied on the previous industry practice of UK yogurt makers not to label their yogurt as \"Greek yogurt\".
