The vagus nerves are normally referred to in the singular. It is the longest nerve of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the [[human body]].  The ending part of the vagus nerve is known as the [[nucleus ambiguus]].<ref name=\"Walker\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=H.

Besides giving some output to various organs, the vagus nerve comprises between 80% and 90% of [[afferent nerve]]s mostly conveying [[sense|sensory]] information about the state of the body's organs to the [[central nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berthoud HR, Neuhuber WL | title = Functional and chemical anatomy of the afferent vagal system | journal = Autonomic Neuroscience | volume = 85 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 1\u201317 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11189015 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S1566-0702(00)00215-0 }}</ref>\nThe right and left vagus nerves descend from the cranial vault through the jugular foramina, penetrating the carotid sheath between the internal and external carotid arteries, then passing posterolateral to the common carotid artery.  The cell bodies of [[General visceral afferent fibers|visceral afferent]] fibers of the vagus nerve are located bilaterally in the [[Inferior ganglion of vagus nerve|inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve]] (nodose ganglia).\n\nThe right vagus nerve gives rise to the right [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], which hooks around the right [[subclavian artery]] and ascends into the neck between the [[trachea]] and [[esophagus]].  The right vagus then crosses anterior to the right subclavian artery, runs posterior to the [[superior vena cava]], descends posterior to the [[right main bronchus]], and contributes to [[cardiac plexus|cardiac]], [[pulmonary plexus|pulmonary]], and [[esophageal plexus]]es.  It forms the [[posterior vagal trunk]] at the lower part of the esophagus and enters the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] through the [[esophageal hiatus]].\n\nThe left vagus nerve enters the thorax between [[left common carotid artery]] and left subclavian artery and descends on the [[aortic arch]].  It gives rise to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which hooks around the aortic arch to the left of the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] and ascends between the trachea and esophagus.  The left vagus further gives off thoracic cardiac branches, breaks up into the pulmonary plexus, continues into the esophageal plexus, and enters the abdomen as the [[anterior vagal trunk]] in the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.\n\n===Branches===\n* [[Pharyngeal branch of vagus nerve|Pharyngeal nerve]]\n* [[Superior laryngeal nerve]]\n* [[Superior cervical cardiac branches of vagus nerve]]\n* [[Inferior cervical cardiac branch]]\n* [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]]\n* Thoracic cardiac branches\n* Branches to the [[pulmonary plexus]]\n* Branches to the [[esophageal plexus]]\n* [[Anterior vagal trunk]]\n* [[Posterior vagal trunk]]\n* [[Hering-Breuer reflex]] in alveoli<ref name=\"DutschmannBautista2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutschmann M, Bautista TG, M\u00f6rschel M, Dick TE | title = Learning to breathe: habituation of Hering-Breuer inflation reflex emerges with postnatal brainstem maturation | journal = Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology | volume = 195 | pages = 44\u20139 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24566392 | pmc = 4111629 | doi = 10.1016/j.resp.2014.02.009 }}</ref>\n\nThe vagus runs parallel to the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein inside the carotid sheath.\n\n===Nuclei===\nThe vagus nerve includes [[axon]]s which emerge from or converge onto four [[cranial nerve nucleus|nuclei]] of the medulla:\n# The [[dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve]]  \u2013 which sends [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] output to the viscera, especially the intestines\n# The [[nucleus ambiguus]] \u2013 which gives rise to the branchial efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve and preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that innervate the heart\n# The [[solitary nucleus]] \u2013 which receives afferent taste information and primary afferents from visceral organs\n# The [[spinal trigeminal nucleus]] \u2013 which receives information about deep/crude touch, pain, and temperature of the outer ear, the [[dura mater|dura]] of the [[posterior cranial fossa]] and the mucosa of the larynx\n\n==Development==\nThe [[motor system|motor]] division of the vagus nerve is derived from the [[Basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] of the [[embryo]]nic [[medulla oblongata]], while the [[sensory system|sensory]] division originates from the [[cranial neural crest]].\n\n== Function ==\nThe vagus nerve supplies motor [[parasympathetic]] fibers to all the organs (except the [[adrenal]] glands), from the [[neck]] down to the second segment of the [[transverse colon]].

Vagal and spinal ganglionic nerves mediate the lowering of the [[heart rate]]. The right vagus branch innervates the [[sinoatrial node]]. In healthy people, parasympathetic tone from these sources are well-matched to sympathetic tone. Hyperstimulation of parasympathetic influence promotes [[bradyarrhythmias]]. When hyperstimulated, the left vagal branch predisposes the heart to [[heart block|conduction block]] at the [[atrioventricular node]].\n\nAt this location, neuroscientist [[Otto Loewi]] first demonstrated that nerves secrete substances called [[neurotransmitters]], which have effects on receptors in target tissues. In his experiment, Loewi electrically stimulated the vagus nerve of a frog heart, which slowed the heart. Then he took the fluid from the heart and transferred it to a second frog heart without a vagus nerve. The second heart slowed down without an electrical stimulation. Loewi described the substance released by the vagus nerve as [[vagusstoff]], which was later found to be [[acetylcholine]]. Drugs that inhibit the [[muscarinic receptor]]s ([[anticholinergic]]s) such as [[atropine]] and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], are called vagolytic because they inhibit the action of the vagus nerve on the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.  Anticholinergic drugs increase heart rate and are used to treat [[bradycardia]].\n\n=== Physical and emotional effects ===\nExcessive activation of the vagal nerve during [[emotional stress]], which is a parasympathetic overcompensation for a strong [[sympathetic nervous system]] response associated with stress, can also cause [[Reflex syncope|vasovagal syncope]] due to a sudden drop in [[cardiac output]], causing [[Brain ischemia|cerebral hypoperfusion]]. Vasovagal syncope affects young children and women more than other groups. It can also lead to temporary [[urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]] under moments of extreme fear.\n\nResearch has shown that women having had complete [[spinal cord injury]] can experience [[orgasm]]s through the vagus nerve, which can go from the [[uterus]] and [[cervix]] to the brain.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | work=Wired | title=Exploring the Mind-Body Orgasm | date=2007-01-10 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919100602/http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | archive-date=19 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Komisaruk BR, Whipple B, Crawford A, Liu WC, Kalnin A, Mosier K | title = Brain activation during vaginocervical self-stimulation and orgasm in women with complete spinal cord injury: fMRI evidence of mediation by the vagus nerves | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1024 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 77\u201388 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15451368 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.07.029 }}</ref>\n\n[[Insulin]] signaling activates the [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the [[arcuate nucleus]], decreases AgRP release, and through the vagus nerve, leads to decreased glucose production by the liver by decreasing gluconeogenic enzymes: [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], [[Glucose 6-phosphatase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pocai A, Lam TK, Gutierrez-Juarez R, Obici S, Schwartz GJ, Bryan J, Aguilar-Bryan L, Rossetti L | title = Hypothalamic K(ATP) channels control hepatic glucose production | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036 | pages = 1026\u201331 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15846348 | doi = 10.1038/nature03439 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagotto U | title = Where does insulin resistance start?

The right vagus then crosses anterior to the right subclavian artery, runs posterior to the [[superior vena cava]], descends posterior to the [[right main bronchus]], and contributes to [[cardiac plexus|cardiac]], [[pulmonary plexus|pulmonary]], and [[esophageal plexus]]es.  It forms the [[posterior vagal trunk]] at the lower part of the esophagus and enters the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] through the [[esophageal hiatus]].\n\nThe left vagus nerve enters the thorax between [[left common carotid artery]] and left subclavian artery and descends on the [[aortic arch]].  It gives rise to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which hooks around the aortic arch to the left of the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] and ascends between the trachea and esophagus.

Vagal and spinal ganglionic nerves mediate the lowering of the [[heart rate]]. The right vagus branch innervates the [[sinoatrial node]]. In healthy people, parasympathetic tone from these sources are well-matched to sympathetic tone. Hyperstimulation of parasympathetic influence promotes [[bradyarrhythmias]]. When hyperstimulated, the left vagal branch predisposes the heart to [[heart block|conduction block]] at the [[atrioventricular node]].\n\nAt this location, neuroscientist [[Otto Loewi]] first demonstrated that nerves secrete substances called [[neurotransmitters]], which have effects on receptors in target tissues. In his experiment, Loewi electrically stimulated the vagus nerve of a frog heart, which slowed the heart. Then he took the fluid from the heart and transferred it to a second frog heart without a vagus nerve. The second heart slowed down without an electrical stimulation. Loewi described the substance released by the vagus nerve as [[vagusstoff]], which was later found to be [[acetylcholine]]. Drugs that inhibit the [[muscarinic receptor]]s ([[anticholinergic]]s) such as [[atropine]] and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], are called vagolytic because they inhibit the action of the vagus nerve on the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.  Anticholinergic drugs increase heart rate and are used to treat [[bradycardia]].\n\n=== Physical and emotional effects ===\nExcessive activation of the vagal nerve during [[emotional stress]], which is a parasympathetic overcompensation for a strong [[sympathetic nervous system]] response associated with stress, can also cause [[Reflex syncope|vasovagal syncope]] due to a sudden drop in [[cardiac output]], causing [[Brain ischemia|cerebral hypoperfusion]]. Vasovagal syncope affects young children and women more than other groups. It can also lead to temporary [[urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]] under moments of extreme fear.\n\nResearch has shown that women having had complete [[spinal cord injury]] can experience [[orgasm]]s through the vagus nerve, which can go from the [[uterus]] and [[cervix]] to the brain.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | work=Wired | title=Exploring the Mind-Body Orgasm | date=2007-01-10 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919100602/http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | archive-date=19 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Komisaruk BR, Whipple B, Crawford A, Liu WC, Kalnin A, Mosier K | title = Brain activation during vaginocervical self-stimulation and orgasm in women with complete spinal cord injury: fMRI evidence of mediation by the vagus nerves | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1024 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 77\u201388 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15451368 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.07.029 }}</ref>\n\n[[Insulin]] signaling activates the [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the [[arcuate nucleus]], decreases AgRP release, and through the vagus nerve, leads to decreased glucose production by the liver by decreasing gluconeogenic enzymes: [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], [[Glucose 6-phosphatase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pocai A, Lam TK, Gutierrez-Juarez R, Obici S, Schwartz GJ, Bryan J, Aguilar-Bryan L, Rossetti L | title = Hypothalamic K(ATP) channels control hepatic glucose production | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036 | pages = 1026\u201331 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15846348 | doi = 10.1038/nature03439 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagotto U | title = Where does insulin resistance start?

Sometimes the right and left branches together are spoken of in the plural and are thus called '''vagi''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|v|e\u026a|d\u0292|a\u026a}} {{respell|VAY|jy}}).  The vagus was also historically called the ''pneumogastric'' nerve since it innervates both the lungs and the stomach.\n\n== Additional illustrations ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Brain human normal inferior view with labels en.svg|Inferior view of the human brain, with the cranial nerves labeled.\nFile:Gray384.png|Section of the neck at about the level of the sixth cervical vertebra\nFile:Gray503.png|Transverse section of thorax, showing relations of pulmonary artery\nFile:Gray505.png|The arch of the aorta, and its branches\nFile:Gray567.png|Dura mater and its processes exposed by removing part of the right half of the skull, and the brain\nFile:Gray622.png|The tracheobronchial lymph glands\nFile:Gray694.png|Section of the medulla oblongata at about the middle of the olive\nFile:Gray719.png|Hind- and mid-brains; postero-lateral view\nFile:Gray792.png|Upper part of medulla spinalis and hind- and mid-brains; posterior aspect, exposed in situ\nFile:Gray838.png|The right sympathetic chain and its connections with the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic plexuses\nFile:Gray848.png|The celiac ganglia with the sympathetic plexuses of the abdominal viscera radiating from the ganglia\nFile:Gray1032.png|The position and relation of the esophagus in the cervical region and in the posterior mediastinum, seen from behind\nFile:Gray1174.png|The thyroid gland and its relations\nFile:Gray1178.png|The thymus of a full-term fetus, exposed in situ\nFile:Slide6rom.JPG|Deep dissection of vagus nerve\nFile:Internal carotid artery.jpg|Vagus nerve \u2013 dissection\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Anatomy-terms}}\n* [[Porphyria]] \u2013 A rare disorder can cause seizures and damage to the vagal nerve.\n* [[Vagovagal reflex]]\n* [[Inflammatory reflex]]\n* [[Polyvagal theory]]\n* [[Vagus ganglion]]\n* [[Vagus nerve stimulation]]\n* [[Vagusstoff]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Nervus vagus}}\n* {{LoyolaMedEd|grossanatomy/h_n/cn/cn1/cn10.htm}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/cnerves/cn10/cn10_1.html|title=10-1|publisher=[[Yale School of Medicine]]|work=Cranial Nerves|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222022/http://www.yale.edu/cnerves/cn10/cn10_1.html|archive-date=2016-03-03}}\n* {{DartmouthHumanAnatomy|figures/chapter_24/24-7.HTM}}\n* {{NormanAnatomy|cranialnerves}} ({{NormanAnatomyFig|X}})\n\n{{Cranial nerves}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vagus Nerve}}\n[[Category:Vagus nerve| ]]\n[[Category:Cranial nerves]]\n[[Category:Autonomic nervous system]]\n[[Category:Thorax (human anatomy)]]\n[[Category:Abdomen]]\n[[Category:Gustatory system]]\n", "name_user": "Captainllama", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSensory neuropathy of Vagus nerve:WL", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"}
