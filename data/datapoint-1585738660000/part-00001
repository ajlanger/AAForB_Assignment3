In January, \"DeParture\" and Warcraft legend \"Moon\", and \"aLive\" moved into the gaming house. They were coached by Hwanni, who also joined Fnatic that month. Later, OZ and Luvsic signed a contract with Fnatic. In 2012, Rain announced his retirement and left the team, followed by Byul, Ares and Moon. Only two players were left in Korea, forcing Fnatic to announce their closure of their gaming house in Seoul and the end of their contracts with aLive and OZ.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alive and OZ leave Fnatic|url=http://www.fnatic.com/content/95362/fnatic-part-ways-with-oz-and-alive|work=Fnatic.com|publisher=inz|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref> Harstem was later promoted from the Academy to the main roster, and the team picked up SaSe, another well known player in the scene.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fnatic adds SaSe|url=http://www.fnatic.com/content/95404/fnatic-welcomes-sase|work=Fnatic.com|publisher=inz|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Other divisions ==\nIn 2008, Fnatic picked up Maximo12, a Spanish ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' football video game player who won several titles in 2008 & 2009, such as the [[World Cyber Games|WCG]] Spain Champion in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maximo12 wins WCG Spain|url=http://www.fnatic.com/content/3873|work=fnatic.com|publisher=WoN|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Fnatic tournament results]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-ach}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]] winner\n | years  = 2011\n | with   =\n | before = Inaugural\n | after  = [[Taipei Assassins]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = European [[League of Legends Championship Series|''League of Legends'' Championship Series]] winner\n | years  = Spring 2013 \u2013 Spring 2014<br>Spring 2015 \u2013 Summer 2015<br>Spring 2018 \u2013\n | with   =\n | before = Inaugural<br>[[Alliance (esports)|Alliance]]<br>[[G2 Esports]]\n | after  = [[Alliance (eSports)|Alliance]]<br>[[G2 Esports]]<br>TBD\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = [[2013 DreamHack Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Championship|DreamHack Winter 2013]] winner\n | years  = 2013\n | with   =\n | before = Inaugural\n | after  = [[EMS One Katowice 2014]]<br>[[Virtus.pro]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = [[ESL One Katowice 2015]] winner\n | years  = 2015\n | with   =\n | before = [[DreamHack Winter 2014]]<br>[[Team LDLC.com]]\n | after  = [[ESL One Cologne 2015]]<br>Fnatic\n}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = [[ESL One Cologne 2015]] winner\n | years  = 2015\n | with   =\n | before = [[ESL One Katowice 2015]]<br>Fnatic\n | after  = [[DreamHack Cluj-Napoca 2015]]<br>[[Team EnVyUs]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{League of Legends Championship Series Europe}}\n{{Professional Counter-Strike competition}}\n{{Professional Heroes of the Storm competition}}\n{{Professional Smite competition}}\n{{Rocket League}}\n\n[[Category:Companies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Counter-Strike teams]]\n[[Category:Defunct and inactive fighting game player sponsors]]\n[[Category:Esports teams based in England]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Storm teams]]\n[[Category:League of Legends European Championship teams]]\n[[Category:Smite teams]]\n[[Category:StarCraft II teams]]\n[[Category:Dota teams]]\n[[Category:Fnatic]]\n[[Category:Quake teams]]\n[[Category:Defunct and inactive Overwatch (video game) teams]]\n[[Category:World of Warcraft teams]]\n[[Category:Defunct and inactive Hearthstone teams]]\n[[Category:Rocket League teams]]\n[[Category:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege teams]]\n", "name_user": "87.2.84.187", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnatic"}
