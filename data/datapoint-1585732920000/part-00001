{"title_page": "List of special elections to the Philippine Congress", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThese are the '''special elections''' (known outside the [[Philippines]] and the United States as \"[[by-election]]s\") to the [[Congress of the Philippines]]. The Philippines holds two types of special elections: those that were supposed to be held on [[Elections in the Philippines|election day]] but were delayed, and those held after an office has become vacant. This article describes the second type.\n\n==Scheduling==\nAs stipulated in [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] (R.A.) No. 6645 approved on December 28, 1987, once a vacancy occurs in the Senate at least 18 months, or in the House of Representatives at least (1) year, before the next scheduled election, the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], upon receipt of a resolution from the chamber where the vacancy occurred, shall schedule a special election. The special election will then be held not earlier than 45 days and not later than 90 days from the date of the resolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno6645.html |title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6645  \u2013 AN ACT PRESCRIBING THE MANNER OF FILING A VACANCY IN THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |date=July 19, 1998 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Republic Act No. 7166 approved on November 26, 1991, amended parts of R.A. No. 6645. When a vacancy in the House of Representatives occurs before one year before the expiration of the term, the special election shall be held not earlier than 60 days and not later than 90 days after occurrence of the vacancy. For the Senate, if the vacancy occurs one year before the expiration of the term, the special election shall be held on the day of the next succeeding regular election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7166_1991.html |title=AN ACT PROVIDING FOR SYNCHRONIZED NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS AND FOR ELECTORAL REFORMS, AUTHORIZING APPROPRIATIONS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES  |publisher=The Lawphil Project |date=November 26, 1991 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>\n, \nWith the passed of Republic Act No. 8295 in 1997, if there is only one candidate running for the position, that candidate would be proclaimed as the winner, and an election would no longer be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=References/RelatedLaws/ElectionLaws/OtherElectionLaws/RA8295 |title=AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE PROCLAMATION OF A LONE CANDIDATE FOR ANY ELECTIVE OFFICE IN A SPECIAL ELECTION, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES |publisher=[[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> This is unlike in regularly scheduled elections where voting would still be held, and the candidate has to get one vote in order to be elected.\n\nNot all vacancies that occurred a year before the next regular election resulted in a special election. To save money, the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] appoints a caretaker representative from a nearby district. In same cases a caretaker representative was appointed while an election date was considered.\n\nAs with general elections, special elections are [[Election day|usually scheduled]] on a Monday. In some cases, election days are declared as holidays.\n\n==House of Representatives==\nSince the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]], there have been two types of elected representatives, those who represent [[single-member districts]] and those elected via the party-list system. When a vacancy occurs for a party-list representative, the next-ranked nominee from the party replaces his predecessor. For district representatives, a special election will be held to determine who shall succeed the predecessor. During the [[Third Philippine Republic]], where representatives had four-year terms, the special election was held together with the mid-term election.\n\nA special election will not be held if the vacancy occurred less than a year before the next regularly scheduled election.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:92%\"\n|-\n![[Legislative districts of the Philippines|District]] !![[Philippine Legislature]]!!

Arroyo appointed [[Teofisto Guingona]] (who was serving his second year as senator) as vice president later that year but prior to the [[2001 Philippine general election|2001 Senate election]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] ruled that instead of twelve, the electorate will vote for thirteen senators, with the thirteenth-placed candidate serving Guingona's unexpired term of three years.

Later that year, [[Marcelo Fernan]] died in office, leaving two vacant seats in the Senate (Fernan's seat was also up in 2001).\n*In [[2004 Philippine presidential election|2004]], senator [[Noli de Castro]] was elected vice president midway through his term . De Castro's seat was up for the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 election]] and no special election was held, nor was the thirteenth-placed candidate during the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Senate election]] ([[Robert Barbers]]) proclaimed winner.\n*In [[2007 Philippine general election|2007]], senator [[Alfredo Lim]] was elected [[mayor of Manila]] midway through his term.

On August 15, 2011, Pimentel assumed the seat of [[Juan Miguel Zubiri]] after allegations of [[electoral fraud]].\n*In [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010]], senator [[Benigno Aquino III]] was elected president midway through his term. Aquino's seat was up for the [[2013 Philippine Senate election|2013 election]] and no special election was held, nor was the thirteenth-placed candidate during the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 Senate election]] ([[Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel]]) proclaimed winner.\nIn all of those cases, the thirteenth-placed candidate was not given the vacant seat as the voters elected for only ''twelve'' senators.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/insights/06/17/10/senate-facts-miriam-coronel-ferrer |title=Senate facts \u2013 Miriam Coronel Ferrer |first=Miriam |last=Coronel Ferrer |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |work=ABS-CBNNews.com}}</ref>\n\nNote that this is not a problem for senators elected prior to 1971, as long as they are elected to a new position prior to the second senate election of their terms (there were two elections for the senate for senators at that time).

To save money, the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] appoints a caretaker representative from a nearby district. In same cases a caretaker representative was appointed while an election date was considered.\n\nAs with general elections, special elections are [[Election day|usually scheduled]] on a Monday.

When a vacancy occurs for a party-list representative, the next-ranked nominee from the party replaces his predecessor. For district representatives, a special election will be held to determine who shall succeed the predecessor. During the [[Third Philippine Republic]], where representatives had four-year terms, the special election was held together with the mid-term election.\n\nA special election will not be held if the vacancy occurred less than a year before the next regularly scheduled election.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:92%\"\n|-\n![[Legislative districts of the Philippines|District]] !![[Philippine Legislature]]!!
