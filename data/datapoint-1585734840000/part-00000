It was part of a mixed-use complex that includes the hotel [[Novotel|Novotel Clarke Quay]] (formerly Hotel New Otani) and Somerset Residences.\n\n==History==\nDeveloped by the Wuthelam Group in collaboration with Daimaru Inc, Liang Court opened in January 1984 as the first major shopping mall along River Valley Road. At that time of opening, it had Japanese department store and supermarket chain Daimaru, lifestyle bookstore Kinokuniya, Taiwanese restaurant Shin Yeh, karaoke chain Party World, consumer electronics chain SAFE Superstore and more than 60 speciality tenants mostly catering to Japanese expatriates. Above Liang Court were two 25-storey tower blocks occupied by Hotel New Otani Singapore and serviced apartment Somerset Liang Court, which opened in November 1984. In 2000, Rainforest Cafe opened in the lower floors but was closed in 2004 due to declining patronage.\n\nIn 2003, Daimaru closed down due to declining sales and restructuring. Its supermarket section was taken over by Meidi-Ya and department store section taken over by electronics chain Audio House and smaller shops. Hotel New Otani's management was taken over by Accor Hotels in December 2004, and was subsequently renamed Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay. The mall changed hands twice, having been sold to Pidemco Land in 1999 and subsequently sold to the Asia Retail Management Fund in 2006.\n\nUnder ARMF management, the mall underwent major refurbishment works in 2007, coupled with a repositioning of its image. The space once taken up by Daimaru was reconfigured into smaller shops, and Audio House was relocated to Level 4. The basement shops were replaced by Japanese restaurants and shops catering to Japanese expatriates. Refurbishment works were completed in 2010.\n\nUniqlo opened at the mall's ground floor in November 2013. In August 2016, Audio House closed down its only mall-based store. Following declining business, the mall was sold to a joint venture between CapitaLand and City Developments Limited in March 2019. Kinokuniya closed its store in April 2019, following the end of its 32-year lease, with various shops and restaurants following suit by the end of that year.\n\n===Redevelopment===\nIn November 2019, CapitaLand and its subsidiary [[The Ascott Limited|Ascott REIT]], along with City Developments Limited announced that Liang Court will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, integrated development featuring two residential towers with 700 condo units, a retail mall, a hotel managed by [[Marriott International]] under the Moxy brand and a 192-unit Somerset serviced residence. The new development is expected to open in phases from 2024, with the Moxy Hotel opening in 2025. All remaining tenants vacated by 31 March, with the majority relocating to the nearby refurbished Great World City. Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay will cease operations from 2 April.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=21 November 2019 | url=https://www.capitaland.com/international/en/about-capitaland/newsroom/news-releases/international/2019/nov/ascott-residence-trust-joins-cdl-capitaLand-consortium-to-redevelop-liang-court-site-with-partial-sale-of-its-gfa-for-sgd-163-3-million.html | title=Ascott Residence Trust joins CDL-CapitaLand Consortium to redevelop Liang Court site | language=en | website=CapitaLand}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of shopping malls in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n\n{{Singapore malls}}\n\n[[Category:1984 establishments in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 disestablishments in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Singapore River]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Defunct Singapore shopping mall}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date = July 2019}}\n{{Use Singapore English|date = July 2019}}\n{{Infobox shopping mall\n| name = Liang Court\n| image = Liang Court 2, Feb 06.JPG\n| caption = Liang Court by the Singapore River, February 2006.\n| location = [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]], [[Singapore]]\n| address = 177 River Valley Road\n| coordinates = {{Coord|1|17|30.1|N|103|50|40.8|E|display=inline,title}}\n| opening_date = {{Start date and age|df=y|1984|1|20}}<ref>The Straits Times, 21 January 1984, Page 25</ref>\n| closing_date = {{End date and age|df=y|2020|3|31}}\n| developer = Wuthelam Group Ltd and Daimaru Inc\n| manager = Capitaland\n| owner = Capitaland and City Developments Ltd\n| number_of_stores = 53\n| number_of_anchors = 3\n| floor_area = {{convert|254631|sqft|m2}}\n| floors = 7\n| website = \n| publictransit = \n}}\n\n'''Liang Court''' ([[Simplified Chinese]]: \u4eae\u9601, [[Traditional Chinese]]: \u4eae\u95a3, Pinyin: ''Li\u00e0ng G\u00e9'') was a [[shopping mall]] located in the vicinity of [[Clarke Quay]], on the [[Singapore River]].
