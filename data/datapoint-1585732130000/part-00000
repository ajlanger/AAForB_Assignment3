Wyner bought a third-acre parcel at the corner of Arlington and Newbury streets and formed a partnership called The Ritz-Arlington Trust with his father, George, and business associate, John S. Slater.\n\nThe trust sold $5.8 million of bonds to finance the construction of an apartment building to be called the Mayflower. The 18-story, {{convert|201|ft|m|adj=on}} brick building, designed by Strickland, Blodget & Law Architects, was far taller than anything else along Newbury Street at the time. Construction had started on the second floor when Wyner was persuaded by then-Mayor [[James Michael Curley]] to make the Mayflower a world-class, 300-room [[Taj Boston|Ritz-Carlton Hotel]], which opened May 19, 1927. Room rates were $5 to $15 per night; $40 per night for suites.\n\nAfter a hugely successful opening, the stock market crash of 1929 and ensuing Depression brought financial difficulties. The Wyner family funded the hotel\u2019s operating losses during the early 1930s, although the interest on the bonds went unpaid. Still in 1933, when only 30 guests were registered in the hotel, Wyner turned on the lights in every guest room to give the appearance that the hotel was full.\n\n===Decline of the first Ritz-Carlton chain===\nThe Philadelphia location was converted to an office building after only a few years in operation. The Atlantic City hotel was sold to Schine Hotels in the late 1940s, and later [[Sheraton Hotels]] in 1959.<ref name=timeline/>  The New York hotel was demolished in 1951, leaving only the Boston location.<ref name=NYarch>{{cite web| title=Ritz-Carlton Hotel| url=http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON036.htm| publisher=New York Architecture| accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref>\n\nEdward Wyner died of a heart attack on December 5, 1961. His six sons tried to continue operation of the Boston hotel, but were unable to overcome difficulties, and decided to sell.\n\n===The Blakeley years: 1964\u20131983===\n[[File:Ritz Carlton in Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|The Ritz-Carlton, [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe unpaid interest on the bonds dissuaded many from trying to buy the hotel. But Cabot, Cabot & Forbes principal Gerald F. Blakeley Jr. was interested. After more than a year of legal work, [[Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr|Hale and Dorr]] succeeded at clearing the bond obligations, and in October 1964 Blakeley and associates Paul Hellmuth and Charles Spaulding acquired the Ritz-Carlton Boston for $5.8 million.\n\n\u201cOut of the 20 years I owned it, it made money three years. The other years it broke even, but from a public relations standpoint for CC&F, it was a tremendous asset,\u201d said Blakeley, who completed a 19-story Ritz-Carlton luxury [[condominium]] complex on land adjacent to the hotel in 1981.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn the late 1960s Blakeley obtained the rights to the Ritz-Carlton name in North America (with the exception of Montreal and New York). In June 1978, Blakeley was awarded the rights and privileges of the Ritz-Carlton trademark in the United States and was given a US Service Mark Registration.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ritz-Carlton name was licensed to the builders of a new hotel in Chicago. [[The Ritz-Carlton Chicago]] opened in 1975 in a tower atop [[Water Tower Place]]. It joined the [[Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts]] chain in 1977, as there was no Ritz-Carlton chain at the time. Confusingly, it remained part of Four Seasons for decades, marketed as \"The Ritz-Carlton Chicago (A Four Seasons Hotel)\". It had no association with the modern Ritz-Carlton chain, though it used the name and the iconic logo. The property was sold in 2013 and left Four Seasons, joining the modern Ritz-Carlton chain as a franchise on August 1, 2015.<ref name=SF>{{cite news| title=Ritz-Carlton Chicago becomes a ...

Unlike [[The Ritz-Carlton, Chicago]] and the [[Ritz-Carlton Montreal]], [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] is not associated with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, instead joining [[The Leading Hotels of the World]].\n\n===The corporate years: 1983\u20131999===\n[[File:Wolfsburg7.jpg|thumb|The Ritz-Carlton at the [[Autostadt]] in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Germany]]: completed in 2000, it was the first hotel of the company to open in Europe.]]\nFrom 1951 to 1975, The Ritz-Carlton Boston had been one of only two Ritz-Carlton hotels in the US. The other was the independently owned [[Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City]] which had since been converted to condominiums. Johnson's company paid the Atlantic City establishment to abandon its name and rename itself The Ritz Condominiums.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nJohnson would later enlarge the company from just the Boston property to 30 hotels worldwide in just 10 years. He obtained financing to do so from Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York in 1983 in the amount of $85 million secured by The Ritz-Carlton Boston. This loan was refinanced in 1989 by Manhattan Tops USA of New York for $136.5 million and again in 1994 by [[The Sumitomo Bank]] of Japan. By 1996, this mortgage was in default and the interest and penalties brought the total debt to $214.8 million.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By splitting this mortgage note into three parts, Sumitomo Bank was able to unbundle The Ritz-Carlton Boston from the trademark rights to the Ritz-Carlton brand worldwide.\n\n[[The Blackstone Group#Real estate|Blackstone Real Estate Acquisitions]] bought The Ritz-Carlton Boston at auction for $75 million in February 1998. A month later, [[Marriott International]] acquired the hotel from Blackstone for $100 million. Marriott International, which franchised and managed over 325,000 rooms, then bought The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. and rights to the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain worldwide from Johnson for $290 million in a two-part transaction completed in 1998.\n\n===Disposal of the historic Boston property===\nIn 1998, Christopher Jeffries, founding partner of Millennium Partners, obtained The Ritz-Carlton franchises from Marriott for four hotel properties under construction: two in Washington, one in [[New York City]], and one in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. In addition, Jeffries was searching for a brand affiliation for the new 155-room hotel and 270-luxury condominiums he was constructing as part of Boston\u2019s {{convert|1800000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Millennium Place, a mixed-use complex on lower Washington Street. Due to noncompetition clauses, the only way he could obtain a second Ritz-Carlton flag in Boston was to own the existing Ritz-Carlton.\n\nMillennium Partners acquired the original Ritz-Carlton Boston for $122 million (though it had sold for just $75 million less than two years prior) and spent $50 million for renovations. Marriott agreed to allow The Ritz-Carlton affiliation for the condominium complex, known as The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton, sharing all of the services of the hotel.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Boston was home to two Ritz-Carlton hotels that faced each other across Boston Common. The Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common opened in 2001.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Taj Hotels]], a subsidiary of the India-based [[Tata Group]], purchased The Ritz-Carlton Boston from its owners, Millennium Partners for $170 million.

Wyner bought a third-acre parcel at the corner of Arlington and Newbury streets and formed a partnership called The Ritz-Arlington Trust with his father, George, and business associate, John S. Slater.\n\nThe trust sold $5.8 million of bonds to finance the construction of an apartment building to be called the Mayflower. The 18-story, {{convert|201|ft|m|adj=on}} brick building, designed by Strickland, Blodget & Law Architects, was far taller than anything else along Newbury Street at the time. Construction had started on the second floor when Wyner was persuaded by then-Mayor [[James Michael Curley]] to make the Mayflower a world-class, 300-room [[Taj Boston|Ritz-Carlton Hotel]], which opened May 19, 1927. Room rates were $5 to $15 per night; $40 per night for suites.\n\nAfter a hugely successful opening, the stock market crash of 1929 and ensuing Depression brought financial difficulties. The Wyner family funded the hotel\u2019s operating losses during the early 1930s, although the interest on the bonds went unpaid. Still in 1933, when only 30 guests were registered in the hotel, Wyner turned on the lights in every guest room to give the appearance that the hotel was full.\n\n===Decline of the first Ritz-Carlton chain===\nThe Philadelphia location was converted to an office building after only a few years in operation. The Atlantic City hotel was sold to Schine Hotels in the late 1940s, and later [[Sheraton Hotels]] in 1959.<ref name=timeline/>  The New York hotel was demolished in 1951, leaving only the Boston location.<ref name=NYarch>{{cite web| title=Ritz-Carlton Hotel| url=http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON036.htm| publisher=New York Architecture| accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref>\n\nEdward Wyner died of a heart attack on December 5, 1961. His six sons tried to continue operation of the Boston hotel, but were unable to overcome difficulties, and decided to sell.\n\n===The Blakeley years: 1964\u20131983===\n[[File:Ritz Carlton in Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|The Ritz-Carlton, [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe unpaid interest on the bonds dissuaded many from trying to buy the hotel. But Cabot, Cabot & Forbes principal Gerald F. Blakeley Jr. was interested. After more than a year of legal work, [[Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr|Hale and Dorr]] succeeded at clearing the bond obligations, and in October 1964 Blakeley and associates Paul Hellmuth and Charles Spaulding acquired the Ritz-Carlton Boston for $5.8 million.\n\n\u201cOut of the 20 years I owned it, it made money three years. The other years it broke even, but from a public relations standpoint for CC&F, it was a tremendous asset,\u201d said Blakeley, who completed a 19-story Ritz-Carlton luxury [[condominium]] complex on land adjacent to the hotel in 1981.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn the late 1960s Blakeley obtained the rights to the Ritz-Carlton name in North America (with the exception of Montreal and New York). In June 1978, Blakeley was awarded the rights and privileges of the Ritz-Carlton trademark in the United States and was given a US Service Mark Registration.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ritz-Carlton name was licensed to the builders of a new hotel in Chicago. [[The Ritz-Carlton Chicago]] opened in 1975 in a tower atop [[Water Tower Place]]. It joined the [[Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts]] chain in 1977, as there was no Ritz-Carlton chain at the time. Confusingly, it remained part of Four Seasons for decades, marketed as \"The Ritz-Carlton Chicago (A Four Seasons Hotel)\". It had no association with the modern Ritz-Carlton chain, though it used the name and the iconic logo. The property was sold in 2013 and left Four Seasons, joining the modern Ritz-Carlton chain as a franchise on August 1, 2015.<ref name=SF>{{cite news| title=Ritz-Carlton Chicago becomes a ...

Unlike [[The Ritz-Carlton, Chicago]] and the [[Ritz-Carlton Montreal]], [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] is not associated with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, instead joining [[The Leading Hotels of the World]].\n\n===The corporate years: 1983\u20131999===\n[[File:Wolfsburg7.jpg|thumb|The Ritz-Carlton at the [[Autostadt]] in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Germany]]: completed in 2000, it was the first hotel of the company to open in Europe.]]\nFrom 1951 to 1975, The Ritz-Carlton Boston had been one of only two Ritz-Carlton hotels in the US. The other was the independently owned [[Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City]] which had since been converted to condominiums. Johnson's company paid the Atlantic City establishment to abandon its name and rename itself The Ritz Condominiums.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nJohnson would later enlarge the company from just the Boston property to 30 hotels worldwide in just 10 years. He obtained financing to do so from Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York in 1983 in the amount of $85 million secured by The Ritz-Carlton Boston. This loan was refinanced in 1989 by Manhattan Tops USA of New York for $136.5 million and again in 1994 by [[The Sumitomo Bank]] of Japan. By 1996, this mortgage was in default and the interest and penalties brought the total debt to $214.8 million.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By splitting this mortgage note into three parts, Sumitomo Bank was able to unbundle The Ritz-Carlton Boston from the trademark rights to the Ritz-Carlton brand worldwide.\n\n[[The Blackstone Group#Real estate|Blackstone Real Estate Acquisitions]] bought The Ritz-Carlton Boston at auction for $75 million in February 1998. A month later, [[Marriott International]] acquired the hotel from Blackstone for $100 million. Marriott International, which franchised and managed over 325,000 rooms, then bought The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. and rights to the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain worldwide from Johnson for $290 million in a two-part transaction completed in 1998.\n\n===Disposal of the historic Boston property===\nIn 1998, Christopher Jeffries, founding partner of Millennium Partners, obtained The Ritz-Carlton franchises from Marriott for four hotel properties under construction: two in Washington, one in [[New York City]], and one in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. In addition, Jeffries was searching for a brand affiliation for the new 155-room hotel and 270-luxury condominiums he was constructing as part of Boston\u2019s {{convert|1800000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Millennium Place, a mixed-use complex on lower Washington Street. Due to noncompetition clauses, the only way he could obtain a second Ritz-Carlton flag in Boston was to own the existing Ritz-Carlton.\n\nMillennium Partners acquired the original Ritz-Carlton Boston for $122 million (though it had sold for just $75 million less than two years prior) and spent $50 million for renovations. Marriott agreed to allow The Ritz-Carlton affiliation for the condominium complex, known as The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton, sharing all of the services of the hotel.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Boston was home to two Ritz-Carlton hotels that faced each other across Boston Common. The Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common opened in 2001.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Taj Hotels]], a subsidiary of the India-based [[Tata Group]], purchased The Ritz-Carlton Boston from its owners, Millennium Partners for $170 million.
