When occurring within spoken Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of [[sandhi]] in [[Sanskrit grammar]], however with the additional peculiarity that after preceding ''a'' or ''\u0101'', the ''au'' of ''aum''  does not form [[vriddhi]] (''au'') but [[guna]] (''o'') per [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] 6.1.95 (i.e. 'om').\n\nIt is sometimes also written \u0913\u0969\u092e\u094d (''\u014d\u0304m'' {{IPA-sa|o\u02d0\u02d0m|}}), notably by [[Arya Samaj]], where \u0969 (i.e., the digit \"3\") is ''[[Pluti|pluta]]'' (\"three times as long\"), [[pluti|indicating a length]] of three [[morae]] (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) \u2014 an [[vowel length|overlong]] [[nasalised]] [[close-mid back rounded vowel]].\n\nThe ''Om'' symbol [[File:Aum.svg|20px]]  is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in [[Devanagari]], combining \u0913 (''{{IAST|au}}'') and [[chandrabindu]] ([[\u0901]], ''{{IAST|\u1e43}}''). In [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} (\"generic symbol independent of Devanagari font\").\n\nThe ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.<ref>Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA490 p. 490].</ref>\n[[N\u0101gar\u012b script|Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to represent ''AUM'' as a symbol of the entirety of \"consciousness, universe\" and \"the message that God is within a person and without\".<ref>Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.</ref>\n\nThe ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.

In [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} (\"generic symbol independent of Devanagari font\").\n\nThe ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.<ref>Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA490 p. 490].</ref>\n[[N\u0101gar\u012b script|Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to represent ''AUM'' as a symbol of the entirety of \"consciousness, universe\" and \"the message that God is within a person and without\".<ref>Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.</ref>\n\nThe ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.
