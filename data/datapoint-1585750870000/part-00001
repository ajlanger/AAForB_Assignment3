In 1857, he resigned as MP for Buckinghamshire and did not stand for re-election due to the deteriorating family fortunes and his father's bankruptcy. \n\nIn 1859, Lord Chandos contested against [[William Ewart Gladstone]] for the constituency of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], but lost by 859 to 1,050 votes. In 1861, he succeeded his father as [[Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] (and in various other titles across four [[Peerages]]) and took his seat in the [[House of Lords]]; he also resigned as chairman of the London and North-Western Railway. In the 1860s he was chairman of the [[London Pneumatic Despatch Company]].\n\nBuckingham's political career was stagnant until 1866, when he was appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and became Lord Derby's [[Lord President of the Council]]. During the interregnum, Buckingham served as chairman of the executive committee of the royal commission for the Great Exhibition of 1862. He served as Lord President of the Council until 8 March 1867, when he succeeded [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]] as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].\n\n== As Secretary of State for the Colonies ==\n\nBuckingham was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies when [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]] resigned in March 1867 over the Reform Bill and served from 8 March 1867 to 1 December 1868. During this period, he was also appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire]]. As Secretary of State for the Colonies. Buckingham had to deal with the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]. He also attracted controversy over his dispute with [[John Colenso|Bishop Colenso]] of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]]. Buckingham's tenure ended in December 1868 when the Conservative Party ministry of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] resigned. He was succeeded as Colonial Secretary by [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]].<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nOn 21 July 1868, the House of Lords recognised him as the 10th [[Lord Kinloss]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]], which had been dormant since the death of the 6th Lord Kinloss, his three-times great-grandfather [[Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury|Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin]], in 1747. Through the House of Lords ruling, Buckingham's father was recognised posthumously as ''[[de jure]]'' 9th Lord Kinloss, his maternal grandmother Lady Anna Brydges as ''de jure'' 8th Lady Kinloss, and his great-grandfather [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]] as ''de jure'' 7th Lord Kinloss. Though the lordship was the most minor of Buckingham's many titles, it was the only one that could be inherited by his daughters, and he established his right to it at a time when the likelihood emerged that he would leave no male heir.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite book| title=[[Burke's Peerage|Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knighthood]]| publisher=Burke's Peerage & Gentry| editor-last=Mosley| editor-first=Charles| editorlink=Charles Mosley (genealogist)| edition=107| year=2003| pages=2185-2186| ref=Burke| isbn=0-9711966-2-1}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of Madras==\n\n[[File:Detail from the painting of the Maharaja of Travancore welcoming 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, Trivandrum 1880, painted by Raja Ravi Varma.png|thumb|Detail from the painting of ''the Maharaja of Travancore welcoming Buckingham and Chandos, Trivandrum 1880'', painted by Raja Ravi Varma.]]\n\n[[File:Raja ravivarma painting 50 historic meeting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] depicting Buckingham being greeted by [[Visakham Thirunal]], with [[Ayilyam Thirunal of Travancore]] looking on, during Buckingham's visit to [[Trivandrum]], [[Travancore]] in early 1880.]]\n\n[[File:Detail from the painting of the Maharaja of Travancore and his brother welcoming 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (1823-1889), Trivandrum 1880, painted by Raja Ravi Varma.png|thumb|Detail from the painting of the ''Maharaja of Travancore and his brother welcoming Buckingham and Chandos to Trivandrum in 1880'', painted by Raja Ravi Varma, 1881.]]\n\nWhen the Conservative Party was re-elected to power in the United Kingdom in 1874 and Disraeli became the Prime Minister once again, Buckingham was appointed Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], British India.

In 1876, the [[Great Famine of 1876\u201378]] broke out in [[Madras Presidency]].

Though the famine eventually came to an end in 1878, the issue had far-reaching effects.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nAs a part of the famine relief work, Buckingham had commenced the construction of a navigation channel between Madras city and the northern part of the Madras Presidency so that transportation of supplies to the interior in cases of emergency would be easy. More than 715,000 people were employed as labourers in Madras to assist with the relief work. Opened in 1878, this canal was named after Buckingham as [[Buckingham Canal]].<ref name=\"times\"/> Buckingham Street in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] was also named after him by the [[Tamils|Tamil]] labourers who were brought there during the British colonial period. \n\nDispleasure of the tribes of the northern part of the Presidency over the stringent taxation schemes of the British government erupted in the form of the [[Rampa Rebellion of 1879|a major rebellion]] in 1879. The rebellion was eventually suppressed through a joint operation of the Madras police and army and the Hyderabad army and the captured prisoners sent to the Andamans. Many of the stringent taxation laws were repealed.\n\nOn 30 August 1880, [[William Patrick Adam]] was appointed Governor of Madras<ref name=\"nytimes18800831\">{{cite news| title=Current Foreign Topics| newspaper=The New York Times| date=31 August 1880| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/09/01/98625728.pdf}}</ref> and he succeeded Buckingham in December 1880.\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn May 1886, Buckingham succeeded [[John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] as Chairman of Committees in the [[House of Lords]]. He made few speeches in the House of Lords and succeeded in paying off most of his father's debts. Gradually, towards the later part of his life his financial situation improved and by 1883, he owned 10,482 acres of land with a total value of \u00a318,080.\n\nBuckingham died in March 1889, aged 65, from [[diabetes]] at [[Chandos House]], London. His illness was unexpected and not originally thought to be serious; the House of Lords postponed voting on several bills until he recovered. Within a week, however, his illness proved fatal, despite the efforts of Dr. Henry Walter Kiallmark, the family physician, and Sir [[James Paget]], who was called in to assist.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nThe duke was buried at the family vault in the church at [[Wotton House]], Buckinghamshire.<ref name=\"funeral\"/>\n\nWith no male issue, the dukedom and marquessate of Buckingham and Chandos and the Earldom of Temple became extinct.

He joined the [[British Army]], eventually rising to become a [[Colonel (British Army)|colonel]]. Buckingham entered politics, as Lord Chandos, in 1846 when he was elected unopposed from [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] as a candidate of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Buckingham served as Member of Parliament from 1846 to 1857, when he resigned. He contested a re-election in 1859, but lost.

In 1861, he succeeded his father as [[Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] (and in various other titles across four [[Peerages]]) and took his seat in the [[House of Lords]]; he also resigned as chairman of the London and North-Western Railway. In the 1860s he was chairman of the [[London Pneumatic Despatch Company]].\n\nBuckingham's political career was stagnant until 1866, when he was appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and became Lord Derby's [[Lord President of the Council]]. During the interregnum, Buckingham served as chairman of the executive committee of the royal commission for the Great Exhibition of 1862.

During this period, he was also appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire]]. As Secretary of State for the Colonies. Buckingham had to deal with the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]. He also attracted controversy over his dispute with [[John Colenso|Bishop Colenso]] of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]]. Buckingham's tenure ended in December 1868 when the Conservative Party ministry of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] resigned. He was succeeded as Colonial Secretary by [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]].<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nOn 21 July 1868, the House of Lords recognised him as the 10th [[Lord Kinloss]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]], which had been dormant since the death of the 6th Lord Kinloss, his three-times great-grandfather [[Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury|Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin]], in 1747. Through the House of Lords ruling, Buckingham's father was recognised posthumously as ''[[de jure]]'' 9th Lord Kinloss, his maternal grandmother Lady Anna Brydges as ''de jure'' 8th Lady Kinloss, and his great-grandfather [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]] as ''de jure'' 7th Lord Kinloss. Though the lordship was the most minor of Buckingham's many titles, it was the only one that could be inherited by his daughters, and he established his right to it at a time when the likelihood emerged that he would leave no male heir.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite book| title=[[Burke's Peerage|Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knighthood]]| publisher=Burke's Peerage & Gentry| editor-last=Mosley| editor-first=Charles| editorlink=Charles Mosley (genealogist)| edition=107| year=2003| pages=2185-2186| ref=Burke| isbn=0-9711966-2-1}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of Madras==\n\n[[File:Detail from the painting of the Maharaja of Travancore welcoming 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, Trivandrum 1880, painted by Raja Ravi Varma.png|thumb|Detail from the painting of ''the Maharaja of Travancore welcoming Buckingham and Chandos, Trivandrum 1880'', painted by Raja Ravi Varma.]]\n\n[[File:Raja ravivarma painting 50 historic meeting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] depicting Buckingham being greeted by [[Visakham Thirunal]], with [[Ayilyam Thirunal of Travancore]] looking on, during Buckingham's visit to [[Trivandrum]], [[Travancore]] in early 1880.]]\n\n[[File:Detail from the painting of the Maharaja of Travancore and his brother welcoming 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (1823-1889), Trivandrum 1880, painted by Raja Ravi Varma.png|thumb|Detail from the painting of the ''Maharaja of Travancore and his brother welcoming Buckingham and Chandos to Trivandrum in 1880'', painted by Raja Ravi Varma, 1881.]]\n\nWhen the Conservative Party was re-elected to power in the United Kingdom in 1874 and Disraeli became the Prime Minister once again, Buckingham was appointed Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], British India.

In 1876, the [[Great Famine of 1876\u201378]] broke out in [[Madras Presidency]].

Though the famine eventually came to an end in 1878, the issue had far-reaching effects.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nAs a part of the famine relief work, Buckingham had commenced the construction of a navigation channel between Madras city and the northern part of the Madras Presidency so that transportation of supplies to the interior in cases of emergency would be easy. More than 715,000 people were employed as labourers in Madras to assist with the relief work. Opened in 1878, this canal was named after Buckingham as [[Buckingham Canal]].<ref name=\"times\"/> Buckingham Street in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] was also named after him by the [[Tamils|Tamil]] labourers who were brought there during the British colonial period. \n\nDispleasure of the tribes of the northern part of the Presidency over the stringent taxation schemes of the British government erupted in the form of the [[Rampa Rebellion of 1879|a major rebellion]] in 1879. The rebellion was eventually suppressed through a joint operation of the Madras police and army and the Hyderabad army and the captured prisoners sent to the Andamans. Many of the stringent taxation laws were repealed.\n\nOn 30 August 1880, [[William Patrick Adam]] was appointed Governor of Madras<ref name=\"nytimes18800831\">{{cite news| title=Current Foreign Topics| newspaper=The New York Times| date=31 August 1880| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/09/01/98625728.pdf}}</ref> and he succeeded Buckingham in December 1880.\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn May 1886, Buckingham succeeded [[John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] as Chairman of Committees in the [[House of Lords]]. He made few speeches in the House of Lords and succeeded in paying off most of his father's debts. Gradually, towards the later part of his life his financial situation improved and by 1883, he owned 10,482 acres of land with a total value of \u00a318,080.\n\nBuckingham died in March 1889, aged 65, from [[diabetes]] at [[Chandos House]], London. His illness was unexpected and not originally thought to be serious; the House of Lords postponed voting on several bills until he recovered. Within a week, however, his illness proved fatal, despite the efforts of Dr. Henry Walter Kiallmark, the family physician, and Sir [[James Paget]], who was called in to assist.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nThe duke was buried at the family vault in the church at [[Wotton House]], Buckinghamshire.<ref name=\"funeral\"/>\n\nWith no male issue, the dukedom and marquessate of Buckingham and Chandos and the Earldom of Temple became extinct.
