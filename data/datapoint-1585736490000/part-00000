Schofield]], who made his own modifications to the Model 3 to meet his perceptions of the Cavalry's needs. Smith & Wesson incorporated these modifications into an 1875 design they named after the Major, planning to obtain significant military contracts for the new revolver.<ref name=boorman/>\n\nThe S&W Model 3 was originally chambered for the [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44 Russian]] cartridges, and typically did not have the cartridge information stamped on the gun (as is standard practice for most commercial firearms). Model 3 revolvers were later produced in an assortment of calibers, including [[.44 Henry]] Rimfire, [[.44-40]], .32-44, .38-44, and [[.45 Schofield]]. The design would influence the smaller [[S&W .38 Single Action]] that is retroactively referred to as the Model 2.<ref name=boorman/>\n\n==Russian Model==\n[[File:George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch.jpeg|thumb|George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch after the Duke Buffalo Hunt; the Duke with his new Smith & Wesson No. 3 in the holster]]\n[[File:S&W Auswerfer.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, open for loading.

The first was the 1st Model Russian (the original order design), with the Russian Ordnance Inspector mandating a number of improvements to the design, resulting in the 2nd Model Russian, with a final revision to the Russian design being known as the 3rd Model Russian.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\">{{cite book|last1=Supica|first1=Jim|last2=Nahas|first2=Richard|title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson|date=3 January 2007|publisher=F+W Media |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-293-X|pages=88\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nSmith & Wesson nearly went bankrupt as a result of their Russian contract production, as the imperial government assigned a number of engineers and gunsmiths to [[reverse-engineer]] the Smith & Wesson design, and then began to produce copies of the revolver\u2014both in their own arsenal at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and by contracting other manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to manufacture copies of the revolver (a common practice at the time\u2014Webley & Scott's [[British Bulldog revolver]] was widely copied, too, by European and American gunsmiths).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Russian and European copies of the S&W Model 3 revolver were generally of very high quality, but considerably cheaper than the S&W produced revolvers. This led to the imperial government cancelling the order for significant quantities of Smith & Wesson\u2013made revolvers (which Smith & Wesson had already produced), and delaying (or refusing) payment for the handguns that had already been delivered.<ref name=S&W>Lawman, Tuolumne [http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm \"Smith & Wesson's #3, Colt's Biggest Rival in the Old West\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228033351/http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}. Sam Hane's Western History.</ref>\n\n==Schofield Revolver==\nThe U.S. Army adopted the [[.44 S&W American]] caliber Smith & Wesson Model 3 revolver in 1870, making the Model 3 revolver the first standard-issue cartridge-firing revolver in US service. Most military pistols until that point were [[Gunpowder|black powder]] cap and ball revolvers, which were (by comparison) slow, complicated, and susceptible to the effects of wet weather.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n[[File:S&W Schofield Model.jpg|thumb|S&W Schofield]]\nIn 1875, the US Ordnance Board granted Smith & Wesson a contract to outfit the military with Model 3 revolvers incorporating the design improvements of Major George W. Schofield (known as the \"Schofield revolver\"), providing that they could make the revolvers fire the .45 [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] (AKA \"[[.45 Long Colt]]\") ammunition already in use by the US military. Smith & Wesson instead developed their own, slightly shorter .45 caliber round, the [[.45 Schofield]], otherwise known as the .45 S&W.<ref name=\"Kinard2004\">{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA129|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|pages=129\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became obvious in the field that the two cartridges would not work interchangeably in the Schofield (although they both worked in the Colt), the U.S. Government adopted the shorter .45 Schofield cartridge as the standard cartridge. Despite the change, old stocks of the longer .45 Colt rounds in the supply line caused the Army to drop most of the Schofields and continue with the Colt. Major Schofield had patented his locking system and earned a payment on each gun that Smith & Wesson sold, and at the time his older brother, [[John M. Schofield]], was the head of the Army Ordnance Board and the political situation may have been the main issue for the early end of army sales.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nMany of the S&W Model 3 Schofield revolvers saw service in the [[Indian Wars]], and there are reports of them in use as late as the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Like the other Smith & Wesson Model 3s, they were also reportedly popular with lawmen and outlaws in the American West, and were reportedly used by [[Jesse James]], [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Bob Ford]] (who used one to kill James),<ref name=\"Agnew2012\">{{cite book|last=Agnew|first=Jeremy|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&pg=PA150|date=1 November 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1|page=150}}</ref> [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Pat Garrett]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Virgil Earp]], [[Billy the Kid]], and many others. The Smith & Wesson No. 3 revolver was famously used by [[Wyatt Earp]] during the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|OK Corral Gunfight]] with the [[Ike Clanton|Clanton Gang]].<ref name=boorman/>\n\nWhile the standard barrel length was 7\", many Schofields were purchased as surplus by distributors, and had the barrels shortened to 5\", and were refinished in nickel.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/> After the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, the US Army sold off all their surplus Schofield revolvers. The surplus Schofield revolvers were reconditioned by wholesalers and gunsmiths (at professional factory-quality level) with a considerable number offered for sale on the commercial market with a 5-inch barrel as well as the standard size barrel of 7 inches.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nOf the most notable purchasers of these reconditioned model 3 Schofield revolvers was [[Wells Fargo and Company]], who purchased the revolvers for use by Wells Fargo Road Agents and had the barrels shortened to a more concealable 5 inches length. These revolvers were then inspected by the Wells Fargo armorer and uniquely stamped \"W.F. & Co\" or \"Wells Fargo & Co\", along with the original Smith & Wesson serial number re-stamped alongside the Wells Fargo stamping on the flat part of the barrel just forward of the barrel pivot as well as re-stamping any part of each revolver which had not originally been stamped or stamped in a location that would be difficult to view the serial number, when needed.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Wells Fargo Schofield revolvers became so popular with collectors from the 1970s onwards that the unique Wells Fargo markings were being \"counterfeited\" or \"faked\" by unscrupulous sellers to enhance the value of other similar versions that had not been genuinely owned by Wells Fargo & Co.  There are more \"fake\" Wells Fargo marked Schofield revolvers than genuine ones in existence and, accordingly, a collector interested in purchasing a \"Wells Fargo\" Schofield revolver would be well advised to have a pre-purchase inspection and verification performed by an expert who specializes in this model.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nLieutenant Colonel Schofield shot himself on December 17, 1882, with a S&W Schofield revolver after suffering a bout of mental illness, stress and isolation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Springfield Armory Museum|title=REVOLVER -  SMITH & WESSON REVOLVER MODEL 3 SCHOFIELD FIRST MODEL SINGLE ACTION .45 SN# 1532|url= http://ww2.rediscov.com/spring/VFPCGI.exe?IDCFile=/spring/DETAILS.IDC,SPECIFIC=9823,DATABASE=objects}}</ref>\n\nAn engraved, gold-plated New Model Number 3 with pearl grips was presented to sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]] in the 1890s by her husband Frank Butler.

In the previous engineering, the posts of the frame would wear out after heavy usage.  Schofield's improvement called for heat treated, replaceable components at this sensitive \"wear\" area of the catch and latch. The serial number range also will give an indication of whether it is First or Second Model, with the serial numbers changing from the First Model to the Second Model at a little over 3,000.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====New Model Number 3====\n[[File:S & W 3rd New Model.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, New Model, 44 Russian]]\nIn 1877, S&W discontinued production of its other Model 3s such as the American, Russian, and Schofield\u2014in favor a new improved design called the New Model Number Three. This new model has a longer cylinder allowing it to fire longer cartridges. Standard chambering was .44 Russian, although other calibers were offered on special order or in related models such as the .44-40 Frontier Model, the .32-44 & .38-44 Target Models, and the very rare .38-40 Winchester Model.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====Australian Model====\nIn 1880 the [[South Australia Police]], who were then interested in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted a display of New Model Number Three revolvers at the [[Australian Exposition]] in [[Melbourne]].  At the direction of [[William John Peterswald|Police Commissioner Peterswald]] an order was placed through S&W's New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in [[.44 Russian]] with a seven-inch barrel length. The order, which included extension shoulder stocks, ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at [[Adelaide]] in March 1882.  The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government [[Broad arrow#Use in Australia|broad arrow punch mark]], and were called [[revolver-carbines]].  They were issued to [[mounted police]], known as troopers, who at that period also policed the [[Northern Territory]].  Both the South Australia and [[Western Australia]] police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow.  For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T.  Nearly all serial numbers are known, and are listed in the book ''Service Arms of the South Australian Police''.<ref>''Service Arms of the South Australian Police : 1838 to 1988, the first 150 years'' by Max Slee : (Antique & Historical Arms Assoc., of South Australia, Adelaide, 1988) {{ISBN|0-7316-4078-0}}:</ref> The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of [[Los Angeles]].\n\n====Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action First Model====\n[[File:S&W 44 DA Frontier.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier]]\n\nThe Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier Revolver was made from 1881 to 1898. This revolver could be fired in both single- and [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double action]], and used the typical S&W top-break ejection system. Chambered primarily in [[.44 Russian]], as well as [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44-40]] it incorporated the company's familiar curved grip frame, with hard rubber or checkered walnut grips. It was available in blue and nickel-plated finishes, with 4, 5, 6, 6\u00bd and 8 inch barrels (the 5\" being the most common).\n<ref>https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2013/4/23/smith-wesson-44-double-action-first-model/</ref>\n\n==Copies==\nThe popular Model 3 was copied in many countries. Most common were the versions made in Spain, Mexico and Belgium; but companies such as [[Ludwig Loewe & Company]] of Germany and the [[Tula Arsenal]] in Russia played a hand in the counterfeit game, too. Copies have been found in Turkey and Pakistan as well, made by local manufacturers.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===11mm Orbea Hermanos y Cia. M1884 ''Sistema ON\u00c1'' (\"S&W Model 7\")===\n[[File:Rev\u00f3lver Orbea.jpg|thumb|An Orbea Hermanos revolver at the Seville Military History Museum.]]\n\nIn 1884 the Spanish government made a decree stating that any invention not copyrighted by their copyright office was not under their protection. One victim of this was Smith & Wesson, whose lucrative contract to produce Model 3 revolvers for the Spanish Army was quickly cancelled. Its work given to local gunsmiths in Eibar by different firms without any standardization of parts.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe [[Orbea|Orbea Hermanos]] ''Modelo 1884 Sistema ON\u00c1'' ([[Basque language|Basque]] ''on\u00e1'' > \"good\") or \"S&W Model 7\" revolver was made from 1884 until the 1920s. It is notable for its grip medallion, which is an \"OH\" interlaced like the Smith & Wesson \"S&W\".<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nAn interesting footnote is that Smith & Wesson immediately copyrighted all of their other designs in Spain from then on. That is why their firearms have MARCA REGISTRADA and the date of the Spanish patent on their barrels.<ref name=\"Lee2016\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=2016 Standard Catalog of Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide|date=29 January 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-1-4402-4441-4|page=1034}}</ref>\n\n===Liege copies===\nThere were a number of unauthorized Belgian copies made in [[.44 Russian]] and [[.44-40 Winchester]] as Single and Double Action revolvers. These copies, mostly manufactured in Liege, were marked as if to deceive a buyer into thinking that they were a revolver produced by Smith & Wesson. Many of the finer details such as the location of the Smith & Wesson factory were incorrectly stamped on the revolvers (\"New York\" and \"VK\" being the two most common).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nSmith & Wesson brought lawsuits against two gunmakers in Liege, which they originally lost, but won on appeal.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===Users===\n====Italy====\nThe prime contractor for the Italian military was Orbea, which chambered their revolvers for the Italian [[:it:10,35 x 20 mm|10.4mm cartridge]].  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I, and according to online sources were the preferred handgun of elite [[Arditi]] troops.\n\n====Philippines====\nMany Spanish firearms were captured by the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Liberation Army]] during the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]], among them Model 1884 revolvers. Some were brought by defectors from the Spanish military.  These handguns also saw service, later, in the [[Philippine-American War]].\n\n====Romania====\nRevolvers for the Romanian military were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, and were made by Trocaola, Aranzabal y C\u00eda.  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I.\n\n====Spain====\nSpain used these revolvers, which were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, during the Philippine Revolution, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the [[Rif War]], and the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe ''M1884'' was later briefly made chambered in .455 Webley for British government contracts in 1915 and 1916. It was designated by the British Army as the \"Pistol, Old Pattern\", due to its old design. They were dubbed \"Spanish Webleys\" by troops even though they were copies of the S&W Model 3. Orbea Hermanos y Cia., [[:es:G.A.C.|Garate, Anitua y Cia.]], and Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. were contracted to make 30,000 revolvers among them. Orbea Hermanos was the major contractor and the other two were sub-contractors. Rexach & Urgoite was later contracted in 1916 to make 500 pistols but all failed proofing and the lot was refused.\n\nFinish and quality control was varied throughout the run of production. The fact that they were making service pistols and revolvers for France and Italy at the same time was definitely a factor.\n\nAs there was no standardization of design or parts between manufacturers, each manufacturer's model was considered a different gun altogether. The Garate, Anitua y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.1 Mk.I'',<ref>Taylerson-Chamberlain, W. H. J. and A. W. F. ''Revolvers of the British Services, 1854-1944'', pp. 57-59.</ref><ref>Maze, Robert J. ''Howdah to High Power \u2013 A Century of British Breechloading Service Pistols (1867-1967)'', pp. 93-94</ref> the Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.I'', and the Orbea Hermanos model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.3 Mk.I''.\n\nThe weapons were given to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] after the war. The RUC later sold them off to the [[New South Wales Police Force]], who made snub-nosed revolvers out of them and issued them as backup pistols. A cut-down snub-nosed .455 \"Old Pattern\" Revolver was carried by one of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]' bodyguards.\n\n==Modern reproductions==\nModern reproductions of the Smith & Wesson model 3 Revolver are made by a number of companies, including (most notably) Smith & Wesson themselves, as well as the Italian arms-makers [[A.

Smith & Wesson incorporated these modifications into an 1875 design they named after the Major, planning to obtain significant military contracts for the new revolver.<ref name=boorman/>\n\nThe S&W Model 3 was originally chambered for the [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44 Russian]] cartridges, and typically did not have the cartridge information stamped on the gun (as is standard practice for most commercial firearms). Model 3 revolvers were later produced in an assortment of calibers, including [[.44 Henry]] Rimfire, [[.44-40]], .32-44, .38-44, and [[.45 Schofield]]. The design would influence the smaller [[S&W .38 Single Action]] that is retroactively referred to as the Model 2.<ref name=boorman/>\n\n==Russian Model==\n[[File:George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch.jpeg|thumb|George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch after the Duke Buffalo Hunt; the Duke with his new Smith & Wesson No. 3 in the holster]]\n[[File:S&W Auswerfer.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, open for loading.

The first was the 1st Model Russian (the original order design), with the Russian Ordnance Inspector mandating a number of improvements to the design, resulting in the 2nd Model Russian, with a final revision to the Russian design being known as the 3rd Model Russian.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\">{{cite book|last1=Supica|first1=Jim|last2=Nahas|first2=Richard|title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson|date=3 January 2007|publisher=F+W Media |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-293-X|pages=88\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nSmith & Wesson nearly went bankrupt as a result of their Russian contract production, as the imperial government assigned a number of engineers and gunsmiths to [[reverse-engineer]] the Smith & Wesson design, and then began to produce copies of the revolver\u2014both in their own arsenal at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and by contracting other manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to manufacture copies of the revolver (a common practice at the time\u2014Webley & Scott's [[British Bulldog revolver]] was widely copied, too, by European and American gunsmiths).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Russian and European copies of the S&W Model 3 revolver were generally of very high quality, but considerably cheaper than the S&W produced revolvers. This led to the imperial government cancelling the order for significant quantities of Smith & Wesson\u2013made revolvers (which Smith & Wesson had already produced), and delaying (or refusing) payment for the handguns that had already been delivered.<ref name=S&W>Lawman, Tuolumne [http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm \"Smith & Wesson's #3, Colt's Biggest Rival in the Old West\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228033351/http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}. Sam Hane's Western History.</ref>\n\n==Schofield Revolver==\nThe U.S. Army adopted the [[.44 S&W American]] caliber Smith & Wesson Model 3 revolver in 1870, making the Model 3 revolver the first standard-issue cartridge-firing revolver in US service. Most military pistols until that point were [[Gunpowder|black powder]] cap and ball revolvers, which were (by comparison) slow, complicated, and susceptible to the effects of wet weather.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n[[File:S&W Schofield Model.jpg|thumb|S&W Schofield]]\nIn 1875, the US Ordnance Board granted Smith & Wesson a contract to outfit the military with Model 3 revolvers incorporating the design improvements of Major George W. Schofield (known as the \"Schofield revolver\"), providing that they could make the revolvers fire the .45 [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] (AKA \"[[.45 Long Colt]]\") ammunition already in use by the US military. Smith & Wesson instead developed their own, slightly shorter .45 caliber round, the [[.45 Schofield]], otherwise known as the .45 S&W.<ref name=\"Kinard2004\">{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA129|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|pages=129\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became obvious in the field that the two cartridges would not work interchangeably in the Schofield (although they both worked in the Colt), the U.S. Government adopted the shorter .45 Schofield cartridge as the standard cartridge. Despite the change, old stocks of the longer .45 Colt rounds in the supply line caused the Army to drop most of the Schofields and continue with the Colt. Major Schofield had patented his locking system and earned a payment on each gun that Smith & Wesson sold, and at the time his older brother, [[John M. Schofield]], was the head of the Army Ordnance Board and the political situation may have been the main issue for the early end of army sales.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nMany of the S&W Model 3 Schofield revolvers saw service in the [[Indian Wars]], and there are reports of them in use as late as the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Like the other Smith & Wesson Model 3s, they were also reportedly popular with lawmen and outlaws in the American West, and were reportedly used by [[Jesse James]], [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Bob Ford]] (who used one to kill James),<ref name=\"Agnew2012\">{{cite book|last=Agnew|first=Jeremy|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&pg=PA150|date=1 November 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1|page=150}}</ref> [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Pat Garrett]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Virgil Earp]], [[Billy the Kid]], and many others. The Smith & Wesson No. 3 revolver was famously used by [[Wyatt Earp]] during the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|OK Corral Gunfight]] with the [[Ike Clanton|Clanton Gang]].<ref name=boorman/>\n\nWhile the standard barrel length was 7\", many Schofields were purchased as surplus by distributors, and had the barrels shortened to 5\", and were refinished in nickel.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/> After the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, the US Army sold off all their surplus Schofield revolvers. The surplus Schofield revolvers were reconditioned by wholesalers and gunsmiths (at professional factory-quality level) with a considerable number offered for sale on the commercial market with a 5-inch barrel as well as the standard size barrel of 7 inches.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nOf the most notable purchasers of these reconditioned model 3 Schofield revolvers was [[Wells Fargo and Company]], who purchased the revolvers for use by Wells Fargo Road Agents and had the barrels shortened to a more concealable 5 inches length. These revolvers were then inspected by the Wells Fargo armorer and uniquely stamped \"W.F. & Co\" or \"Wells Fargo & Co\", along with the original Smith & Wesson serial number re-stamped alongside the Wells Fargo stamping on the flat part of the barrel just forward of the barrel pivot as well as re-stamping any part of each revolver which had not originally been stamped or stamped in a location that would be difficult to view the serial number, when needed.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Wells Fargo Schofield revolvers became so popular with collectors from the 1970s onwards that the unique Wells Fargo markings were being \"counterfeited\" or \"faked\" by unscrupulous sellers to enhance the value of other similar versions that had not been genuinely owned by Wells Fargo & Co.  There are more \"fake\" Wells Fargo marked Schofield revolvers than genuine ones in existence and, accordingly, a collector interested in purchasing a \"Wells Fargo\" Schofield revolver would be well advised to have a pre-purchase inspection and verification performed by an expert who specializes in this model.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nLieutenant Colonel Schofield shot himself on December 17, 1882, with a S&W Schofield revolver after suffering a bout of mental illness, stress and isolation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Springfield Armory Museum|title=REVOLVER -  SMITH & WESSON REVOLVER MODEL 3 SCHOFIELD FIRST MODEL SINGLE ACTION .45 SN# 1532|url= http://ww2.rediscov.com/spring/VFPCGI.exe?IDCFile=/spring/DETAILS.IDC,SPECIFIC=9823,DATABASE=objects}}</ref>\n\nAn engraved, gold-plated New Model Number 3 with pearl grips was presented to sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]] in the 1890s by her husband Frank Butler.

In the previous engineering, the posts of the frame would wear out after heavy usage.  Schofield's improvement called for heat treated, replaceable components at this sensitive \"wear\" area of the catch and latch. The serial number range also will give an indication of whether it is First or Second Model, with the serial numbers changing from the First Model to the Second Model at a little over 3,000.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====New Model Number 3====\n[[File:S & W 3rd New Model.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, New Model, 44 Russian]]\nIn 1877, S&W discontinued production of its other Model 3s such as the American, Russian, and Schofield\u2014in favor a new improved design called the New Model Number Three. This new model has a longer cylinder allowing it to fire longer cartridges. Standard chambering was .44 Russian, although other calibers were offered on special order or in related models such as the .44-40 Frontier Model, the .32-44 & .38-44 Target Models, and the very rare .38-40 Winchester Model.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====Australian Model====\nIn 1880 the [[South Australia Police]], who were then interested in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted a display of New Model Number Three revolvers at the [[Australian Exposition]] in [[Melbourne]].  At the direction of [[William John Peterswald|Police Commissioner Peterswald]] an order was placed through S&W's New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in [[.44 Russian]] with a seven-inch barrel length. The order, which included extension shoulder stocks, ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at [[Adelaide]] in March 1882.  The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government [[Broad arrow#Use in Australia|broad arrow punch mark]], and were called [[revolver-carbines]].  They were issued to [[mounted police]], known as troopers, who at that period also policed the [[Northern Territory]].  Both the South Australia and [[Western Australia]] police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow.  For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T.  Nearly all serial numbers are known, and are listed in the book ''Service Arms of the South Australian Police''.<ref>''Service Arms of the South Australian Police : 1838 to 1988, the first 150 years'' by Max Slee : (Antique & Historical Arms Assoc., of South Australia, Adelaide, 1988) {{ISBN|0-7316-4078-0}}:</ref> The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of [[Los Angeles]].\n\n====Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action First Model====\n[[File:S&W 44 DA Frontier.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier]]\n\nThe Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier Revolver was made from 1881 to 1898. This revolver could be fired in both single- and [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double action]], and used the typical S&W top-break ejection system. Chambered primarily in [[.44 Russian]], as well as [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44-40]] it incorporated the company's familiar curved grip frame, with hard rubber or checkered walnut grips. It was available in blue and nickel-plated finishes, with 4, 5, 6, 6\u00bd and 8 inch barrels (the 5\" being the most common).\n<ref>https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2013/4/23/smith-wesson-44-double-action-first-model/</ref>\n\n==Copies==\nThe popular Model 3 was copied in many countries. Most common were the versions made in Spain, Mexico and Belgium; but companies such as [[Ludwig Loewe & Company]] of Germany and the [[Tula Arsenal]] in Russia played a hand in the counterfeit game, too. Copies have been found in Turkey and Pakistan as well, made by local manufacturers.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===11mm Orbea Hermanos y Cia. M1884 ''Sistema ON\u00c1'' (\"S&W Model 7\")===\n[[File:Rev\u00f3lver Orbea.jpg|thumb|An Orbea Hermanos revolver at the Seville Military History Museum.]]\n\nIn 1884 the Spanish government made a decree stating that any invention not copyrighted by their copyright office was not under their protection. One victim of this was Smith & Wesson, whose lucrative contract to produce Model 3 revolvers for the Spanish Army was quickly cancelled. Its work given to local gunsmiths in Eibar by different firms without any standardization of parts.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe [[Orbea|Orbea Hermanos]] ''Modelo 1884 Sistema ON\u00c1'' ([[Basque language|Basque]] ''on\u00e1'' > \"good\") or \"S&W Model 7\" revolver was made from 1884 until the 1920s. It is notable for its grip medallion, which is an \"OH\" interlaced like the Smith & Wesson \"S&W\".<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nAn interesting footnote is that Smith & Wesson immediately copyrighted all of their other designs in Spain from then on. That is why their firearms have MARCA REGISTRADA and the date of the Spanish patent on their barrels.<ref name=\"Lee2016\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=2016 Standard Catalog of Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide|date=29 January 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-1-4402-4441-4|page=1034}}</ref>\n\n===Liege copies===\nThere were a number of unauthorized Belgian copies made in [[.44 Russian]] and [[.44-40 Winchester]] as Single and Double Action revolvers. These copies, mostly manufactured in Liege, were marked as if to deceive a buyer into thinking that they were a revolver produced by Smith & Wesson. Many of the finer details such as the location of the Smith & Wesson factory were incorrectly stamped on the revolvers (\"New York\" and \"VK\" being the two most common).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nSmith & Wesson brought lawsuits against two gunmakers in Liege, which they originally lost, but won on appeal.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===Users===\n====Italy====\nThe prime contractor for the Italian military was Orbea, which chambered their revolvers for the Italian [[:it:10,35 x 20 mm|10.4mm cartridge]].  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I, and according to online sources were the preferred handgun of elite [[Arditi]] troops.\n\n====Philippines====\nMany Spanish firearms were captured by the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Liberation Army]] during the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]], among them Model 1884 revolvers. Some were brought by defectors from the Spanish military.  These handguns also saw service, later, in the [[Philippine-American War]].\n\n====Romania====\nRevolvers for the Romanian military were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, and were made by Trocaola, Aranzabal y C\u00eda.  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I.\n\n====Spain====\nSpain used these revolvers, which were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, during the Philippine Revolution, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the [[Rif War]], and the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe ''M1884'' was later briefly made chambered in .455 Webley for British government contracts in 1915 and 1916. It was designated by the British Army as the \"Pistol, Old Pattern\", due to its old design. They were dubbed \"Spanish Webleys\" by troops even though they were copies of the S&W Model 3. Orbea Hermanos y Cia., [[:es:G.A.C.|Garate, Anitua y Cia.]], and Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. were contracted to make 30,000 revolvers among them. Orbea Hermanos was the major contractor and the other two were sub-contractors. Rexach & Urgoite was later contracted in 1916 to make 500 pistols but all failed proofing and the lot was refused.\n\nFinish and quality control was varied throughout the run of production. The fact that they were making service pistols and revolvers for France and Italy at the same time was definitely a factor.\n\nAs there was no standardization of design or parts between manufacturers, each manufacturer's model was considered a different gun altogether. The Garate, Anitua y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.1 Mk.I'',<ref>Taylerson-Chamberlain, W. H. J. and A. W. F. ''Revolvers of the British Services, 1854-1944'', pp. 57-59.</ref><ref>Maze, Robert J. ''Howdah to High Power \u2013 A Century of British Breechloading Service Pistols (1867-1967)'', pp. 93-94</ref> the Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.I'', and the Orbea Hermanos model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.3 Mk.I''.\n\nThe weapons were given to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] after the war. The RUC later sold them off to the [[New South Wales Police Force]], who made snub-nosed revolvers out of them and issued them as backup pistols. A cut-down snub-nosed .455 \"Old Pattern\" Revolver was carried by one of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]' bodyguards.\n\n==Modern reproductions==\nModern reproductions of the Smith & Wesson model 3 Revolver are made by a number of companies, including (most notably) Smith & Wesson themselves, as well as the Italian arms-makers [[A.
