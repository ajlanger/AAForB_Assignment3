Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], [[Rockland County]], and [[Westchester County]], he is sometimes compared to [[Baron Haussmann]] of [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] [[Paris]], and was one of the most [[polarization (politics)|polarizing]] figures in the history of urban development in the United States. His decisions favoring highways over [[public transit]] helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation of [[engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[urban planner]]s who spread his philosophies across the nation despite his not having been trained in those professions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moses would call himself a \"coordinator\" and was referred to in the media as a \"master builder\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRobert Moses at one point held 12 titles simultaneously (including [[New York City Parks Commissioner]] and Chairman of the [[Long Island State Park Commission]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/environment/the-legacy-of-robert-moses/16018/|title=The legacy of Robert Moses|last=Sarachan|first=Sydney|date=2013-01-17|website=Need to Know {{!}} PBS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>, but was never elected to any public office ([[1934 New York state election|he ran only once]], for governor of New York as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1934 and lost to [[Herbert H. Lehman]] in a landslide). Nevertheless, he created and led numerous [[Public authority|public authorities]] that gave him autonomy from the general public and elected officials. Through these authorities, he controlled millions of dollars in income from his projects, such as tolls, and he could issue bonds to borrow vast sums for new ventures with little or no input from legislative bodies. This removed him from the [[power of the purse]] as it normally functioned in the United States, and from the process of [[public comment]] on major [[public work]]s. As a result of Moses' work, New York has the United States' greatest proportion of [[New York state public-benefit corporations|public benefit corporations]], which are the prime mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York and account for most of the state's debt.\n\nMoses' projects were considered by many to be necessary for the region's development after the [[Great Depression]]. During the height of his powers, New York City built campuses to host two [[World's Fair]]s: one in [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and the other in [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964]]. Moses also helped persuade the [[United Nations]] to locate [[Headquarters of the United Nations|its headquarters]] in [[Manhattan]], instead of in [[Philadelphia]], by helping the state secure the money and land needed for the project.\n\nMoses' reputation for efficiency and nonpartisan leadership was permanently damaged by [[Robert Caro]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography ''[[The Power Broker]]'' (1974), which exposed Moses's lust for power, questionable ethics, vindictiveness and racism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=October 23, 2015 |title=The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert Caro review \u2013 a landmark study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/the-power-broker-robert-moses-and-the-fall-of-new-york-robert-caro-review |work=The Guardian |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and rise to power==\nMoses was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to assimilated [[German Jewish]] parents, Bella (Silverman) and Emanuel Moses.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1218.html | title=Robert Moses, Master Builder, is Dead at 92}}</ref> He spent the first nine years of his life living at 83 Dwight Street in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], two blocks from [[Yale University]].

A committed [[idealism|idealist]], he developed several plans to rid New York of [[Patronage#Politics|patronage hiring]] practices, including being the lead author of a 1919 proposal to reorganize the New York state government. None went very far, but Moses, due to his intelligence, caught the notice of [[Belle Moskowitz]], a friend and trusted advisor to Governor [[Al Smith]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}}  When the state [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]]'s position became appointive rather than elective, Smith named Moses; Moses served from 1927 to 1929.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 19, 1928 |title=Moses Resigns State Position |url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS19281219.2.63.7# |newspaper=Cornell Daily Sun |location=Ithaca, NY |page=8}}</ref>\n\nMoses rose to power with Smith, who was elected as governor in 1922, and set in motion a sweeping consolidation of the New York State government.

While New York City and New York State were perpetually strapped for money, the bridge's toll revenues amounted to tens of millions of dollars a year.

Bridges can be wider and cheaper to build, but taller and longer bridges use more ramp space at landfall than tunnels do.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} A \"Brooklyn Battery Bridge\" would have decimated [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] and physically encroached on the financial district, and for this reason, the bridge was opposed by the [[Regional Plan Association]], historical preservationists, [[Wall Street]] financial interests, property owners, various high society people, [[construction]] [[labor union|unions]], the Manhattan [[borough president]], Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], and governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Despite this, Moses favored a bridge, which could both carry more automobile traffic and serve as a higher visibility monument than a tunnel. LaGuardia and Lehman as usual had little money to spend, in part due to the [[Great Depression]], while the federal government was running low on funds after recently spending $105 million ($1.8 billion in 2016) on the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] and other City projects and refused to provide any additional funds to New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/brooklyn-battery/ |title=Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (I-478) |publisher=Nycroads.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> Awash in funds from Triborough Bridge tolls, Moses deemed that money could only be spent on a bridge. He also clashed with chief engineer of the project, [[Ole Singstad]], who preferred a tunnel instead of a bridge.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nOnly a lack of a key federal approval thwarted the bridge project. President Roosevelt ordered the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to assert that [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] a bridge in that location would block [[East River]] access to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] upstream. Thwarted, Moses dismantled the [[New York Aquarium]] on [[Castle Clinton]] and moved it to [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, where it grew much bigger. This was in apparent retaliation, based on specious claims that the proposed tunnel would undermine Castle Clinton's foundation. He also attempted to raze Castle Clinton itself, the historic fort surviving only after being transferred to the federal government.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Moses now had no other option for a trans-river crossing than to build a tunnel. He commissioned the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel]] (now officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel), a tunnel connecting Brooklyn to [[Lower Manhattan]]. A 1941 publication from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority claimed that the government had forced them to build a tunnel at \"twice the cost, twice the operating fees, twice the difficulty to engineer, and half the traffic,\" although engineering studies did not support these conclusions, and a tunnel may have held many of the advantages Moses publicly tried to attach to the bridge option.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nThis had not been the first time Moses pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel Authority when the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] was being planned.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/queens-midtown/ |title=Queens-Midtown Tunnel |website=NYCRoads.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> He had raised the same arguments, which failed due to their lack of political support.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\"/>\n\n===Post-war influence of urban development and projects===\n[[File:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[headquarters of the United&nbsp;Nations]] in New York City, viewed from the [[East River]].

This set of buildings straddles the [[FDR Drive]], another of Moses's creations.]]\nMoses's power increased after [[World War II]] after Mayor LaGuardia retired and a series of successors consented to almost all of his proposals. Named city \"construction coordinator\" in 1946 by Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]], Moses became New York City's ''de facto'' representative in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Moses was also given powers over [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing]] that had eluded him under LaGuardia. When O'Dwyer was forced to resign in disgrace and was succeeded by [[Vincent R. Impellitteri]], Moses was able to assume even greater behind-the-scenes control over [[infrastructure]] projects.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} One of Moses's first steps after Impellitteri took office was halting the creation of a citywide Comprehensive Zoning Plan underway since 1938 that would have curtailed his nearly unlimited power to build within the city and removed the Zoning Commissioner from power in the process. Moses was also empowered as the sole authority to negotiate in Washington for New York City projects. By 1959, he had overseen construction of 28,000 apartment units on hundreds of acres of land. In clearing the land for high-rises in accordance with the [[towers in the park]] concept, which at that time was seen as innovative and beneficial by leaving more grassy areas between high-rises, Moses sometimes destroyed almost as many housing units as he built.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s, Robert Moses was responsible for the construction of the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]], the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge|Marine Parkway]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge|Throgs Neck]], the [[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge|Bronx-Whitestone]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge|Henry Hudson]], and the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano\u2013Narrows]] bridges. His other projects included the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] and [[Staten Island Expressway]], which together comprised most of [[Interstate 278]]; the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]]; many New York State [[Parkway (New York)|parkways]]; and other highways. Federal interest had shifted from parkway to [[freeway]] systems, and the new roads mostly conformed to the new vision, lacking the landscaping or the commercial traffic restrictions of the pre-war highways. He was the mover behind [[Shea Stadium]] and [[Lincoln Center]], and contributed to the [[United Nations headquarters]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses had influence outside the New York area as well. Public officials in many smaller American cities hired him to design freeway networks in the 1940s and early 1950s. For example, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] hired Moses in 1943; his plan included a loop around the [[Downtown Portland|city center]], with [[spur route|spurs]] running through neighborhoods. Of this plan, only [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]], its links with [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|I-5]], and the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]] were built.<ref>{{cite web| title= Feb. 4, 1974: Portland kills the Mount Hood Freeway| url= http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html | date= November 5, 2014| first= Aaron|last= Mesh | publisher= [[Willamette Week]] | quote= Every great civilization has an origin story.

Around this time, Moses' political acumen began to fail him, as he unwisely picked several controversial political battles he could not possibly win. For example, his campaign against the free [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] program received much negative publicity, and his effort to destroy a shaded playground in [[Central Park]] to make way for a parking lot for the expensive [[Tavern on the Green|Tavern-on-the-Green]] restaurant earned him many enemies among the middle-class voters of the [[Upper West Side]].\n\nThe opposition reached a climax over the demolition of [[Pennsylvania Station (former building)|Pennsylvania Station]], which many attributed to the \"development scheme\" mentality cultivated by Moses<ref>{{cite news |title=Rethinking Robert Moses |first=Phillip |last=Lopate |url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301063044/http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |magazine=[[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]] |date=March 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> even though it was the impoverished [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] that was actually responsible for the demolition.<ref name=\"The Nation\">{{Cite journal |title=Robert Moses: The Master Builder |first=Jane Holtz |last=Kay |url=http://www.janeholtzkay.com/articles/masterbuilder.pdf |journal=The Nation |date=April 24, 1989 |volume=248 |page=569 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |issue=16 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This casual destruction of one of New York's greatest architectural landmarks helped prompt many city residents to turn against Moses's plans to build a [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], which would have gone through [[Greenwich Village]] and what is now [[SoHo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2007/05/robert-moses-new-york-citys-master.html |title=Environmental and Urban Economics: Robert Moses: New York City's Master Builder? |publisher=Greeneconomics.blogspot.com |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> This plan and the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] both failed politically.

His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties in the face of evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities.<ref name=\"Nexus\"/> In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the [[Bureau of International Expositions]] (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating to the success of the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGMdyCdCT9c|title=Robert Moses: Long Island's Master Builder|website=YouTube|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate.<ref name=\"learn.columbia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/moses/|title=Robert Moses|publisher=Learn.columbia.edu|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> The United States had already staged the sanctioned [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1962. According to the rules of the organization, no one nation could host more than one fair in a decade. The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].\n\nAfter the World's Fair debacle, New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]], along with Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], sought to direct toll revenues from the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]]'s (TBTA) bridges and tunnels to cover deficits in the city's then financially ailing agencies, including the [[New York City Subway|subway system]]. Moses opposed this idea and fought to prevent it.<ref name=\"The Nation\"/> Lindsay then removed Moses from his post as the city's chief advocate for federal highway money in Washington.\n\nThe legislature's vote to fold the TBTA into the newly created [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) could have led to a lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders. Since the bond contracts were written into state law, it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], headed then by [[David Rockefeller]], the governor's brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA to go to court against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out\u2014the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/>\n\nMoses had thought he had convinced Nelson Rockefeller of the need for one last great bridge project, a span [[Long Island Crossing|crossing Long Island Sound]] from [[Rye (town), New York|Rye]] to [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]]. Rockefeller did not press for the project in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban Republicans would hinder his re-election prospects. A 1972 study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally manageable (according to the comparatively low environmental impact parameters of that period), but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge.\n\n====''The Power Broker''====\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?112640-1/power-broker-robert-moses Presentation by Robert Caro on Robert Moses and urban development at the Brookings Institution, September 28, 1998], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Main|The Power Broker}}\nMoses's image suffered a further blow in 1974 with the publication of ''[[The Power Broker]]'', a [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning biography by [[Robert A.

Caro's 1,200-page opus (edited down from over 3,000 pages) showed Moses generally in a negative light; essayist [[Phillip Lopate]] writes that \"Moses's satanic reputation with the public can be traced, in the main, to ...

Moses is blamed for having destroyed more than a score of neighborhoods by building 13 expressways across New York City and by building large [[urban renewal]] projects with little regard for the urban fabric or for human scale.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Yet the author is more neutral in his central premise: the city would have developed much differently without Moses. Other U.S. cities were doing the same thing as New York in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; [[Central Artery|Boston]], [[Embarcadero Freeway|San Francisco]], and [[Alaskan Way Viaduct|Seattle]], for instance, each built highways straight through their downtown areas.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} The New York City architectural [[intelligentsia]] of the 1940s and 1950s, who largely believed in such proponents of the automobile as [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], had supported Moses. Many other cities, like [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Chicago]], and [[St. Louis]], also built massive, unattractive public housing projects.<ref>{{cite news |title=Great Cities Need Great Builders |first=Edward |last=Glaeser |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/great-cities-need-great-builders/47012/ |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |date=January 19, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|1974}} However, Caro also points out that Moses [[#Racism|demonstrated racist tendencies]].{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=510, 514}}  These allegedly included opposing black World War II veterans to move into a residential complex specifically designed for these veterans,<ref name=nyplmoses/> {{Failed verification|date=December 2019}} and purportedly trying to make swimming pool water cold in order to drive away potential African American residents in white neighborhoods.<ref name=nyt2cities/>\n\nPeople had come to see Moses as a bully who disregarded public input, but until the publication of Caro's book, they had not known many details of his private life\u2014for instance, that his brother Paul had spent much of his life in poverty.

A hydro-electric power dam in [[Massena, New York]] also bears Moses' name. Moses also has a school named after him in [[North Babylon, New York]] on Long Island; there is also a [[Robert Moses Playground]] in New York City. There are other signs of the surviving appreciation held for him by some circles of the public. A statue of Moses was erected next to the [[Village hall|Village Hall]] in his long-time hometown, [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon Village, New York]], in 2003, as well as a bust on the [[Lincoln Center]] campus of [[Fordham University]], although it has since been removed from display and is currently in storage.\n\nDuring his tenure as chief of the state park system, the state's inventory of parks grew to nearly {{Convert|2600000|acre}}.

The book highlighted his practice of starting large projects well beyond funding approved by the New York State legislature, with the knowledge they would eventually have to pay for the rest to avoid looking like they had failed to review the project properly (this is a tactic known as {{italics correction|''[[:wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''}}). He was also characterized as using his political power to benefit cronies, including a case where he secretly shifted the planned route of the [[Northern State Parkway]] large distances to avoid impinging on the estates of the rich, while telling owners of the family farms who lost land and sometimes their livelihood, that it was based on \"engineering considerations\".{{sfn|Caro|1974}} The book charged that Moses [[libel]]ed other officials who opposed him, to have them removed from office, calling some of them [[communist]]s during the [[Red Scare]]. The biography further notes that Moses fought against schools and other public needs in favor of his preference for parks.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses's critics charge that he preferred automobiles over people. They point out that he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the [[South Bronx]] and the [[amusement park]]s of [[Coney Island]], caused the departure of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to [[disinvestment]] and neglect.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} His building of expressways hindered the [[proposed expansion of the New York City Subway]] from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 [[Program for Action]], which was never completed, was hoped to counter this.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Other critics charge that he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built.\n\n====Racism====\n\nCaro's ''The Power Broker'' accused Moses of building the bridges across his parkways low in order to \"restrict the use of state parks by poor and lower-middle-class families,\" who did not own cars and would arrive by bus, and of discouraging blacks, in particular, from visiting Jones Beach, the centerpiece of the Long Island state park system, by such measures as making it difficult for black groups to get permits to park buses even if they came anyway (by other roads); assigning black lifeguards to \"distant, less developed beaches\" instead; and keeping the water temperature in the pool low.{{sfn|Caro}} While the exclusion of commercial vehicles, and the use of low bridges where appropriate, were standard on earlier parkways, where they had been instituted for aesthetic reasons, Moses appears to have made greater use of low bridges, which his aide Sidney Shapiro said was done in order to make it more difficult for future legislators to allow commercial vehicles.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=952}}<ref name=\"Campanella\">{{cite web |last1=Campanella |first1=Thomas |title=How Low Did He Go? |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/how-low-did-he-go/533019/ |website=Citylab |accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nMoses vocally opposed allowing black war veterans to move into [[Stuyvesant Town]], a Manhattan residential development complex created to house World War II veterans.<ref name=nyplmoses>{{cite web |title=Wrestling with Moses: How Jane Jacobs Took on New York's Master Builder and Transformed the American City |first=Cynthia |last=Chaldekas |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/03/16/wrestling-moses-jane-jacobs |website=[[New York Public Library]] |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|1974}} In response to the biography, Moses defended his forced displacement of poor and minority communities as an inevitable part of urban revitalization, stating \"I raise my stein to the builder who can remove [[ghetto]]s without moving people as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs.\"<ref name=\"Boeing2017Moses\" /> Additionally, close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in neighborhoods with predominantly white populations by making the water too cold.<ref name=nyt2cities>{{Cite news|title=A Tale of Two Cities |first=Michael |last=Powell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/nyregion/thecity/06hist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |quote=As for the pool-cooling, Mr. Caro interviewed Moses's associates on the record (\"You can pretty well keep them out of any pool if you keep the water cold enough,\" he quotes Sidney M.

Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], [[Rockland County]], and [[Westchester County]], he is sometimes compared to [[Baron Haussmann]] of [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] [[Paris]], and was one of the most [[polarization (politics)|polarizing]] figures in the history of urban development in the United States. His decisions favoring highways over [[public transit]] helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation of [[engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[urban planner]]s who spread his philosophies across the nation despite his not having been trained in those professions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moses would call himself a \"coordinator\" and was referred to in the media as a \"master builder\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRobert Moses at one point held 12 titles simultaneously (including [[New York City Parks Commissioner]] and Chairman of the [[Long Island State Park Commission]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/environment/the-legacy-of-robert-moses/16018/|title=The legacy of Robert Moses|last=Sarachan|first=Sydney|date=2013-01-17|website=Need to Know {{!}} PBS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>, but was never elected to any public office ([[1934 New York state election|he ran only once]], for governor of New York as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1934 and lost to [[Herbert H. Lehman]] in a landslide). Nevertheless, he created and led numerous [[Public authority|public authorities]] that gave him autonomy from the general public and elected officials. Through these authorities, he controlled millions of dollars in income from his projects, such as tolls, and he could issue bonds to borrow vast sums for new ventures with little or no input from legislative bodies. This removed him from the [[power of the purse]] as it normally functioned in the United States, and from the process of [[public comment]] on major [[public work]]s. As a result of Moses' work, New York has the United States' greatest proportion of [[New York state public-benefit corporations|public benefit corporations]], which are the prime mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York and account for most of the state's debt.\n\nMoses' projects were considered by many to be necessary for the region's development after the [[Great Depression]]. During the height of his powers, New York City built campuses to host two [[World's Fair]]s: one in [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and the other in [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964]]. Moses also helped persuade the [[United Nations]] to locate [[Headquarters of the United Nations|its headquarters]] in [[Manhattan]], instead of in [[Philadelphia]], by helping the state secure the money and land needed for the project.\n\nMoses' reputation for efficiency and nonpartisan leadership was permanently damaged by [[Robert Caro]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography ''[[The Power Broker]]'' (1974), which exposed Moses's lust for power, questionable ethics, vindictiveness and racism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=October 23, 2015 |title=The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert Caro review \u2013 a landmark study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/the-power-broker-robert-moses-and-the-fall-of-new-york-robert-caro-review |work=The Guardian |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and rise to power==\nMoses was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to assimilated [[German Jewish]] parents, Bella (Silverman) and Emanuel Moses.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1218.html | title=Robert Moses, Master Builder, is Dead at 92}}</ref> He spent the first nine years of his life living at 83 Dwight Street in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], two blocks from [[Yale University]].

In order for the family to move to New York City, he sold his real estate holdings and store and retired from business for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=29}} Moses' mother was active in the [[settlement movement]], with her own love of building. Robert Moses and his brother Paul attended several schools for their elementary and [[secondary education]], including the [[Dwight School]] and the [[Mohegan Lake School]], a military academy near [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]].{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=35}}\n\nAfter graduating from [[Yale University]] (B.A., 1909) and [[Wadham College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] (B.A., Jurisprudence, 1911; M.A., 1913), and earning a Ph.D. in [[political science]] from [[Columbia University]], Moses became attracted to New York City reform politics. A committed [[idealism|idealist]], he developed several plans to rid New York of [[Patronage#Politics|patronage hiring]] practices, including being the lead author of a 1919 proposal to reorganize the New York state government. None went very far, but Moses, due to his intelligence, caught the notice of [[Belle Moskowitz]], a friend and trusted advisor to Governor [[Al Smith]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}}  When the state [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]]'s position became appointive rather than elective, Smith named Moses; Moses served from 1927 to 1929.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 19, 1928 |title=Moses Resigns State Position |url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS19281219.2.63.7# |newspaper=Cornell Daily Sun |location=Ithaca, NY |page=8}}</ref>\n\nMoses rose to power with Smith, who was elected as governor in 1922, and set in motion a sweeping consolidation of the New York State government. During that period Moses began his first foray into large scale public work initiatives, while drawing on Smith's political power to enact legislation. This helped create the new [[Long Island State Park Commission]] and the State Council of Parks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gutfreund|first=Owen|title=Moses, Robert|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/07/07-00375.html|publisher=Anb.org|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> In 1924, Governor Alfred E.

A 'Reconstruction Commission' headed by Moses produced a highly influential report that provided recommendations that would largely be adopted, including the consolidation of 187 existing agencies under eighteen departments, a new executive budget system, and the four-year term limit for the governorship.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=106, 260}}\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Moses, along with Mayor [[Fiorello H.

Language in its Authority's [[Bond (finance)|bond]] contracts and multi-year Commissioner appointments made it largely impervious to pressure from mayors and governors. While New York City and New York State were perpetually strapped for money, the bridge's toll revenues amounted to tens of millions of dollars a year. The Authority was thus able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars by selling bonds, a method also used by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empire on the Hudson|last=Doig|first=Jameson W.|date=2002-11-15|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231076777|language=English|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/empireonhudson00jame}}</ref> to fund large public construction projects.

Bridges can be wider and cheaper to build, but taller and longer bridges use more ramp space at landfall than tunnels do.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} A \"Brooklyn Battery Bridge\" would have decimated [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] and physically encroached on the financial district, and for this reason, the bridge was opposed by the [[Regional Plan Association]], historical preservationists, [[Wall Street]] financial interests, property owners, various high society people, [[construction]] [[labor union|unions]], the Manhattan [[borough president]], Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], and governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Despite this, Moses favored a bridge, which could both carry more automobile traffic and serve as a higher visibility monument than a tunnel. LaGuardia and Lehman as usual had little money to spend, in part due to the [[Great Depression]], while the federal government was running low on funds after recently spending $105 million ($1.8 billion in 2016) on the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] and other City projects and refused to provide any additional funds to New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/brooklyn-battery/ |title=Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (I-478) |publisher=Nycroads.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> Awash in funds from Triborough Bridge tolls, Moses deemed that money could only be spent on a bridge. He also clashed with chief engineer of the project, [[Ole Singstad]], who preferred a tunnel instead of a bridge.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nOnly a lack of a key federal approval thwarted the bridge project. President Roosevelt ordered the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to assert that [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] a bridge in that location would block [[East River]] access to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] upstream. Thwarted, Moses dismantled the [[New York Aquarium]] on [[Castle Clinton]] and moved it to [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, where it grew much bigger. This was in apparent retaliation, based on specious claims that the proposed tunnel would undermine Castle Clinton's foundation. He also attempted to raze Castle Clinton itself, the historic fort surviving only after being transferred to the federal government.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Moses now had no other option for a trans-river crossing than to build a tunnel. He commissioned the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel]] (now officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel), a tunnel connecting Brooklyn to [[Lower Manhattan]]. A 1941 publication from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority claimed that the government had forced them to build a tunnel at \"twice the cost, twice the operating fees, twice the difficulty to engineer, and half the traffic,\" although engineering studies did not support these conclusions, and a tunnel may have held many of the advantages Moses publicly tried to attach to the bridge option.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nThis had not been the first time Moses pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel Authority when the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] was being planned.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/queens-midtown/ |title=Queens-Midtown Tunnel |website=NYCRoads.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> He had raised the same arguments, which failed due to their lack of political support.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\"/>\n\n===Post-war influence of urban development and projects===\n[[File:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[headquarters of the United&nbsp;Nations]] in New York City, viewed from the [[East River]].

Named city \"construction coordinator\" in 1946 by Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]], Moses became New York City's ''de facto'' representative in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Moses was also given powers over [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing]] that had eluded him under LaGuardia. When O'Dwyer was forced to resign in disgrace and was succeeded by [[Vincent R. Impellitteri]], Moses was able to assume even greater behind-the-scenes control over [[infrastructure]] projects.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} One of Moses's first steps after Impellitteri took office was halting the creation of a citywide Comprehensive Zoning Plan underway since 1938 that would have curtailed his nearly unlimited power to build within the city and removed the Zoning Commissioner from power in the process. Moses was also empowered as the sole authority to negotiate in Washington for New York City projects. By 1959, he had overseen construction of 28,000 apartment units on hundreds of acres of land. In clearing the land for high-rises in accordance with the [[towers in the park]] concept, which at that time was seen as innovative and beneficial by leaving more grassy areas between high-rises, Moses sometimes destroyed almost as many housing units as he built.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s, Robert Moses was responsible for the construction of the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]], the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge|Marine Parkway]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge|Throgs Neck]], the [[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge|Bronx-Whitestone]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge|Henry Hudson]], and the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano\u2013Narrows]] bridges. His other projects included the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] and [[Staten Island Expressway]], which together comprised most of [[Interstate 278]]; the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]]; many New York State [[Parkway (New York)|parkways]]; and other highways. Federal interest had shifted from parkway to [[freeway]] systems, and the new roads mostly conformed to the new vision, lacking the landscaping or the commercial traffic restrictions of the pre-war highways. He was the mover behind [[Shea Stadium]] and [[Lincoln Center]], and contributed to the [[United Nations headquarters]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses had influence outside the New York area as well. Public officials in many smaller American cities hired him to design freeway networks in the 1940s and early 1950s. For example, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] hired Moses in 1943; his plan included a loop around the [[Downtown Portland|city center]], with [[spur route|spurs]] running through neighborhoods. Of this plan, only [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]], its links with [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|I-5]], and the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]] were built.<ref>{{cite web| title= Feb. 4, 1974: Portland kills the Mount Hood Freeway| url= http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html | date= November 5, 2014| first= Aaron|last= Mesh | publisher= [[Willamette Week]] | quote= Every great civilization has an origin story.

Around this time, Moses' political acumen began to fail him, as he unwisely picked several controversial political battles he could not possibly win. For example, his campaign against the free [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] program received much negative publicity, and his effort to destroy a shaded playground in [[Central Park]] to make way for a parking lot for the expensive [[Tavern on the Green|Tavern-on-the-Green]] restaurant earned him many enemies among the middle-class voters of the [[Upper West Side]].\n\nThe opposition reached a climax over the demolition of [[Pennsylvania Station (former building)|Pennsylvania Station]], which many attributed to the \"development scheme\" mentality cultivated by Moses<ref>{{cite news |title=Rethinking Robert Moses |first=Phillip |last=Lopate |url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301063044/http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |magazine=[[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]] |date=March 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> even though it was the impoverished [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] that was actually responsible for the demolition.<ref name=\"The Nation\">{{Cite journal |title=Robert Moses: The Master Builder |first=Jane Holtz |last=Kay |url=http://www.janeholtzkay.com/articles/masterbuilder.pdf |journal=The Nation |date=April 24, 1989 |volume=248 |page=569 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |issue=16 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This casual destruction of one of New York's greatest architectural landmarks helped prompt many city residents to turn against Moses's plans to build a [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], which would have gone through [[Greenwich Village]] and what is now [[SoHo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2007/05/robert-moses-new-york-citys-master.html |title=Environmental and Urban Economics: Robert Moses: New York City's Master Builder? |publisher=Greeneconomics.blogspot.com |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> This plan and the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] both failed politically.

His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties in the face of evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities.<ref name=\"Nexus\"/> In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the [[Bureau of International Expositions]] (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating to the success of the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGMdyCdCT9c|title=Robert Moses: Long Island's Master Builder|website=YouTube|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate.<ref name=\"learn.columbia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/moses/|title=Robert Moses|publisher=Learn.columbia.edu|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> The United States had already staged the sanctioned [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1962.

The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].\n\nAfter the World's Fair debacle, New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]], along with Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], sought to direct toll revenues from the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]]'s (TBTA) bridges and tunnels to cover deficits in the city's then financially ailing agencies, including the [[New York City Subway|subway system]]. Moses opposed this idea and fought to prevent it.<ref name=\"The Nation\"/> Lindsay then removed Moses from his post as the city's chief advocate for federal highway money in Washington.\n\nThe legislature's vote to fold the TBTA into the newly created [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) could have led to a lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders. Since the bond contracts were written into state law, it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], headed then by [[David Rockefeller]], the governor's brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA to go to court against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out\u2014the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/>\n\nMoses had thought he had convinced Nelson Rockefeller of the need for one last great bridge project, a span [[Long Island Crossing|crossing Long Island Sound]] from [[Rye (town), New York|Rye]] to [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]]. Rockefeller did not press for the project in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban Republicans would hinder his re-election prospects. A 1972 study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally manageable (according to the comparatively low environmental impact parameters of that period), but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge.\n\n====''The Power Broker''====\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?112640-1/power-broker-robert-moses Presentation by Robert Caro on Robert Moses and urban development at the Brookings Institution, September 28, 1998], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Main|The Power Broker}}\nMoses's image suffered a further blow in 1974 with the publication of ''[[The Power Broker]]'', a [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning biography by [[Robert A.

He was also characterized as using his political power to benefit cronies, including a case where he secretly shifted the planned route of the [[Northern State Parkway]] large distances to avoid impinging on the estates of the rich, while telling owners of the family farms who lost land and sometimes their livelihood, that it was based on \"engineering considerations\".{{sfn|Caro|1974}} The book charged that Moses [[libel]]ed other officials who opposed him, to have them removed from office, calling some of them [[communist]]s during the [[Red Scare]]. The biography further notes that Moses fought against schools and other public needs in favor of his preference for parks.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses's critics charge that he preferred automobiles over people. They point out that he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the [[South Bronx]] and the [[amusement park]]s of [[Coney Island]], caused the departure of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to [[disinvestment]] and neglect.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} His building of expressways hindered the [[proposed expansion of the New York City Subway]] from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 [[Program for Action]], which was never completed, was hoped to counter this.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Other critics charge that he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built.\n\n====Racism====\n\nCaro's ''The Power Broker'' accused Moses of building the bridges across his parkways low in order to \"restrict the use of state parks by poor and lower-middle-class families,\" who did not own cars and would arrive by bus, and of discouraging blacks, in particular, from visiting Jones Beach, the centerpiece of the Long Island state park system, by such measures as making it difficult for black groups to get permits to park buses even if they came anyway (by other roads); assigning black lifeguards to \"distant, less developed beaches\" instead; and keeping the water temperature in the pool low.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=318-319}}. While the exclusion of commercial vehicles, and the use of low bridges where appropriate, were standard on earlier parkways, where they had been instituted for aesthetic reasons, Moses appears to have made greater use of low bridges, which his aide Sidney Shapiro said was done in order to make it more difficult for future legislators to allow commercial vehicles.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=952}}<ref name=\"Campanella\">{{cite web |last1=Campanella |first1=Thomas |title=How Low Did He Go? |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/how-low-did-he-go/533019/ |website=Citylab |accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nMoses vocally opposed allowing black war veterans to move into [[Stuyvesant Town]], a Manhattan residential development complex created to house World War II veterans.<ref name=nyplmoses>{{cite web |title=Wrestling with Moses: How Jane Jacobs Took on New York's Master Builder and Transformed the American City |first=Cynthia |last=Chaldekas |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/03/16/wrestling-moses-jane-jacobs |website=[[New York Public Library]] |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|1974}} In response to the biography, Moses defended his forced displacement of poor and minority communities as an inevitable part of urban revitalization, stating \"I raise my stein to the builder who can remove [[ghetto]]s without moving people as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs.\"<ref name=\"Boeing2017Moses\" /> Additionally, close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in neighborhoods with predominantly white populations by making the water too cold.<ref name=nyt2cities>{{Cite news|title=A Tale of Two Cities |first=Michael |last=Powell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/nyregion/thecity/06hist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |quote=As for the pool-cooling, Mr. Caro interviewed Moses's associates on the record (\"You can pretty well keep them out of any pool if you keep the water cold enough,\" he quotes Sidney M.

And that causes us to look at our infrastructure,\" said Jackson. \"A lot of big projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses,\" he added.<ref name=\"nyt-2007-01-28\"/> Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the [[Regional Plan Association]] on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect [[Eliot Spitzer]] stated a biography of Moses written today might be called ''At Least He Got It Built'': \"That's what we need today.
