It was first built in 1810.\n\nThe limit of legal powers between the [[Port of London Authority]], the navigation authority downstream to the [[North Sea]] and that upstream to small headwaters of the river, the [[Environment Agency]], is marked nearby by an [[obelisk]] on the \"[[Surrey]]\" ([[Thames Path|towpath]], right) bank.{{refn|group=n|A bank of the River Thames by convention takes as its name its [[Historic counties of England|Historic county]], [[boxing the compass|compass point]] or a general north ([[Bank (geography)|left]]) or general south (right) description}}  The [[weir]] named '''Teddington Weir''' marks the river's usual [[tidal limit]] and is the lowest on the Thames. This lock is the lowest full-tide lock and second lowest of all-tide locks on the Thames.\n\nThe complex of civil engineering or infrastructure in essence consists of a large long weir and three locks: a conventional launch lock in regular use, very large barge lock and a small [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock. The barge lock was made to accommodate long barges, steamers or [[passenger ferry|passenger ferries]] and has an additional set of gates half-way to operate more quickly for shorter craft. The staggered structures incorporate two reinforced narrow islands. The upper island is traversed by and accessible by the [[lock (water navigation)|lock gate]]s or [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==Location and design==\nThe greater lock is against the general south (right, towpath or Surrey) bank of the river which is for 500&nbsp;m north-east here{{refn|group=n|As the south bank is north-east or north, as beside the commercial district [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] which is centred {{convert|2.2|mi}} north, the Thames at Teddington Lock flows westward against its strongly eastward general flow; downstream of [[Oxfordshire]] other such circuitous [[meander]]s are at [[Wargrave]], for a few metres in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and at the [[Greenwich Peninsula]]}}; a middle lock being that most regularly used spans a long thin island which has lawns, places for boat owners to sit and a lock keeper's cabin and short thin island which is a thin wedge of concrete and a broad canoe/kayak stepped portage facility.\n\nThe river downstream of the lock is the Richmond and Twickenham reach of the [[Tideway]], a {{convert|3.2|mi|adj=on}} reach of semi-[[tide|tidal]] river due to the fact the [[Richmond Lock and Footbridge|Richmond Lock and half-tide barrages]] limits the fall of water thereby maintaining a head of water to aid navigability at and around low tide.{{refn|group=n|See [[tidal barrage]].}}\n\nThough the weir at '''Teddington Weir''' marks the managed river's usual [[tidal limit]], after prolonged rainfall causing very high fluvial flow, specifically at high tide, a higher limit of [[slack water|slack water (stand of the tide)]] causes [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] to arise as far upstream as [[East Molesey|the top of this reach]], the [[Molesey Lock|next lock]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26133660 |title=How does the Thames Barrier stop London flooding? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2014 |access-date= 26 March 2019|first=Tom |last=de Castella}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6080&p=0 |title=Operation of the Thames Barrier |publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe large, bow-shaped '''Teddington Weir''' is against the opposite bank. A series of two footbridges at differing heights make up a structure which crosses the locks, the middle island that has the lock keeper's cabin and the weir pool, [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==History==\n===First lock, 1810===\nThe [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]] obtained in April 1771 by the Thames Navigation Commission did not allow them to build locks below [[Maidenhead Bridge]],{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=153}} but from 1802, several plans for locks in the First District of the Thames, stretching from Staines to Teddington, were drawn up. Stephen Leach took over the post of Clerk of Works for the First District in 1802, following the retirement of Charles Truss at the age of 82. Just before his retirement, Truss proposed locks at Molesey and Teddington, each having a weir with long tumbling bays, similar to modern practice. [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] had suggested a series of long cuts in 1794, and Truss adopted the same idea. Rennie and [[William Jessop]] again proposed four long cuts in 1805, each about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but the Navigation Committee were thwarted by strong opposition from landowners.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}\n\nZacchary Allnutt, by then Surveyor for the Second and Third Districts, stretching from Staines to [[Mapledurham Lock|Mapledurham]] near Reading, suggested locks at Chertsey, Sunbury and Teddington in 1805. Rennie submitted new proposals in 1809 for nine locks between Staines and Twickenham; two would be without weirs, seven would require large weirs to be built. Finally Leach drafted plans in 1810, which he suggested were \"at once practicable and expedient, the least expensive, and the most likely to pass through Parliament without opposition and yet calculated to remedy the most prominent evils complained of.\" An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained by the [[City of London Corporation]] in June 1810, which authorised construction of locks and weirs at [[Chertsey Lock|Chertsey]], [[Shepperton Lock|Shepperton]], [[Sunbury Lock|Sunbury]] and Teddington. Each would be {{convert|150|by|20|ft|m}} with the associated weirs having ample capacity for flood conditions. Rennie, Leach and the Navigation Committee visited the sites in July, to finalise the positioning of the lock.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}  Leach then took charge of the work, which was undertaken by contractors Joseph Kimber and John Dows who also built Sunbury Lock.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jeOMfpYMOtYC&lpg=PA397 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland |editor-first=Alec W. |editor-last=Skempton |publisher=Thomas Telford, on behalf of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] |location=London |year=2002 |volume=1 |pages=14,397 |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2 |oclc=223272473}}</ref><ref name=\"Thacker1914\">{{cite book |first=Fred.

The lock was finished and opened in June 1811, but the weir was incomplete. The cofferdam protecting the works would need to be removed as river levels rose in the winter, which would have delayed completion until the following July, and so again Leach stepped in, awarding advance payments to the contractors, which enabled them to finish on time.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} The lock was further upstream than the present lock complex at the point where the footbridge now crosses.

It is noted that in 1843 the lock keeper prevented a steam vessel from ascending the lock. At that time steam vessels were limited to travel as far (upstream) as Richmond. As originally built, the lock had timber sides up to normal head water level, and turf above that. The crest of the weir was {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} above low water level at Teddington, but following the removal of the piers of old [[London Bridge]] (demolished 1831) in 1832, the drop increased to {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} and increased to {{convert|6|ft|m}} when dredging of the river was carried out.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} At tidally lower water occasional grounding of [[barges]] took place below the bottom sill.\n\nConsideration was given to removing the lock altogether in 1840.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxJAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&dq |title=Number II, The Mapledurham Scheme |journal=The Civil Engineers and Architect's Journal |date=February 1840 |volume=13 |page=66}}</ref> However, it was decided to rebuild the lock and in June 1854 proposals included providing capacity for seagoing craft with a side lock for pleasure traffic. In June 1857 the first stone of the new lock was laid at the present position, the central of the three, opened in 1858 together with the narrow [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock,{{refn|group=n|Nicknamed among lock-keepers and lock users \"the coffin\"}}. The boat slide, separate, was added in 1869 and in the 1870s the weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage. After the weir had been rebuilt in 1871, sluice bays spanned around {{convert|240|ft|m}}, similar to the tumbling bays.{{refn|group=n|The terms sluice bay and tumbling bay are two types of weir structures; the first, suspended and the second, a rising or fixed barrier.}}{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}}\n\n===Footbridges and barge lock===\nThe [[Teddington Lock Footbridges|footbridges]] were opened in 1889 and finally the barge lock, the largest lock on the river, was built in 1904\u20131905.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fred.

Parking is generally over 100&nbsp;m distant. The nearest road is Riverside Drive in Ham. Alternatively the lock can be reached from Ferry Road Teddington over the footbridges which cross the river there.\n\n==Reach above the lock==\n[[File:KingstonRiver01.JPG|thumb|left|Kingston from the river]]\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi}} above the lock is [[Trowlock Island]], towards the Teddington bank, followed by [[Steven's Eyot]] in the centre of the river. There are then [[Kingston Railway Bridge|Kingston Railway]] and [[Kingston Bridge, London|Kingston Bridges]]. After {{convert|1|mi}} the river then curves sharply to the right with [[Thames Ditton Island]] towards the village of the same name. Finally before Molesey Lock is [[Hampton Court Bridge]].\n\nDespite settlements on both sides of the lock having formed part of London since the 1960s, the banks are still often referred to as the \"Middlesex\" and \"Surrey\" banks.\n\nOn the Middlesex (Teddington etc.) side of the river going upstream, the bank generally consists of homes and gardens/communal grounds up to and inclusive of [[Hampton Wick]] at Kingston Bridge; [[Teddington Studios]], [[Lensbury]] Club, watersports clubs/a football club and the nature reserve at Trowlock are on the stretch. Above Kingston Bridge is [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court Park]], which stretches as far as Hampton Court Bridge. Half the [[Longford River]], which feeds the water-features of Hampton Court Palace, runs out of a grated culvert opposite Raven's Ait and below the Water Gallery. After Hampton Court Bridge (along the side of the weir stream) the bank adopts food/hotel use then residential use.\n[[File:TeddLockReach01.JPG|left|thumb|Scullers, [[Thames skiff|skiff]]s and [[Thames A Class Rater (scow)|Thames Raters]] at Raven's Ait on one of the most active stretches of the river]]\n\nOn the Surrey side is a consistent [[buffer zone|green buffer]] and towpath between the river and [[Ham, London|Ham]]/[[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], widening to [[Canbury Gardens]], until the high-rise town centre is reached. The town's buildings switch to entertainment immediately south of Kingston Bridge. After the canalised mouth of the [[Hogsmill River|Hogsmill]] the riverside switches to a promenade with road by residential uses until [[Seething Wells]] reservoirs. [[Raven's Ait]] is upstream of the bridges in the centre of the river at [[Surbiton]], followed by a marina. [[Thames Ditton|Long and Thames Dittons]]'s riverside homes and pubs follow until beyond Thames Ditton Island.  A riverside park and playing fields flank the mouth of the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] until Hampton Court Bridge, near to the top of the reach, overlooking part of the Palace. [[Hampton Court railway station]] is before the bridge and just above it is [[Molesey Lock]].\n\n===Boats===\nThere are [[navigation transit markers]] between Kingston Bridge and Raven's Ait on the Hampton Court bank, to allow river users to check their speed. A powered boat may not pass except in emergencies between the markers in less than one minute.  The reach is home to at least five [[sailing]] clubs, five [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs, two [[skiffing]] and punting clubs, the [[Royal Canoe Club]] and two [[Sea Cadet]] centres. Numerous pleasure boats ply for trade, London Riverboat services and chartered trips between Kingston and Hampton Court.\n\n===Thames Path===\nThe [[Thames Path]] as its towpath follows the Surrey side to Kingston Bridge where it crosses to run alongside Hampton Court Park, before returning to what is traditionally (and in navigation use) termed the \"Surrey side\" at Hampton Court Bridge.\n\n===Sinuosity===\nThe river makes an acute inside angle on this reach \u2014 the two locks are less than half the distance apart by land.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sports clubs on the reach===\n[[File:TeddSkiffLock.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The skiff lock at Teddington]]\n* [[Royal Canoe Club]]\n* [[Kingston Rowing Club]] [[File:Lady Margaret Rowing Blade.svg|50px|]]\n* [[Walbrook Rowing Club]] [[File:Walbrook Rowing Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* [[Tiffin School Boat Club]] [[File:Tiffin School Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px|]]\n* Kingston Grammar School Boat Club [[File:Kingston Grammar School Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* Kingston University Boat Club [[File:Kingston University Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* [[The Skiff Club]] [[File:BladeSC.jpg|60px]]\n* [[Dittons Skiff and Punting Club]] [[File:BladeDSPC.JPG|60px]]\n* [[Thames Sailing Club]]\n* Tamesis Sailing Club\n* Minima Yacht Club\n* [[Kingston Royals Dragon Boat Racing Club]]\n* 1st Surbiton (Sealion) Sea Scouts\n* Ajax Sea Scouts\n* Leander Sea Scouts\n\n==Popular culture and the media==\n\nThe lock was the location of the [[Monty Python]] [[The Fish-Slapping Dance|Fish-Slapping Dance]] sketch.\n\nIn episode 1 of series 5 of the BBC TV police drama ''[[New Tricks]]'', the villain is arrested at Teddington Lock.\n\n[[Thames Television]] had purpose-built studios at Teddington Lock.\n\nIn a Third Season Episode of \"Murder Maps\", Teddington Lock was the location of the brutal murder of two teenage girls in the summer of 1953.

The upper island is traversed by and accessible by the [[lock (water navigation)|lock gate]]s or [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==Location and design==\nThe greater lock is against the general south (right, towpath or Surrey) bank of the river which is for 500&nbsp;m north-east here{{refn|group=n|As the south bank is north-east or north, as beside the commercial district [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] which is centred {{convert|2.2|mi}} north, the Thames at Teddington Lock flows westward against its strongly eastward general flow; downstream of [[Oxfordshire]] other such circuitous [[meander]]s are at [[Wargrave]], for a few metres in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and at the [[Greenwich Peninsula]]}}; a middle lock being that most regularly used spans a long thin island which has lawns, places for boat owners to sit and a lock keeper's cabin and short thin island which is a thin wedge of concrete and a broad canoe/kayak stepped portage facility.\n\nThe river downstream of the lock is the Richmond and Twickenham reach of the [[Tideway]], a {{convert|3.2|mi|adj=on}} reach of semi-[[tide|tidal]] river due to the fact the [[Richmond Lock and Footbridge|Richmond Lock and half-tide barrages]] limits the fall of water thereby maintaining a head of water to aid navigability at and around low tide.{{refn|group=n|See [[tidal barrage]].}}\n\nThough the weir at '''Teddington Weir''' marks the managed river's usual [[tidal limit]], after prolonged rainfall causing very high fluvial flow, specifically at high tide, a higher limit of [[slack water|slack water (stand of the tide)]] causes [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] to arise as far upstream as [[East Molesey|the top of this reach]], the [[Molesey Lock|next lock]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26133660 |title=How does the Thames Barrier stop London flooding? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2014 |access-date= 26 March 2019|first=Tom |last=de Castella}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6080&p=0 |title=Operation of the Thames Barrier |publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe large, bow-shaped '''Teddington Weir''' is against the opposite bank. A series of two footbridges at differing heights make up a structure which crosses the locks, the middle island that has the lock keeper's cabin and the weir pool, [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==History==\n===First lock, 1810===\nThe [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]] obtained in April 1771 by the Thames Navigation Commission did not allow them to build locks below [[Maidenhead Bridge]],{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=153}} but from 1802, several plans for locks in the First District of the Thames, stretching from Staines to Teddington, were drawn up. Stephen Leach took over the post of Clerk of Works for the First District in 1802, following the retirement of Charles Truss at the age of 82. Just before his retirement, Truss proposed locks at Molesey and Teddington, each having a weir with long tumbling bays, similar to modern practice. [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] had suggested a series of long cuts in 1794, and Truss adopted the same idea. Rennie and [[William Jessop]] again proposed four long cuts in 1805, each about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but the Navigation Committee were thwarted by strong opposition from landowners.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}\n\nZacchary Allnutt, by then Surveyor for the Second and Third Districts, stretching from Staines to [[Mapledurham Lock|Mapledurham]] near Reading, suggested locks at Chertsey, Sunbury and Teddington in 1805. Rennie submitted new proposals in 1809 for nine locks between Staines and Twickenham; two would be without weirs, seven would require large weirs to be built. Finally Leach drafted plans in 1810, which he suggested were \"at once practicable and expedient, the least expensive, and the most likely to pass through Parliament without opposition and yet calculated to remedy the most prominent evils complained of.\" An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained by the [[City of London Corporation]] in June 1810, which authorised construction of locks and weirs at [[Chertsey Lock|Chertsey]], [[Shepperton Lock|Shepperton]], [[Sunbury Lock|Sunbury]] and Teddington. Each would be {{convert|150|by|20|ft|m}} with the associated weirs having ample capacity for flood conditions. Rennie, Leach and the Navigation Committee visited the sites in July, to finalise the positioning of the lock.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}  Leach then took charge of the work, which was undertaken by contractors Joseph Kimber and John Dows who also built Sunbury Lock.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jeOMfpYMOtYC&lpg=PA397 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland |editor-first=Alec W. |editor-last=Skempton |publisher=Thomas Telford, on behalf of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] |location=London |year=2002 |volume=1 |pages=14,397 |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2 |oclc=223272473}}</ref><ref name=\"Thacker1914\">{{cite book |first=Fred.

The lock was finished and opened in June 1811, but the weir was incomplete. The cofferdam protecting the works would need to be removed as river levels rose in the winter, which would have delayed completion until the following July, and so again Leach stepped in, awarding advance payments to the contractors, which enabled them to finish on time.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} The lock was further upstream than the present lock complex at the point where the footbridge now crosses.

It is noted that in 1843 the lock keeper prevented a steam vessel from ascending the lock. At that time steam vessels were limited to travel as far (upstream) as Richmond. As originally built, the lock had timber sides up to normal head water level, and turf above that. The crest of the weir was {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} above low water level at Teddington, but following the removal of the piers of old [[London Bridge]] (demolished 1831) in 1832, the drop increased to {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} and increased to {{convert|6|ft|m}} when dredging of the river was carried out.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} At tidally lower water occasional grounding of [[barges]] took place below the bottom sill.\n\nConsideration was given to removing the lock altogether in 1840.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxJAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&dq |title=Number II, The Mapledurham Scheme |journal=The Civil Engineers and Architect's Journal |date=February 1840 |volume=13 |page=66}}</ref> However, it was decided to rebuild the lock and in June 1854 proposals included providing capacity for seagoing craft with a side lock for pleasure traffic. In June 1857 the first stone of the new lock was laid at the present position, the central of the three, opened in 1858 together with the narrow [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock,{{refn|group=n|Nicknamed among lock-keepers and lock users \"the coffin\"}}. The boat slide, separate, was added in 1869 and in the 1870s the weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage.

Parking is generally over 100&nbsp;m distant. The nearest road is Riverside Drive in Ham. Alternatively the lock can be reached from Ferry Road Teddington over the footbridges which cross the river there.\n\n==Reach above the lock==\n[[File:KingstonRiver01.JPG|thumb|left|Kingston from the river]]\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi}} above the lock is [[Trowlock Island]], towards the Teddington bank, followed by [[Steven's Eyot]] in the centre of the river. There are then [[Kingston Railway Bridge|Kingston Railway]] and [[Kingston Bridge, London|Kingston Bridges]]. After {{convert|1|mi}} the river then curves sharply to the right with [[Thames Ditton Island]] towards the village of the same name. Finally before Molesey Lock is [[Hampton Court Bridge]].\n\nDespite settlements on both sides of the lock having formed part of London since the 1960s, the banks are still often referred to as the \"Middlesex\" and \"Surrey\" banks.\n\nOn the Middlesex (Teddington etc.) side of the river going upstream, the bank generally consists of homes and gardens/communal grounds up to and inclusive of [[Hampton Wick]] at Kingston Bridge; [[Teddington Studios]], [[Lensbury]] Club, watersports clubs/a football club and the nature reserve at Trowlock are on the stretch. Above Kingston Bridge is [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court Park]], which stretches as far as Hampton Court Bridge. Half the [[Longford River]], which feeds the water-features of Hampton Court Palace, runs out of a grated culvert opposite Raven's Ait and below the Water Gallery. After Hampton Court Bridge (along the side of the weir stream) the bank adopts food/hotel use then residential use.\n[[File:TeddLockReach01.JPG|left|thumb|Scullers, [[Thames skiff|skiff]]s and [[Thames A Class Rater (scow)|Thames Raters]] at Raven's Ait on one of the most active stretches of the river]]\n\nOn the Surrey side is a consistent [[buffer zone|green buffer]] and towpath between the river and [[Ham, London|Ham]]/[[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], widening to [[Canbury Gardens]], until the high-rise town centre is reached. The town's buildings switch to entertainment immediately south of Kingston Bridge. After the canalised mouth of the [[Hogsmill River|Hogsmill]] the riverside switches to a promenade with road by residential uses until [[Seething Wells]] reservoirs. [[Raven's Ait]] is upstream of the bridges in the centre of the river at [[Surbiton]], followed by a marina. [[Thames Ditton|Long and Thames Dittons]]'s riverside homes and pubs follow until beyond Thames Ditton Island.  A riverside park and playing fields flank the mouth of the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] until Hampton Court Bridge, near to the top of the reach, overlooking part of the Palace. [[Hampton Court railway station]] is before the bridge and just above it is [[Molesey Lock]].\n\n===Boats===\nThere are [[navigation transit markers]] between Kingston Bridge and Raven's Ait on the Hampton Court bank, to allow river users to check their speed. A powered boat may not pass except in emergencies between the markers in less than one minute.  The reach is home to at least five [[sailing]] clubs, five [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs, two [[skiffing]] and punting clubs, the [[Royal Canoe Club]] and two [[Sea Cadet]] centres. Numerous pleasure boats ply for trade, London Riverboat services and chartered trips between Kingston and Hampton Court.\n\n===Thames Path===\nThe [[Thames Path]] as its towpath follows the Surrey side to Kingston Bridge where it crosses to run alongside Hampton Court Park, before returning to what is traditionally (and in navigation use) termed the \"Surrey side\" at Hampton Court Bridge.\n\n===Sinuosity===\nThe river makes an acute inside angle on this reach \u2014 the two locks are less than half the distance apart by land.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sports clubs on the reach===\n[[File:TeddSkiffLock.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The skiff lock at Teddington]]\n* [[Royal Canoe Club]]\n* [[Kingston Rowing Club]] [[File:Lady Margaret Rowing Blade.svg|50px|]]\n* [[Walbrook Rowing Club]] [[File:Walbrook Rowing Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* [[Tiffin School Boat Club]] [[File:Tiffin School Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px|]]\n* Kingston Grammar School Boat Club [[File:Kingston Grammar School Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* Kingston University Boat Club [[File:Kingston University Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* [[The Skiff Club]] [[File:BladeSC.jpg|60px]]\n* [[Dittons Skiff and Punting Club]] [[File:BladeDSPC.JPG|60px]]\n* [[Thames Sailing Club]]\n* Tamesis Sailing Club\n* Minima Yacht Club\n* [[Kingston Royals Dragon Boat Racing Club]]\n* 1st Surbiton (Sealion) Sea Scouts\n* Ajax Sea Scouts\n* Leander Sea Scouts\n\n==Popular culture and the media==\n\nThe lock was the location of the [[Monty Python]] [[The Fish-Slapping Dance|Fish-Slapping Dance]] sketch.\n\nIn episode 1 of series 5 of the BBC TV police drama ''[[New Tricks]]'', the villain is arrested at Teddington Lock.\n\n[[Thames Television]] had purpose-built studios at Teddington Lock.\n\nIn a Third Season Episode of \"Murder Maps\", Teddington Lock was the location of the brutal murder of two teenage girls in the summer of 1953.
