Test subjects all had type 1 diabetes and were randomized to a tight glycemic arm and a control arm with the standard of care at the time; people were followed for an average of seven years, and people in the treatment had dramatically lower rates of diabetic complications.  It was as a landmark study at the time, and significantly changed the management of all forms of diabetes.<ref name=Pozzilli2014/><ref>{{cite journal |title=American Diabetes Association Statement: Implications of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial |journal=Diabetes Care |date=1 January 2003 |volume=26 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S25\u2013S27 |doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2007.S25|pmid=12502616 |author1=American Diabetes Association }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\n|author1=The Diabetes Control |author2=Complications Trial Research Group. |journal=N Engl J Med\n|pmid=8366922|doi=10.1056/NEJM199309303291401|year=1993|volume=329|pages=977\u201386|issue=14}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a clinical study conducted by Z that was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1998.
