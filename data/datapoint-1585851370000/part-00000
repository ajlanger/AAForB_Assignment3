Two spiritual religious institutions, suggested by the [[Council of Trent]] were formed: the ''Schola del Santissimo Sacramento'' and the ''Schola della Dottrina cristiana''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1= Tribuzio Zotti|first1= Luciana|last2= Magni|first2= Giuseppe|title = Brugherio: una citt\u00e0 nel segno dei Magi|pages = 38\u201339}}</ref> The first of these was founded in 1578 and it was created to encourage the congregation to get involved in partivular devotional practices. The ''Schola della Dottrina cristiana'' on the other hand was to instruct the faithful in matters of faith and remove them from [[heresy]]. The Church's most notable event during this time, however, was to be the Papal recognition of the church's relics of the three Magi. The major part of these relics were transferred in [[Cologne]] by Federico Borromeo in 1613.
