Concrete blocks may be produced with hollow centers (cores) to reduce [[weight]] or improve [[building insulation|insulation]].  Blocks come in modular sizes, with the most popular typically referred to (by their thickness) as \"4-inch\", \"6-inch\", \"8-inch\", and \"12-inch\". In the US, CMU blocks are nominally {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide.  Their actual dimensions are {{convert|3/8|in}} less than the nominal dimensions (to allow for {{frac|3|8}}-inch mortar joints between blocks in any orientation).<ref>[https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/masonry/concblocksizes.html The Architect's Toolbox]</ref> In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually {{convert|440|x|215|x|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} excluding mortar joints. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually {{convert|390|x|190|x|190|mm|in|abbr=on}} excluding mortar joints.\n\nBlock cores are typically tapered so that their top surface (as laid) has a greater surface on which to spread a mortar bed and for easier handling. Most CMU's have two cores, but three- and four-core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of [[rebar|steel reinforcement]] to span courses in order to increase [[tensile strength]].  This is accomplished by [[grout]]ing the voids of blocks containing rebar with concrete. Thus reinforced, CMU walls are better able to resist lateral forces such as [[wind load]] and seismic forces.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=61\u201363}}\n\nA variety of specialized shapes exist to allow special construction features.  U-shaped blocks or knockout blocks with notches to allow the construction of [[bond beam]]s or [[lintel]] assemblies, using horizontal reinforcing grouted into place in the cavity. Blocks with a channel on the end, known as \"jamb blocks\", allow doors to be secured to wall assemblies. Blocks with grooved ends permit the construction of [[Expansion joint|control joints]], allowing a filler material to be anchored between the un-mortared block ends. Other features, such as radiused corners known as \"[[bullnose]]s\" may be incorporated. A wide variety of decorative profiles also exist.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=66-68}}\n\nConcrete masonry units may be formulated with special aggregates to produce specific colors or textures for finish use. Special textures may be produced by splitting a ribbed or solid two-block unit; such factory-produced units are called \"split-rib\" or \"split-face\" blocks.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=68-70}} Blocks may be scored by grooves the width of a mortar joint to simulate different block modules. For example, an {{convert|8|by(x)|16|in|adj=on}} block may be scored in the middle to simulate {{convert|8|by(x)|8|in|adj=on}} masonry, with the grooves filled with mortar and struck to match the true joints.<ref name=ching1>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis D.K.|title=A Visual Dictionary of Architecture|year=2012|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]], Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-64885-8|edition=2nd|page=168}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===Uses===\nConcrete block, when built with integral steel reinforcing or in tandem with [[Reinforced concrete#Use in construction|concrete columns and tie beams]] and [[Rebar#Use in concrete and masonry|reinforced with rebar]], is a very common building material for the [[load-bearing wall]]s of buildings, in what is termed '''concrete block structure''' ('''CBS''') construction. American [[suburban]] [[houses]] typically employ a concrete [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] and slab with a concrete block wall on the perimeter. Other common uses for concrete block wall is interior fire-rated partition walls, and exterior backup wall for attachment of building envelope systems and fa\u00e7ades.\n\n===Structural properties===\nConcrete masonry walls may be ungrouted, partially [[grout]]ed, or fully grouted, the latter two enhancing their structural strength. Additionally, steel reinforcement bars ([[rebar]])  can be used both vertically and horizontally inside a CMU wall to maximize its structural performance. The cells in which the rebar is placed must be grouted for the bars to bond to the wall. For this reason, high seismic zones typically only allow fully grouted walls in their building codes. The American design code that guides design engineers in using CMU as a structural system is the ''Masonry Standards Joint Committee's Building Code Requirements & Specification for Masonry Structures'' (TMS 402/ACI 530/ASCE 5). The compressive strength of concrete masonry units and masonry walls varies from approximately {{convert|1000|psi|MPa|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5000|psi|MPa|0|abbr=on}} based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit, stacking orientation, the type of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] used to build the wall, and other factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cement.org/pdf_files/IS276.pdf|title=Compressive Strength of Masonry |publisher=Portland Cement Organization |format=PDF |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc26362/nrcc26362.pdf |title=Comprehensive Strength of Hollow Concrete Blockwork |format=PDF |publisher=Government of Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916124303/http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc26362/nrcc26362.pdf |date=4 June 1986 |archivedate=2017-06-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/reference/Henley-s-20th-Century-Formulas-Recipes-Processes-Vol3/Properties-of-Concrete-Blocks-8212-Strength.html|title=Properties of Concrete Blocks \u2014 Strength|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Brick#Concrete bricks|Concrete bricks]]\n* [[Gypsum block]]\n* [[Rusticated concrete block]]\n*[[Fly ash brick]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Beall|first=Christine|title=Masonry Design and Detailing for Architects, Engineers and Builders|year=1987|location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|isbn=0-07-004223-3|pages=61\u201363 |ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Concrete blocks}}\n* [http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Concrete-Block.html How Products Are Made: Volume 3 Concrete Block]\n* [http://www.cmacn.org Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada]\n* [http://www.ncma.org National Concrete Masonry Association]\n* [http://www.masoncontractors.org/ Mason Contractors Association of America]\n* [http://www.cba-blocks.org.uk/ Concrete Block Association]\n* [http://www.masonryinstitute.org/ Masonry Institute of America]\n* [http://classicrockfaceblock.com/the-history-behind-rock-face-block/ \"The History Behind Rock Face Block\"]\u2014Classic Rock Face Block\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Soil-based building materials]]\n", "text_old": "{{selfref|\"Cinderblock\" redirects here.
