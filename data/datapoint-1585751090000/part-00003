He rode from 1952 to 1968, winning 105 races as a professional. He won the national road championship four times - 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964. He was also world road champion in 1962, and won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in 1958.\n\n==Biography==\nJean Stablinski was the son of Polish immigrants in the mining area of the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] department of France. His father died in a work accident in 1946 and Jean, at 14, started working in the mine to provide income for his family. It was at this time that he won a bicycle in an accordion competition. Legend says that his mother was so displeased by her son's new hobby that she damaged his bike.\n\nJean, still known as Stablewski, became naturalised as French at 16 and rode his first races. It was while riding the [[Peace Race]] that a journalist's error in writing his name 'Stablinski' created the surname by which he became known.\n\n==Professional career==\nStablinski turned professional at 21. From 1958 until 1967 he rode in the same teams as [[Jacques Anquetil]], always as a support rider, or domestique. Stablinski won the national road championship four times and came second twice, all within six years, an achievement no rider has matched.\n\nStablinski stayed with Anquetil until his team-mate wrote a series of newspaper articles, one of which Stablinski believed criticised him even though he had devoted his career to Anquetil. The two rarely spoke after that and Stablinski joined the team headed by Anquetil's biggest rival, [[Raymond Poulidor]].\n\nStablinski was recognised as a rider who made up for physical limitations by his tactical sense and his chance to profit from the moment. His knack, riders recognised, was to recognise which breakaway attempt would count and not to waste effort on the others.\n\nStablinski was twice suspended for doping.\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:Jean STABLINSKI.jpg|thumb|Stablinski in 1997]]\nStablinski retired from racing and was for six years manager of the Sonolor-Lejeune, signing [[Lucien Van Impe]] and [[Bernard Hinault]] as young unknowns. His son, Jacques Stablinski, born 1956, also became a professional cyclist and rode for [[Gitane-Campagnolo]]. He became known as \"Petit Stab\" but never had his father's talent.\n\nJean Stablinski never stopped riding a bike until the illness that led to his death. He said he never put a drinks bottle on his bike when he rode for pleasure. He had spent too many years racing as a professional with no chance to stop and look around or to meet people, he told the historian Jean-Paul Ollivier on French television. If he had no water on his bike but a few euros in his pocket, he could stop and buy a drink at any bar he fancied and get into conversation with whomever he met.\n\nHe became a member of [[Paris\u2013Roubaix#Les Amis de Paris\u2013Roubaix|Les Amis de Paris\u2013Roubaix]], enthusiasts and workers for the spring classic. It was Stablinski who suggested the cobbled path through the Arenberg forest. His qualifications were impeccable: as a miner he had worked beneath the road and as a cyclist he had ridden along it.\n\nHe died after a long illness. On 7 April 2008 he was remembered by a memorial beside the [[Paris\u2013Roubaix#18 - Trou\u00e9e d'Arenberg|Wallers-Arenberg]] road he had introduced to [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]]. The memorial was made in blue limestone from [[Soignies]] by the sculptor Michel Karpovitch.\n\n==Major results==\n{{div col}}\n; 1954\n: 1st [[Paris\u2013Bourges]]\n;1957\n: 1st Stage 12 [[1957 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n;1958\n: 1st [[File:Jersey yellow.svg|20px]] Overall [[1958 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n::1st Stages 5a ([[Team time trial|TTT]]) & 8\n;1960\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st Stage 13 [[1960 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]\n;1961\n: 1st Stage 7 [[1961 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n;1962\n: 1st [[File:Jersey rainbow.svg|20px]] [[1962 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|Road race]], [[1962 UCI Road World Championships|UCI Road World Championships]]\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st Stage 14 [[1962 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n: 1st Stage 11 [[1962 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n;1963\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st [[Paris\u2013Brussels]]\n: 1st Stage 10 [[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n: 1st Stage 4 [[1963 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]\n;1964\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st Stage 21 [[1964 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n;1965\n: 1st [[File:Jersey yellow.svg|20px]] Overall [[Tour of Belgium]]\n: 1st [[Rund um den Henninger-Turm]]\n: 1st [[Trofeo Baracchi]] (with [[Jacques Anquetil]])\n: 1st Stage 4 [[Grand Prix du Midi Libre]]\n;1966\n: 1st [[1966 Amstel Gold Race|Amstel Gold Race]]\n;1967\n: 1st Stage 19 [[1967 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n: 1st Stage 8 [[1967 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal| last = Judycki| first = Zbigniew| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Jean Stabli\u0144ski (1932-2007)| journal = Forum Polonijne | volume = 3 | issue = 2007 | pages = 30 | publisher = | date = | url = | doi = | issn = 1234-2807 | accessdate =  }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cycling Archives|6716}}\n*[http://histo.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/coureur/3340.html Official Tour de France results for Jean Stablinski]\n\n{{UCI Road World Champions \u2013 Men's road race}}\n{{Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a winners}}\n{{French National Road Race Championships (men) |state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stablinski, Jean}}\n[[Category:1932 births]]\n[[Category:2007 deaths]]\n[[Category:French male cyclists]]\n[[Category:French Tour de France stage winners]]\n[[Category:French people of Polish descent]]\n[[Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a winners]]\n[[Category:French Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners]]\n[[Category:French Giro d'Italia stage winners]]\n[[Category:UCI Road World Champions (elite men)]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Valenciennes]]\n[[Category:Knights of the National Order of Merit (France)]]\n[[Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists]]\n[[Category:Tour de France cyclists]]\n[[Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Infobox cyclist\n| name           = Jean Stablinski\n| image          = Jean Stablinski 1963.jpg\n| caption        = Stablinski at the [[1963 Tour de France]]\n| full_name      = Jean Stablewski\n| nickname       = \n| birth_date     = {{Birth date|1932|5|21|df=y}}\n| birth_place    = [[Thun-Saint-Amand]], France\n| death_date     = {{death date and age|2007|7|22|1932|5|21|df=y}}\n| death_place    = \n| height         = \n| weight         = \n| currentteam    = \n| discipline     = Road\n| role           = Rider\n| ridertype      = \n| amateuryears1  = \n| amateurteam1   = \n| proyears1     = 1952-1955\n| proteam1      = Gitane\u2013Hutchinson\n| proyears2     = 1956-1958\n| proteam2      = Essor\u2013Leroux\n| proyears3     = 1959-1961\n| proteam3      = {{ct|Helyett|1959}}\n| proyears4     = 1962\u20131964\n| proteam4      = {{ct|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl|1962}}\n| proyears5     = 1965\u20131966\n| proteam5      = {{ct|Ford France|1965}}\n| proyears6     = 1967\n| proteam6      = {{ct|Bic|1967}}\n| proyears7     = 1968\n| proteam7      = {{ct|Mercier|1968}}\n| majorwins      = World road race champion (1962)<br/>Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a (1958) <br/>Paris-Brussels (1963) <br/> GP Frankfurt (1965)<br/>Amstel Gold Race (1966)\n| show-medals = yes\n| medaltemplates = \n{{MedalSport| Men's [[road bicycle racing]] }}\n{{MedalCountry| {{FRA}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[UCI Road World Championships|World Championships]]}}\n{{MedalGold |[[1962 UCI Road World Championships|1962 Sal\u00f2 di Garda]]|Elite Men's Road Race}}\n}}\n\n'''Jean Stablewski''' (21 May 1932, [[Thun-Saint-Amand]] &ndash;
