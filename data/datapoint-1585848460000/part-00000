However, Siljander is attributed to having proposed the ultimate solution of a hybrid [[African Union]] and United Nations ([[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]) peacekeeping force. Siljander then worked with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769]] which was accepted by Sudan, and helped to end the genocide. \n\nSudanese Foreign Minister [[Ali Ahmed Karti|Ali Karti]], in a video testimony,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trac5.org/secret-darfur-solution-revealed/|title=Ali Karti on Darfur|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> stated:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The [Darfur] solution came from this very humble man...the solution came from [Siljander].\"|author=Ali Karti|title=Foreign Minister of Sudan|source=}}\n\n[[Andrew Natsios]], the U.S. [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] to Sudan, in a publicly available letter<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bridgestocommonground.org/accomplishments/|title=Reference Darfur track-record|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to Siljander dated October 21, 2007 is quoted as saying: \n\n{{Quote|text=\"...as a Christian layman interested in peace and reconciliation.

Accessed August 31, 2011.]</ref> The basis for these charges was Siljander's non-profit receipt of a $50,000 donation from the [[Islamic American Relief Agency]] (\"IARA\") which, at the time, was still in good standing with the IRS and not yet designated on [[Office of Foreign Assets Control|OFAC]]'s [[Specially Designated Global Terrorist|SDGT]] list. It was later discovered that IARA violated U.S. sanctions by sending money to Iraq, purportedly as part of their charitable operations.\n\nSiljander asserted to investigators that this contribution was used to support his own non-profit research and to help publish his then upcoming book on the subject of Muslim-Christian relations. Siljander further asserted that he, instead of lobbying, referred [[Robert P. Hanrahan]], a registered lobbyist who did in fact legally represent IARA, a claim which is supported by Robert Hanrahan's affidavit and DOJ records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/file/877561/download|title=Affiliated Plea Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, the government claimed that this was not a legitimate donation, implying that Siljander had instead used the funds as a [[quid pro quo]] to lobby for the U.S. based charity. \n\nOn January 12, 2012, Siljander was sentenced to a year and a day in prison which, with good behavior, effectively equates to four to five months of actual time served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/01/former_michigan_congressman_ma.html,|title=Former Michigan congressman Mark Siljander sentenced to year in federal prison|publisher=}}</ref> He turned himself in on March 10, 2012 to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg]]. Despite his short sentence and the nature of his charges, Siljander was originally assigned to the medium security prison, not a camp. He was soon transferred to the low security facility which typically housed violent offenders and pedophiles with a 10-year sentence or less remaining to be served. \n\nWeeks before his scheduled release, Siljander was diagnosed with a rare terminal cancer called [[Malignant rhabdoid tumour|Rhabdoid Sarcoma]] and was expected to die in three months or less. Having no health insurance and prior to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] passage, Siljander voluntarily doubled his prison sentence and was transferred to the maximum security facility at [[Federal Medical Center, Butner]]. After a round surgery and radiation, Siljander was released from prison on December 20, 2012 to be reunited with his family for the holidays. He has been cancer-free for 7 years, and according to doctors at [[Duke University Hospital]] and consulting doctors at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|John's Hopkins Hospital]], Siljander may be one of the only adults to survive this rare form of cancer.\n\n===False claims===\n\nThe language used by federal prosecutors in the press conference announcing Siljander's indictment prompted global headlines<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/16/exlawmaker-charged-in-ter_n_81842.html, \"Ex-Lawmaker Charged in Terror Conspiracy\"</ref><ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323250,00.html, \"Ex-Congressman, U.N.

Clarifying the record, however, the presiding Judge Nanette Laughrey is quoted during sentencing saying: \"But the truth is, when you look at this objectively, this is not a case about [Siljander] aiding a terrorist, it just isn't...\"<ref>\"Transcript of Sentencing Proceedings\" No. 07-00087-07-CR-W-NKL, January 11, 2012 reference line 20-22 on page 36 of the transcript. </ref>\n\nAlso, under the government's own headline, \"Terrorism and National Security\", the Justice Department included the Siljander guilty plea as one of their two announced successes against terrorism. The inflammatory and misleading January 2008 press conference provoked a firestorm of fallacious media reporting that continued through 2013.<ref>http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/criminal-division/terrorism-and-national-security, \"Terrorism and National Security: Recent Significant Cases\"</ref>\n\nThe day following the initial press conference, the Justice Department's Press Release corrected the \"terrorism\" statements by stating, \"It is important to note that the indictment does not charge any of the defendants with material support of terrorism, nor does it allege that they knowingly financed acts of terror.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2008/January/08_nsd_029.html|title=#08-029: 01-16-08 Islamic Charity Charged with Terrorist Financing; Former U.S. Congressman Indicted for Money Laundering|website=www.justice.gov}}</ref>  It went largely unreported. \n\n===Response from Siljander===\n\nUpon his release from prison, Siljander publicly protested his innocence, and claimed that two Muslim co-defendants (whom he had never met nor spoken with) had been induced to give false testimony against him in exchange for immunity from prosecution.\n\nSiljander's open letter to his newsletter subscribers was quoted in full in several venues, and contains the following narrative: \n\n{{quote|Throughout my 15 years in various levels of government, I tried to make the world safer by political means. This failed. However, these experiences led me to revelations that address the needs of a dominant issue in our time\u2014bridging the growing divide among Christians, Muslims & Jews. Over time this work produced a model for peacemaking and problem solving in complex crises in places like Iraq, Libya and Sudan. These efforts gained traction for peacemaking with U.S. & world leaders; while my controversial book on the subject, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding'', was being readied for a major release. My approach required working with both friends and enemies of our country.\n\nTo support this exciting peace and faith bridging work, we raised funds for travel, research and writing. One donor, a 25-year-old U.S. based, government approved Muslim charity, was recommended by one of my Muslim associates in the work. The charity's principals were later indicted on grounds of supporting terrorists and misappropriating [U.S.] government grant funds. Those opposed to my [peacemaking] work seized this opportunity to discredit me by insisting I testify against the charity. I refused to give a false testimony and was consequently indicted on outlandish charges of money laundering & conspiracy. This exploded into a media frenzy tying me with terror funding, even though the judge reminded prosecutors that the case had nothing to do with terrorism or national security. After four years of exaggerated accusations, all major charges were dropped, leaving only obstruction of justice for claiming to the FBI that I had not lobbied for the Muslim charity and [for] not registering as a lobbyist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085238/http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|url-status=live|archive-date=2013-11-05|title=Siljander declares his innocence}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last= Siljander |first= Mark D. |title= A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide |publisher= [[HarperOne]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |date=October 2008 |isbn= 978-0-06-143828-8 }}<ref name=\"nautilusbookawards.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|title=2009 NAUTILUS BOOK AWARDS SILVER WINNERS|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517014226/http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|archivedate=May 17, 2009|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n* Belz, Emily. \"Bad Connections\".

Many of these discoveries are outlined in Siljander's book, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide'' which was endorsed by a diverse group of scholars including Dr. [[Sidney H.

This relationship and prayer partnership between Siljander and Bashir continued as the [[War in Darfur]] began emerging. During one of their many meetings, President Bashir is reported to have asked Siljander, \"What should I do about Darfur?\" Bashir had previously declared he would not allow [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN Peacekeepers]] to be deployed in Darfur and rejected the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706]]. However, Siljander is attributed to having proposed the ultimate solution of a hybrid [[African Union]] and United Nations ([[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]) peacekeeping force. Siljander then worked with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769]] which was accepted by Sudan, and helped to end the genocide. \n\nSudanese Foreign Minister [[Ali Ahmed Karti|Ali Karti]], in a video testimony,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trac5.org/secret-darfur-solution-revealed/|title=Ali Karti on Darfur|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> stated:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The [Darfur] solution came from this very humble man...the solution came from [Siljander].\"|author=Ali Karti|title=Foreign Minister of Sudan|source=}}\n\n[[Andrew Natsios]], the U.S. [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] to Sudan, in a publicly available letter<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bridgestocommonground.org/accomplishments/|title=Reference Darfur track-record|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to Siljander dated October 21, 2007 is quoted as saying: \n\n{{Quote|text=\"...as a Christian layman interested in peace and reconciliation.

Hanrahan]], a registered lobbyist who did in fact legally represent IARA, a claim which is supported by Robert Hanrahan's affidavit and DOJ records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/file/877561/download|title=Affiliated Plea Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, the government claimed that this was not a legitimate donation, implying that Siljander had instead used the funds as a [[quid pro quo]] to lobby for the U.S. based charity. \n\nOn January 12, 2012, Siljander was sentenced to a year and a day in prison which, with good behavior, effectively equates to four to five months of actual time served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/01/former_michigan_congressman_ma.html,|title=Former Michigan congressman Mark Siljander sentenced to year in federal prison|publisher=}}</ref> He turned himself in on March 10, 2012 to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg]]. Despite his short sentence and the nature of his charges, Siljander was originally assigned to the medium security prison, not a camp. He was soon transferred to the low security facility which typically housed violent offenders and pedophiles with a 10-year sentence or less remaining to be served. \n\nWeeks before his scheduled release, Siljander was diagnosed with a rare terminal cancer called [[Malignant rhabdoid tumour|Rhabdoid Sarcoma]] and was expected to die in three months or less. Having no health insurance and prior to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] passage, Siljander voluntarily doubled his prison sentence and was transferred to the maximum security facility at [[Federal Medical Center, Butner]]. After a round surgery and radiation, Siljander was released from prison on December 20, 2012 to be reunited with his family for the holidays. He has been cancer-free for 7 years, and according to doctors at [[Duke University Hospital]] and consulting doctors at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|John's Hopkins Hospital]], Siljander may be one of the only adults to survive this rare form of cancer.\n\n===False claims===\n\nThe language used by federal prosecutors in the press conference announcing Siljander's indictment prompted global headlines<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/16/exlawmaker-charged-in-ter_n_81842.html, \"Ex-Lawmaker Charged in Terror Conspiracy\"</ref><ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323250,00.html, \"Ex-Congressman, U.N. Delegate Indicted as Part of Terrorist Fundraising Ring\"</ref><ref>https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/01/ex-congressmen/, \"Ex-Congressmen Indicted as Jihadist Money Man\"</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7193038.stm, \"US politician on al-Qaeda charge: A former US congressman has been charged with helping to fund 'a key al-Qaeda supporter' in Afghanistan\"</ref> which mischaracterised Siljander as having associations to terrorism and terror funding. Clarifying the record, however, the presiding Judge Nanette Laughrey is quoted during sentencing saying: \"But the truth is, when you look at this objectively, this is not a case about [Siljander] aiding a terrorist, it just isn't...\"<ref>\"Transcript of Sentencing Proceedings\" No. 07-00087-07-CR-W-NKL, January 11, 2012 reference line 20-22 on page 36 of the transcript. </ref>\n\nAlso, under the government's own headline, \"Terrorism and National Security\", the Justice Department included the Siljander guilty plea as one of their two announced successes against terrorism. The inflammatory and misleading January 2008 press conference provoked a firestorm of fallacious media reporting that continued through 2013.<ref>http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/criminal-division/terrorism-and-national-security, \"Terrorism and National Security: Recent Significant Cases\"</ref>\n\nThe day following the initial press conference, the Justice Department's Press Release corrected the \"terrorism\" statements by stating, \"It is important to note that the indictment does not charge any of the defendants with material support of terrorism, nor does it allege that they knowingly financed acts of terror.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2008/January/08_nsd_029.html|title=#08-029: 01-16-08 Islamic Charity Charged with Terrorist Financing; Former U.S. Congressman Indicted for Money Laundering|website=www.justice.gov}}</ref>  It went largely unreported. \n\n===Response from Siljander===\n\nUpon his release from prison, Siljander publicly protested his innocence, and claimed that two Muslim co-defendants (whom he had never met nor spoken with) had been induced to give false testimony against him in exchange for immunity from prosecution.\n\nSiljander's open letter to his newsletter subscribers was quoted in full in several venues, and contains the following narrative: \n\n{{quote|Throughout my 15 years in various levels of government, I tried to make the world safer by political means. This failed. However, these experiences led me to revelations that address the needs of a dominant issue in our time\u2014bridging the growing divide among Christians, Muslims & Jews. Over time this work produced a model for peacemaking and problem solving in complex crises in places like Iraq, Libya and Sudan. These efforts gained traction for peacemaking with U.S. & world leaders; while my controversial book on the subject, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding'', was being readied for a major release. My approach required working with both friends and enemies of our country.\n\nTo support this exciting peace and faith bridging work, we raised funds for travel, research and writing. One donor, a 25-year-old U.S. based, government approved Muslim charity, was recommended by one of my Muslim associates in the work. The charity's principals were later indicted on grounds of supporting terrorists and misappropriating [U.S.] government grant funds. Those opposed to my [peacemaking] work seized this opportunity to discredit me by insisting I testify against the charity. I refused to give a false testimony and was consequently indicted on outlandish charges of money laundering & conspiracy. This exploded into a media frenzy tying me with terror funding, even though the judge reminded prosecutors that the case had nothing to do with terrorism or national security. After four years of exaggerated accusations, all major charges were dropped, leaving only obstruction of justice for claiming to the FBI that I had not lobbied for the Muslim charity and [for] not registering as a lobbyist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085238/http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|url-status=live|archive-date=2013-11-05|title=Siljander declares his innocence}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last= Siljander |first= Mark D. |title= A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide |publisher= [[HarperOne]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |date=October 2008 |isbn= 978-0-06-143828-8 }}<ref name=\"nautilusbookawards.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|title=2009 NAUTILUS BOOK AWARDS SILVER WINNERS|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517014226/http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|archivedate=May 17, 2009|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n* Belz, Emily. \"Bad Connections\".
