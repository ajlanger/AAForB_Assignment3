Like his predecessors he was heavily dependent on the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and was forced to comply to Dutch demands to extirpate spice trees in his domains, ensuring Dutch monopoly of the profitable [[spice trade]]. On the other hand, the Ternate-VOC alliance led to a large increase of Ternatan territory in the war with [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar]] in 1667.\n\n==Accession==\n\nKaicili (prince) Tahubo, the later Mandar Syah, was only a few years old when his father Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] passed away in 1627. He had two older brothers, Kaicili Kalamata and Kaicili Manilha, and was therefore not a likely candidate for the Ternatan throne.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 20.</ref> An older kinsman, [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]] ruled as Sultan from 1627 to 1648 when he passed away without sons. Now the grandees of the kingdom wanted Manilha to be their new ruler, while Muslim clerics preferred Kalamata. However, the VOC, whose influence in the affairs of Ternate was on the rise, insisted that the youngest brother Tahubo should be installed since he had been raised under the supervision of the Dutch governors in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. xxxvii.</ref> The Ternatan elite was less than pleased, and so Tahubo, who took the title Sultan Mandar Syah, was even more dependent on Dutch goodwill than his two predecessors. His Dutch leanings can be seen from the names that he gave a few of his sons: Prince Amsterdam, Prince Rotterdam.\n\n==The rebellion of Manilha==\n\nDissatisfaction with Mandar Syah's dependence on the Company soon led to open opposition from the influential House of Fala Rahi and the various Bobatos (chiefs) of Ternate. In August 1650 they elected his brother Manilha, supposedly a mentally unstable person, as Sultan in opposition. They believed that Manilha would be more sensible to Ternatan community leaders. The attempt soon faltered, since the Dutch were not ready to abandon their candidate. Admiral Arnold de Vlamingh van Oudshoorn turned up in Maluku in 1651 and forced Manilha to yield. The other brother Kalamata, an able figure and an expert in Islamic law, continued to create trouble for the Dutch during the coming years and eventually fled to Ternate's political rival [[Makassar]]. Anti-Dutch opposition also spread to the Hoamoal Peninsula in West [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and the Muslim realm Hitu in [[Ambon]], both of which were formally Ternatan dependencies. Admiral de Vlamingh van Oudshoorn, enjoined by Mandar Syah, spent several years suppressing the resistance, an extremely bloody affair that finally ensured total Dutch control over the clove-producing Ambon Quarter.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 162-4. </ref> \n\n==Extirpation of clove trees==\n\nApart from the rebellions, the selling of spices to merchants operating outside the VOC was a problem for the Dutch authorities, who deemed such practices \"smuggling\". The solution was to force the periphery areas in Maluku to stop producing spices. Here Mandar Syah was a useful tool to enforce Dutch spice monopoly. A treaty with the Sultan was signed on 31 July 1652. Mandar Syah agreed to allow the destruction of all clove trees in Ternate and the Ambon dependencies. In return, the Sultan received an annual sum (''recognitiepenningen'') of 12,000 rijksdaalders. Some of this money was to be allocated to the various Bobatos. In practice, this became a way for the Sultan to keep the Bobatos in check since those showing signs of disobedience had their subsidies withdrawn. This differed from the old system where the Bobatos kept incomes from the clove trade for the needs of their own community (''soa'').<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 167-8.</ref> Similar contracts were concluded with the other sultanates [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]].<ref>F.C. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 52.</ref> The Company and the Sultans upheld the monopoly by means of regular expeditions, ''hongitochten'', that cruised the islands and destroyed any spice tree that was found. Such ''hongitochten'' were conducted until the 19th century and gained notoriety for brutality.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 171-2.</ref>\n\n==Political gains==\n\nThe rise of the Makassar Kingdom in the first half of the 17th century had grave consequences for the Sultante of Ternate. Large areas such as [[Buton]], [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]], [[Menado]], [[Sula Islands|Sula]] and [[Buru Island|Buru]] fell away from Ternatan overlordship.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 164.</ref> Here, the growing power of the VOC turned out to be advantageous. Ternate supported the [[Makassar War|VOC expedition to Makassar]] in 1667 with a small force. Makassar was crushed with the help of the [[Bugis people|Bugis]] leader [[Arung Palakka]] and forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bongaya]] in the same year. One of the stipulations was that Ternate regained its old vassals in [[Sulawesi]] and adjacent islands.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1981) ''The heritage of Arung Palakka''. The Hague: Nijhoff, p. 306.</ref> Another political rival, the [[Tidore Sultanate]], left its traditional alliance with [[Spain]] and made contracts with the VOC in 1657 and 1667, which for the moment put an end to the long history of Ternatan-Tidorese rivalries and petty wars.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe legacy of Sultan Mandar Syah was therefore ambivalent: on one hand close dependency on the VOC, but on the other hand a strengthening of the Sultan's own powers at the expense of officials and chiefs, and a dramatic increase in territory. These contradiction would lead to open anti-Dutch rebellion under his son [[Sibori Amsterdam]] who succeeded him in 1675.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 179-85.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Mandar Syah married the following wives and co-wives:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* A daughter of Sultan Saidi of [[Tidore]] (possibly merely engaged)\n* A princess of [[Buton]]\n* Maya from Ternate, mother of Boki Mahir\n* Lawa, mother of Amsterdam, Malayu, Mauludu and Sarabu\n* Maryam from Sahu, mother of Rotterdam and Boki Gogugu\n* Ainun, mother of Toloko\n* A [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]] woman, mother of Neman\n* A [[Gorontalo|Gorontalese]] woman, mother of Hukum and Diojo\n\nHis sons (Kaicili, princes) and daughters (Boki, princesses) were:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* Boki Mahir Gammalamo\n* Kaicili [[Sibori Amsterdam]], Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Malayu\n* Boki Mauludu\n* Boki Sarabu\n* Kaicili Rotterdam alias Yena\n* Boki Gogugu\n* Kaicili Toloko, Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Neman\n* Kaicili Hukum\n* Boki Diojo\n* Boki Timonga\n* Boki Tabilo\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1648\u20131675}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Sibori Amsterdam]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name  = Sultan Mandar Syah\n|succession  = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n|reign       = 1648\u20131675\n|predecessor = [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]\n|successor   = [[Sibori Amsterdam]]\n|regnal name =  \n|house       = \n|father      = [[Mudafar Syah I]]\n|mother      = \n|birth_date  = \n|birth_place = \n|death_date  = 3 January 1675\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n}}\n\n'''Sultan Mandar Syah''' (b. c. 1625-d. 3 January 1675) was the 11th Sultan of [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]] who reigned from 1648 to 1675.
