His last major appearance was when he appeared as a guest at the New Yorker Festival in 2007. Belle was interviewed for the parkour article \"No Obstacles\" written by Alec Wilkinson which was published in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_wilkinson |title=No Obstacles | publisher=newyorker.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nBelle formerly endorsed the clothing company [[Take Flight, LLC|Take Flight]], but decided to sever his ties to the brand because he disapproved of their business activities and motives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbelle.com/fr/vetements.php |title=The Website of David Belle |publisher=DavidBelle.com |accessdate=4 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426015830/http://www.davidbelle.com/fr/vetements.php |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Parkour groups===\n* [[Les Traceurs]]\n** Belle was the leader of a group called \"Les traceurs\" which also included well known practitioner [[Stephane Vigroux]]. The name has since been used to refer to those that practice parkour.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n* PAWA (former member)\n** Belle helped form the Parkour World Association, but he stopped the group for lack of cohesion.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n* [[Yamakasi]]\n** Belle was never a member of the Yamakasi group. He was a part of the group that later called themselves the Yamakasi, but the group chose the name Yamakasi during the filming of the Stade 2 news feature, credited as the first news feature about parkour. Belle was against the name and wanted to call the practice \"parkour\". He then split from the group after the feature because he felt that naming took away from the recognition of the discipline and its history.\n\n==See also==\n* [[S\u00e9bastien Foucan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb name|1042642}}\n* [http://la.ecitalent.com/biography/david-belle David Belle @ ECI Global Talent Management]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Parkour and Freerunning}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belle, David}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:French male film actors]]\n[[Category:French stunt performers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French people of Vietnamese descent]]\n[[Category:Parkour]]\n[[Category:Traceurs]]\n[[Category:People from F\u00e9camp]]\n", "name_user": "14.232.203.56", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Th\u00eam n\u1ed9i dung: sinh ra t\u1ea1i Vietnam)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Belle"}
