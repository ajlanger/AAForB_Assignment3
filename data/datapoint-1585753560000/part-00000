It is intermediate in size between the smaller wood stork and the larger jabiru, the two other stork species with which the maguari stork exists in [[sympatry]] in some parts of its range.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Much of the adult [[plumage]] is white, with black [[flight feather]]s and a forked blacked tail. This forked tail is shorter than the stiff white undertail coverts, so that these protrude from underneath the tail and may function aerodynamically in flight.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The forked tail clearly distinguishes the maguari stork from the white stork,<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/>  and is easily seen in flight through the white undertail coverts by an observer from the ground.<ref name=\"Wetmore\">Wetmore A. 1926.

Dent and Sons Ltd., New York.</ref>\n\nIndividuals undergo a fresh [[moult]] in the breeding season to produce brighter [[plumage]] in preparation for [[Animal Courtship and Mating|courtship]].<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Head and neck feathers consist of long semi-plumes measuring up to 18&nbsp;cm long<ref name=\"King\"/> that become erectile and thereby have an important function in courtships and aggressive displays.<ref name=\"King\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Barbs on the neck feathers also have no barbules, thus making the neck appear like a translucent net.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nThe bill is straight, bluish grey, and lined with red. The final third along the bill length is dark maroon. The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is lemon-yellow or cream white<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and the legs are purplish red. The skin of the throat and the pebbly-textured [[Lore (anatomy)|lores]] are orangey red, becoming deeper red during courtship.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The sexes are largely indistinguishable externally, except that the male is slightly larger with a slightly upward curved bill.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Individuals usually weigh 4200-3800g, with males being heavier.<ref name=\"oiseaux\"/>\n\n===Juvenile appearance===\nA distinct characteristic unique to this stork species is the occurrence of intermediate dark plumage in the young,<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> which persists for most of the nestling period.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> In the chicks\u2019 first few days after hatching, their sparse [[down feather|down]] is snowy white.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The chicks subsequently undergo two basic moults in their progression to adulthood.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\">Thomas BT. 1984. Maguari stork nesting: juvenile growth and behaviour. The Auk 101: 812-823.</ref> The first moult usually begins after four days,<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> in which black semiplumes on the head and neck begin to emerge; followed shortly by emergence of greyish-black down feathers over the body after one week of age.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Some white down feathers initially remain attached to temporarily give a mottled black and white appearance<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> before finally receding to leave a darkish grey downy plumage.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> During development of the dark down, the bill, legs and feet are shiny black. A pale yellow stripe extends up the [[ventral|venter]], the [[gular pouch]] is bright orange, and the iris is dark brown. At hatching, nestlings weigh 76-90g.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nAfter three weeks of age, the black down develops olive streaks<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and the only parts of the body that do not appear dark are the bright orange gular skin and a small patch of white down above and below the tail.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Just over 10 days later, black flight feathers shortly followed by black contour feathers develop; and the chicks are fledged and have their first full juvenile plumage after about a month of hatching.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Hence, juveniles remain black at fledging,<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> by which time the orange of the gular pouch has also turned pale scarlet.\n\nIn the second moult, white down begins to return when the chicks are seven weeks old, followed by white semi-plumes then white contour feathers.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> The first white basic plumage is complete after three months and resembles that of adults.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> By this time, the legs and feet are now an incipient pink and the bill has become bicoloured (pale blue and maroon). Although the young now resemble adults, the skin surrounding the eye remains black for about a year before turning red, and the dark brown iris does not begin to yellow until after two years old.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> These are two potentially useful features that identify juvenile maguari storks; but in the field, the dark iris of the juveniles is the most reliable feature that distinguishes them from adults.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\nTwo hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dark colouration of the juveniles. First, the blackish feathers may serve as camouflage against both ground and aerial predators.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Alternatively, the black plumage may serve a [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] function by enhancing its absorption of the sun's radiation.<ref>Cowles RB, Hamilton WJ, Heppner F. 1967. Black pigmentation: adaptation for concealment or heat conservation? Science 158: 1340-1341.</ref> This could arguably be advantageous because this stork breeds during the winter in the part of its range in the southern hemisphere, so that the chicks can be exposed to low environmental temperatures.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> However, Thomas<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\">Thomas BT. 1986. The behaviour and breeding of adult maguari storks. The Condor 88: 26-34.</ref>  regards the anti-predator explanation for the dark plumage to be more plausible.\n\n===Vocalisations===\nAdults give wheezing, hissing, disyllabic whistles during up-down greeting displays at the nests that are given about every 1\u20131.5 seconds.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> These whistles are slower and lower pitched than the corresponding vocalisations of other Ciconia,<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> but sound similar to those of the [[Abdim's stork]] and the woolly-necked stork.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> The quality of these vocalisations is probably linked with the maguari stork's ground nesting habits and may be an adaptation to minimise attraction of predators\u2019 attention.<ref name=\"King\"/> Young make begging calls that have been described as ''Ehehe-ehehe''.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe maguari stork has a relatively wide distribution over much of South America, and occurs primarily to the east of the [[Andes]].<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> It lives in the [[Los Llanos (South America)|llanos]] of Venezuela and eastern [[Colombia]]; [[Guyana]]; eastern Bolivia; Paraguay; Brazil, but rarely in the Amazon and the north-east,<ref name=\"Tavares\">Tavares DC, Siciliano S. 2013.

Bird Conservation International 4: 181-190.</ref> However, overall migration patterns for this species across its range have thus far not been determined exactly.\n \nIts habitat largely comprises open lowland shallow-water wetland such as tropical wet savannah grasslands, marshes, mudflats, and flooded fields.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> It more occasionally frequents dry fields,<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> but invariably avoids forested regions.<ref name=\"Wetmore\"/> Numerous maguari stork assemblages have been observed in their habitat during the dry season, where they forage in low-level bodies of water where prey is concentrated.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork lives in sympatry with jabiru and wood stork where the ranges of these three species overlap, especially in the Venezuelan llanos.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/>  Of all American stork species, the maguari stork has the smallest geographical range.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/>\n\n==Feeding==\nThis stork has a markedly broad diet and is considered to be a [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] compared to the sympatric wood stork and jabiru.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> It feeds on fish, frogs, eels, earthworms, invertebrates, insect larvae, snakes, freshwater crabs, small mammals such as rats, and bird eggs. More rarely, it may take smaller birds; as one case has shown where a large, intact rail was discovered in the gullet of an individual from [[Patagonia]].<ref>Bent AC. 1926. Life Histories of North American Marsh Birds. Smithsonian Institution, United States Museum Bulletin 135, Washington.</ref> Despite the maguari stork's apparently generalist diet, one study from Brazil has suggested that this stork may actively target [[Amphisbaena (genus)|worm lizards]] ''Amphisbaenae'' as prey items.<ref name=\"Tozetti\">Tozetti AM, Fontana CS, Oliveira RB, Pontes GMF. 2011. Diet of a maguari stork (Ciconia maguari, Aves, Ciconiidae) in southern Brazil: the opportunist predation of snake like preys? Pan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences 6: 65-67.</ref> This may be because of the elongated body shape of such taxa that occupies a relatively small volume in the bird's stomach and hence can more compactly fit inside the stomach to optimise the bird's energy intake.<ref name=\"Tozetti\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork preferentially forages in shallow waters about 12&nbsp;cm deep, and more rarely at water depths of up to 30&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> This may be because shallow waters harbour higher numbers of prey taxa, or are high in dissolved carbon and nutrients.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/> This species is primarily a visual forager and its usual manner of hunting consists in walking slowly through wetlands with its bill close to the surface of the water, ready to seize prey encountered.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/>  It breeds early during the seasonal rains whilst the water in the wetland habitat is still clear from the fresh rainwater; so that prey items are more visible through the water and success of prey capture, especially as food for nestlings, is higher.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> However, this stork has also been observed to grope with its bill in the water,<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> although this may be more common toward the end of the breeding season when water bodies begin to dry up and become turbid.\n\nEspecially during the breeding season, the maguari stork forages solitarily or in pairs. However, it feeds in larger aggregations outside the breeding season and often also in association with other wading bird species.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The shallowness of these pools concentrates prey items, so that tactile foraging probably operates in this situation.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nAlthough the maguari stork largely depends on shallow freshwaters as a source of prey, it has also been observed to forage solitarily on dry plains outside the breeding season where mice and toads (candidate prey) sometimes occur in large numbers.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> It also forages on dry, cultivated fields where invertebrates have probably been disturbed.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> During the evenings in the dry season from December until April, individuals form large assemblages around low-lying water features where prey density is high but prey abundance is not.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\">Gonzalez JA. 1996. Kletoparasitsm in mixed-species foraging flocks of wading birds during the late dry season in the Llanos of Venezuela. Colonial Waterbirds 19: 226-231.</ref> Notably numerous assemblages of foraging maguari storks have been sighted in the Brazilian municipality [[Quissama]] during the dry season in October, where they congregate around shallow pools in search of food.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/> The maguari stork's tendency to forage in both wetlands and dry lands reflects its generalist nature, whereas specialists such as the jabiru depend more on wetlands as a source of food and are sighted more frequently near to wetlands than the maguari stork.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nIn one study at half-hectare ponds in the llanos during the dry season, a flock of 90 maguari stork individuals were observed together with jabirus and wood storks.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\"/> Because of limited prey, intra and interspecific competition inevitably occurs in such aggregations; often leading to [[kleptoparasitism]].<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\"/> Maguari storks are mostly found to steal food amongst themselves, but jabirus also occasionally steal from them large prey items such as eels.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork has also been observed to uplift cowhides in dry fields in search of potential invertebrate prey underneath.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> This occurs especially in the non-breeding season when large migratory flocks search for [[arthropods]] in the bushes and dry short grass.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Some individuals also sometimes eat pieces of cow dung.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Historically, one individual has been observed to swallow a cowhide whole.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nFood brought to nestlings by their parents includes fish and eels, small mammals such as rats, and invertebrates. However, the proportions of these taxa differ between years depending on availability<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and the food brought to the nest for the young consists predominantly of aquatic organisms.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Parents carry food to the nest as a large [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] in the throat. They regurgitate it onto the nest, whereupon it is picked up and eaten by the nestlings. Food is usually regurgitated in small parts for young nestlings, and as one large mass for older nestlings.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\n==Breeding and nesting==\nMany aspects of the maguari stork's reproductive biology and nesting strategies are unique to this species and are absent in other stork species.  Such differences in breeding and nesting habits have probably resulted from strong selection pressures that would have led this species to become adapted to survive in its open lowland wetland habitat that it originally invaded.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/>\n\n===Nesting habits===\nUnlike other stork species, this stork is commonly found to nest on the ground,<ref name=\"King\"/><ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> whereas many other stork species habitually nest at higher elevation. The nest always lies near to shallow water amongst tall grass and reeds,<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> since aquatic organisms form the bulk of the nestlings\u2019 diet.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The maguari stork's nest is also unusual in extensively comprising grass and reeds.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Common species used in nest fabrication include the reed ''[[Cyperus giganteus]]'' and the marsh grass ''Zizianopsis bonariensis'',<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> alongside other aquatic plants in the families Polygonaceae and Solinaceae.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Ground nests found in the southern parts of the maguari stork's range are one-meter-high (3.3&nbsp;ft) conical structures measuring 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;m in basal diameter, tapering to a flat platform of 1\u20131.5&nbsp;m at the top.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> The nest rises up to two feet above the surface of the water<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> and its location is largely treeless.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Hence overall, the maguari stork's nest seems to more closely resemble that of [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[screamer]]s such as the [[southern screamer]] ''Chauna torquata'' than that of other stork species.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/>\n\nIn the Venezuelan llanos, the maguari stork is also found to nest in low, thick-trunked trees including ''Ficus pertusa'' and ''Randia venezuelansis''.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> These nests comprise sticks that are usually less than a metre long and less than 2&nbsp;cm in diameter, and often from the palm species ''Copernicia tectorum''.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Nevertheless, the species does not seem to naturally perch in trees because unlike its sympatric heterospecifics such as the jabiru, it cannot stand on its [[hallux]].<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Therefore, it probably only nests opportunistically above the ground.<ref name=\"King\"/> The same nest may be used by a pair in successive years, sometimes for as long as seven years.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> However, ground nests composed of herbaceous plants usually disintegrate after a year, whereupon the same breeding pair returns to the nest site to rebuild the nest.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Both partners participate in building and lining the nest, which continues throughout incubation and brooding.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Nest lining usually begins when the base is about a metre wide, and lining material largely consists of wet grass that dries and hardens in the intense sun.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork is primarily a colonial nester, although it also less frequently nests solitarily.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Solitary nests are found to be less successful than colonial nests in terms of survival of the young,<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/><ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\">Gonzalez JA. 1998. Phenology and reproductive success of the maguari stork in the southern Llanos of Venezuela. Colonial Waterbirds 21: 135-142.</ref> but survival rates in the former appear to be more consistent.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Colonies typically consist of 5-15 nests, some of which are within 50&nbsp;cm apart in tree colonies, but at different heights.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> One colony from a study on the llanos comprised as many as 40 nests.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\"/> Colonial and solitary nesters also differ in the way they defend their nests.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Colonial nesters are more aggressive than solitary nesters and physically attack intruders with bill jabbing. Contrarily, solitary nesters use a \"lead-away\" strategy, in which the nesting bird walks up behind the intruder with threatening bill clattering, and ceases to clatter its bill when the intruder moves away from the nest.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/>\n\n===Courtship and nesting displays===\nAlthough colonial breeding is common amongst storks, the maguari stork differs in that courting takes place in congregations before established breeding pairs remove themselves to each of their nesting sites; whereas similar species such as the white stork and the oriental white stork court directly at the nest.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> These nuptial congregations in the maguari stork occur at freshwater marshes that have already been flooded with rainwater to a depth of about 20&nbsp;cm and are the venue either for the formation of new pair-bonds in young individuals or for the reunion of mates from previous years.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> In the latter case however, it is unknown whether both mates enter the courtship assembly together or locate each other after each having migrated there separately.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/>\n\nThis stork shows unique nesting behaviours not observed in many other storks and that may reflect its adaptation to nesting on the ground.<ref name=\"King\"/> For example, it is one of a minority of stork species to perform a distinct Nest Covering Display to protect nestlings from potential predators.<ref name=\"King\"/><ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> During this display, the nesting stork droops its wings along its sides with a strongly cocked tail and erect feathers on the head and neck; accompanied by a clattering of the bill that is pointed almost vertically downward.<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> Another nesting behaviour apparently unique to the maguari stork is the Mock Resting display.<ref name=\"King\"/> Here, during the presence of an intruder near the nest, the individual stands motionless with its back strongly arched, neck retracted, and wings and bill folded almost vertically downward.<ref name=\"King\"/> This behaviour likely evolved as an adaptation to ground nesting in dense vegetation because the posture maintained by the nesting bird amongst the grass and reeds may render it difficult to see by the intruder; and at the same time, the bird is poised ready to attack.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nAlthough this stork shows many common courtship displays in storks, these behaviours seem to omit some of the vocal and visual features to be replaced by an augmented tactile element.<ref name=\"King\"/> This may be yet another reflection of this stork's adaptation to nesting on the ground; in that the subdued visual displays will less likely attract the attention of predators that detect prey by sight at close range;<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and although loud vocalisations would be useful for mates to attract each other's attention, this could also render them more conspicuous to potential ground predators.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nBreeding is highly synchronised with the onset of rain during the wet season,<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> which usually lasts from May to November in the llanos of Venezuela.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> However, most breeding of the maguari stork happens from July to mid-September, which is earlier than breeding in both the sympatric wood stork and the jabiru.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Individuals begin migration to the breeding grounds as the rains begin, although some individuals may migrate and arrive early just before the rains.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Despite the lengthy wet season in the llanos, the nesting period in one year never lasts for over four months.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Elsewhere in the stork's global range, the timing of the breeding season is slightly different and somewhat shorter. In north east Argentina for example, the breeding season extends from June to August; and in east central Argentina extends from July to October,<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> with eggs probably being laid in late June and early July.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> On [[Isla Mexiana]] in eastern Brazil, the breeding season lasts only from August to September.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The timing of onset of the seasonal rain is extremely variable across the maguari stork's global range, with rainfall beginning in some years as early as late March and others as late as June.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> The start of breeding is therefore correspondingly variable; and in Argentina, nesting may commence as late as August with late rains.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> In the llanos, breeders may lay eggs as early as late May following unusually early and heavy rainfall; whereas young breeders may lay eggs as late as October with late-arriving rain.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/>\n\nThe [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size is typically 3 or 4 eggs, with an average of 3.2 being reported.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Eggs are laid on alternate days, so that hatching within clutches is highly asynchronous; with some young hatching up to a week apart.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> [[Egg incubation|Incubation]] begins after the 2nd or 3rd egg is laid, is carried out by both parents, and lasts 29\u201332 days.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The eggs are oval or subelliptical, and mean egg measurements are 75.19mm in length and 52.56mm in width;<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> with maximum egg measurements of 77.4mm in length and 56.2mm in breadth having been recorded.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> The eggs are also said to be disproportionately small compared to the laying female's body mass.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\nWeight differences between different-aged siblings have been recorded as 500-1400&nbsp;g.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Egg laying is however highly synchronous between nests in a colony, so that relatively large groups of young from different nests fledge together in batches toward the end of the wet season.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 1987\">Thomas BT. 1987.

Ornitologia Brasileira, Umo Introducao. Editora Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia.</ref> and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\nNatural enemies of this stork include [[boa constrictor]]s<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and [[crested caracara]]s (''Polyborus plancus''),<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\"/> both of which eat this species\u2019 eggs. Both of these predatory species can probably also eat maguari stork chicks that are no more than a few weeks old.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\"/> Many other potential predators such as jaguars, [[crocodilians]], [[Pampas cat]]s and [[Maned wolf|maned wolves]] could also access ground nests.  Although these animals are known to opportunistically feed on birds, no instances of predation on maguari storks have been hitherto recorded; but such predation is considered likely.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork is potentially threatened in the Pantanal, which as well as being subject to considerable land reclamation for agriculture, has hosted increased operation of hydroelectric dams, especially in the Parana river basin.<ref name=\"Antas\"/> Dams retain much water during the dry season, so that natural water features downstream are more likely to dry out completely and thereby lead to a decrease in suitable foraging sites for this stork. Conversely, during the wet season, dams can lead to extensive flooding downstream caused by the release of a large volume of water at once that renders the storks\u2019 usual foraging grounds too deep for them to stand in.<ref name=\"Antas\"/>\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nThis stork has historically been kept in captivity in places such as [[London Zoo]] in the mid-1800s<ref>Flower SS. 1925.

This should be a new target of conservationists, and a clearer overview of this stork's world status could be aided by carrying out numerous aerial surveys of nesting areas.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nThis stork may be especially vulnerable in the llanos of Venezuela.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> Its population declined strongly there in recent past decades starting from 1977<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and less than 5000 individuals were estimated to live in this region through most of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> A potentially effective conservation strategy to help protect this stork's natural habitat in the llanos is the expansion and maintenance of cattle ranches in the savanna grassland matrix in preference to crop cultivation; because such ranches are similar in vegetation structure to natural grasslands.<ref>Hoogesteijn R, Chapman CA. 1997. Large ranches as conservation tools in the Venezuelan llanos. Oryx 31: 274-284.</ref> Another potentially useful conservation measure is the deployment of artificial nesting platforms to encourage nesting of maguari storks, as has been done for the white stork in Europe.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> Despite its relatively unthreatened overall status, the maguari stork should deserve closer global population monitoring to better safeguard it from future potential large-scale declines across its entire range.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons|Ciconia maguari}}\n{{Wikispecies|Ciconia maguari}}\n\n{{Storks}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q338601}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:stork, maguari}}\n[[Category:Ciconia|maguari stork]]\n[[Category:Birds of South America]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1789|maguari stork]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n| image = Maguari Stork (Ciconia maguari).jpg\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22697688/0 |title=''Ciconia maguari'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| genus = Ciconia\n| species = maguari\n| authority = ([[Johann Friedrich Gmelin|Gmelin]], 1789)\n| synonyms = \n}}\n\nThe '''maguari stork''' (''Ciconia maguari'') is a large species of stork that inhabits seasonal wetlands over much of South America, and is very similar in appearance to the [[white stork]]; albeit slightly larger.<ref name=\"King\">King CE. 1988.

It is intermediate in size between the smaller wood stork and the larger jabiru, the two other stork species with which the maguari stork exists in [[sympatry]] in some parts of its range.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Much of the adult [[plumage]] is white, with black [[flight feather]]s and a forked blacked tail. This forked tail is shorter than the stiff white undertail coverts, so that these protrude from underneath the tail and may function aerodynamically in flight.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The forked tail clearly distinguishes the maguari stork from the white stork,<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/>  and is easily seen in flight through the white undertail coverts by an observer from the ground.<ref name=\"Wetmore\">Wetmore A. 1926.

Dent and Sons Ltd., New York.</ref>\n\nIndividuals undergo a fresh [[moult]] in the breeding season to produce brighter [[plumage]] in preparation for [[Animal Courtship and Mating|courtship]].<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Head and neck feathers consist of long semi-plumes measuring up to 18&nbsp;cm long<ref name=\"King\"/> that become erectile and thereby have an important function in courtships and aggressive displays.<ref name=\"King\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Barbs on the neck feathers also have no barbules, thus making the neck appear like a translucent net.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nThe bill is straight, bluish grey, and lined with red. The final third along the bill length is dark maroon. The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is lemon-yellow or cream white<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and the legs are purplish red. The skin of the throat and the pebbly-textured [[lores]] are orangey red, becoming deeper red during courtship.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The sexes are largely indistinguishable externally, except that the male is slightly larger with a slightly upward curved bill.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Individuals usually weigh 4200-3800g, with males being heavier.<ref name=\"oiseaux\"/>\n\n===Juvenile appearance===\nA distinct characteristic unique to this stork species is the occurrence of intermediate dark plumage in the young,<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> which persists for most of the nestling period.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> In the chicks\u2019 first few days after hatching, their sparse [[down feather|down]] is snowy white.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The chicks subsequently undergo two basic moults in their progression to adulthood.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\">Thomas BT. 1984. Maguari stork nesting: juvenile growth and behaviour. The Auk 101: 812-823.</ref> The first moult usually begins after four days,<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> in which black semiplumes on the head and neck begin to emerge; followed shortly by emergence of greyish-black down feathers over the body after one week of age.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Some white down feathers initially remain attached to temporarily give a mottled black and white appearance<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> before finally receding to leave a darkish grey downy plumage.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> During development of the dark down, the bill, legs and feet are shiny black. A pale yellow stripe extends up the [[ventral|venter]], the [[gular pouch]] is bright orange, and the iris is dark brown. At hatching, nestlings weigh 76-90g.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nAfter three weeks of age, the black down develops olive streaks<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and the only parts of the body that do not appear dark are the bright orange gular skin and a small patch of white down above and below the tail.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Just over 10 days later, black flight feathers shortly followed by black contour feathers develop; and the chicks are fledged and have their first full juvenile plumage after about a month of hatching.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Hence, juveniles remain black at fledging,<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> by which time the orange of the gular pouch has also turned pale scarlet.\n\nIn the second moult, white down begins to return when the chicks are seven weeks old, followed by white semi-plumes then white contour feathers.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> The first white basic plumage is complete after three months and resembles that of adults.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> By this time, the legs and feet are now an incipient pink and the bill has become bicoloured (pale blue and maroon). Although the young now resemble adults, the skin surrounding the eye remains black for about a year before turning red, and the dark brown iris does not begin to yellow until after two years old.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> These are two potentially useful features that identify juvenile maguari storks; but in the field, the dark iris of the juveniles is the most reliable feature that distinguishes them from adults.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\nTwo hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dark colouration of the juveniles. First, the blackish feathers may serve as camouflage against both ground and aerial predators.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/><ref name=\"Hancock\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Alternatively, the black plumage may serve a [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] function by enhancing its absorption of the sun's radiation.<ref>Cowles RB, Hamilton WJ, Heppner F. 1967. Black pigmentation: adaptation for concealment or heat conservation? Science 158: 1340-1341.</ref> This could arguably be advantageous because this stork breeds during the winter in the part of its range in the southern hemisphere, so that the chicks can be exposed to low environmental temperatures.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> However, Thomas<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\">Thomas BT. 1986. The behaviour and breeding of adult maguari storks. The Condor 88: 26-34.</ref>  regards the anti-predator explanation for the dark plumage to be more plausible.\n\n===Vocalisations===\nAdults give wheezing, hissing, disyllabic whistles during up-down greeting displays at the nests that are given about every 1\u20131.5 seconds.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> These whistles are slower and lower pitched than the corresponding vocalisations of other Ciconia,<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> but sound similar to those of the [[Abdim's stork]] and the woolly-necked stork.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> The quality of these vocalisations is probably linked with the maguari stork's ground nesting habits and may be an adaptation to minimise attraction of predators\u2019 attention.<ref name=\"King\"/> Young make begging calls that have been described as ''Ehehe-ehehe''.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe maguari stork has a relatively wide distribution over much of South America, and occurs primarily to the east of the [[Andes]].<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> It lives in the [[Los Llanos (South America)|llanos]] of Venezuela and eastern [[Colombia]]; [[Guyana]]; eastern Bolivia; Paraguay; Brazil, but rarely in the Amazon and the north-east,<ref name=\"Tavares\">Tavares DC, Siciliano S. 2013.

More rarely, it may take smaller birds; as one case has shown where a large, intact rail was discovered in the gullet of an individual from [[Patagonia]].<ref>Bent AC. 1926. Life Histories of North American Marsh Birds. Smithsonian Institution, United States Museum Bulletin 135, Washington.</ref> Despite the maguari stork's apparently generalist diet, one study from Brazil has suggested that this stork may actively target [[Amphisbaena (genus)|worm lizards]] ''Amphisbaenae'' as prey items.<ref name=\"Tozetti\">Tozetti AM, Fontana CS, Oliveira RB, Pontes GMF. 2011. Diet of a maguari stork (Ciconia maguari, Aves, Ciconiidae) in southern Brazil: the opportunist predation of snake like preys? Pan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences 6: 65-67.</ref> This may be because of the elongated body shape of such taxa that occupies a relatively small volume in the bird's stomach and hence can more compactly fit inside the stomach to optimise the bird's energy intake.<ref name=\"Tozetti\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork preferentially forages in shallow waters about 12&nbsp;cm deep, and more rarely at water depths of up to 30&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> This may be because shallow waters harbour higher numbers of prey taxa, or are high in dissolved carbon and nutrients.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/> This species is primarily a visual forager and its usual manner of hunting consists in walking slowly through wetlands with its bill close to the surface of the water, ready to seize prey encountered.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/>  It breeds early during the seasonal rains whilst the water in the wetland habitat is still clear from the fresh rainwater; so that prey items are more visible through the water and success of prey capture, especially as food for nestlings, is higher.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> However, this stork has also been observed to grope with its bill in the water,<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> although this may be more common toward the end of the breeding season when water bodies begin to dry up and become turbid.\n\nEspecially during the breeding season, the maguari stork forages solitarily or in pairs. However, it feeds in larger aggregations outside the breeding season and often also in association with other wading bird species.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The shallowness of these pools concentrates prey items, so that tactile foraging probably operates in this situation.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nAlthough the maguari stork largely depends on shallow freshwaters as a source of prey, it has also been observed to forage solitarily on dry plains outside the breeding season where mice and toads (candidate prey) sometimes occur in large numbers.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> It also forages on dry, cultivated fields where invertebrates have probably been disturbed.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> During the evenings in the dry season from December until April, individuals form large assemblages around low-lying water features where prey density is high but prey abundance is not.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\">Gonzalez JA. 1996. Kletoparasitsm in mixed-species foraging flocks of wading birds during the late dry season in the Llanos of Venezuela. Colonial Waterbirds 19: 226-231.</ref> Notably numerous assemblages of foraging maguari storks have been sighted in the Brazilian municipality [[Quissama]] during the dry season in October, where they congregate around shallow pools in search of food.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/> The maguari stork's tendency to forage in both wetlands and dry lands reflects its generalist nature, whereas specialists such as the jabiru depend more on wetlands as a source of food and are sighted more frequently near to wetlands than the maguari stork.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nIn one study at half-hectare ponds in the llanos during the dry season, a flock of 90 maguari stork individuals were observed together with jabirus and wood storks.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\"/> Because of limited prey, intra and interspecific competition inevitably occurs in such aggregations; often leading to [[kleptoparasitism]].<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\"/> Maguari storks are mostly found to steal food amongst themselves, but jabirus also occasionally steal from them large prey items such as eels.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1996\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork has also been observed to uplift cowhides in dry fields in search of potential invertebrate prey underneath.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> This occurs especially in the non-breeding season when large migratory flocks search for [[arthropods]] in the bushes and dry short grass.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Some individuals also sometimes eat pieces of cow dung.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Historically, one individual has been observed to swallow a cowhide whole.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nFood brought to nestlings by their parents includes fish and eels, small mammals such as rats, and invertebrates. However, the proportions of these taxa differ between years depending on availability<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and the food brought to the nest for the young consists predominantly of aquatic organisms.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Parents carry food to the nest as a large [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] in the throat. They regurgitate it onto the nest, whereupon it is picked up and eaten by the nestlings. Food is usually regurgitated in small parts for young nestlings, and as one large mass for older nestlings.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\n==Breeding and nesting==\nMany aspects of the maguari stork's reproductive biology and nesting strategies are unique to this species and are absent in other stork species.  Such differences in breeding and nesting habits have probably resulted from strong selection pressures that would have led this species to become adapted to survive in its open lowland wetland habitat that it originally invaded.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/>\n\n===Nesting habits===\nUnlike other stork species, this stork is commonly found to nest on the ground,<ref name=\"King\"/><ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> whereas many other stork species habitually nest at higher elevation. The nest always lies near to shallow water amongst tall grass and reeds,<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> since aquatic organisms form the bulk of the nestlings\u2019 diet.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The maguari stork's nest is also unusual in extensively comprising grass and reeds.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Common species used in nest fabrication include the reed ''[[Cyperus giganteus]]'' and the marsh grass ''Zizianopsis bonariensis'',<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> alongside other aquatic plants in the families Polygonaceae and Solinaceae.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Ground nests found in the southern parts of the maguari stork's range are one-meter-high (3.3&nbsp;ft) conical structures measuring 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;m in basal diameter, tapering to a flat platform of 1\u20131.5&nbsp;m at the top.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> The nest rises up to two feet above the surface of the water<ref name=\"Hudson\"/> and its location is largely treeless.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Hence overall, the maguari stork's nest seems to more closely resemble that of [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[screamer]]s such as the [[southern screamer]] ''Chauna torquata'' than that of other stork species.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/>\n\nIn the Venezuelan llanos, the maguari stork is also found to nest in low, thick-trunked trees including ''Ficus pertusa'' and ''Randia venezuelansis''.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> These nests comprise sticks that are usually less than a metre long and less than 2&nbsp;cm in diameter, and often from the palm species ''Copernicia tectorum''.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Nevertheless, the species does not seem to naturally perch in trees because unlike its sympatric heterospecifics such as the jabiru, it cannot stand on its [[hallux]].<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Therefore, it probably only nests opportunistically above the ground.<ref name=\"King\"/> The same nest may be used by a pair in successive years, sometimes for as long as seven years.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> However, ground nests composed of herbaceous plants usually disintegrate after a year, whereupon the same breeding pair returns to the nest site to rebuild the nest.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> Both partners participate in building and lining the nest, which continues throughout incubation and brooding.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Nest lining usually begins when the base is about a metre wide, and lining material largely consists of wet grass that dries and hardens in the intense sun.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork is primarily a colonial nester, although it also less frequently nests solitarily.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Solitary nests are found to be less successful than colonial nests in terms of survival of the young,<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/><ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\">Gonzalez JA. 1998. Phenology and reproductive success of the maguari stork in the southern Llanos of Venezuela. Colonial Waterbirds 21: 135-142.</ref> but survival rates in the former appear to be more consistent.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Colonies typically consist of 5-15 nests, some of which are within 50&nbsp;cm apart in tree colonies, but at different heights.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> One colony from a study on the llanos comprised as many as 40 nests.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\"/> Colonial and solitary nesters also differ in the way they defend their nests.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Colonial nesters are more aggressive than solitary nesters and physically attack intruders with bill jabbing. Contrarily, solitary nesters use a \"lead-away\" strategy, in which the nesting bird walks up behind the intruder with threatening bill clattering, and ceases to clatter its bill when the intruder moves away from the nest.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/>\n\n===Courtship and nesting displays===\nAlthough colonial breeding is common amongst storks, the maguari stork differs in that courting takes place in congregations before established breeding pairs remove themselves to each of their nesting sites; whereas similar species such as the white stork and the oriental white stork court directly at the nest.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> These nuptial congregations in the maguari stork occur at freshwater marshes that have already been flooded with rainwater to a depth of about 20&nbsp;cm and are the venue either for the formation of new pair-bonds in young individuals or for the reunion of mates from previous years.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> In the latter case however, it is unknown whether both mates enter the courtship assembly together or locate each other after each having migrated there separately.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/>\n\nThis stork shows unique nesting behaviours not observed in many other storks and that may reflect its adaptation to nesting on the ground.<ref name=\"King\"/> For example, it is one of a minority of stork species to perform a distinct Nest Covering Display to protect nestlings from potential predators.<ref name=\"King\"/><ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> During this display, the nesting stork droops its wings along its sides with a strongly cocked tail and erect feathers on the head and neck; accompanied by a clattering of the bill that is pointed almost vertically downward.<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> Another nesting behaviour apparently unique to the maguari stork is the Mock Resting display.<ref name=\"King\"/> Here, during the presence of an intruder near the nest, the individual stands motionless with its back strongly arched, neck retracted, and wings and bill folded almost vertically downward.<ref name=\"King\"/> This behaviour likely evolved as an adaptation to ground nesting in dense vegetation because the posture maintained by the nesting bird amongst the grass and reeds may render it difficult to see by the intruder; and at the same time, the bird is poised ready to attack.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nAlthough this stork shows many common courtship displays in storks, these behaviours seem to omit some of the vocal and visual features to be replaced by an augmented tactile element.<ref name=\"King\"/> This may be yet another reflection of this stork's adaptation to nesting on the ground; in that the subdued visual displays will less likely attract the attention of predators that detect prey by sight at close range;<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and although loud vocalisations would be useful for mates to attract each other's attention, this could also render them more conspicuous to potential ground predators.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nBreeding is highly synchronised with the onset of rain during the wet season,<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> which usually lasts from May to November in the llanos of Venezuela.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> However, most breeding of the maguari stork happens from July to mid-September, which is earlier than breeding in both the sympatric wood stork and the jabiru.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/> Individuals begin migration to the breeding grounds as the rains begin, although some individuals may migrate and arrive early just before the rains.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Despite the lengthy wet season in the llanos, the nesting period in one year never lasts for over four months.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> Elsewhere in the stork's global range, the timing of the breeding season is slightly different and somewhat shorter. In north east Argentina for example, the breeding season extends from June to August; and in east central Argentina extends from July to October,<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> with eggs probably being laid in late June and early July.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> On [[Isla Mexiana]] in eastern Brazil, the breeding season lasts only from August to September.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The timing of onset of the seasonal rain is extremely variable across the maguari stork's global range, with rainfall beginning in some years as early as late March and others as late as June.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> The start of breeding is therefore correspondingly variable; and in Argentina, nesting may commence as late as August with late rains.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> In the llanos, breeders may lay eggs as early as late May following unusually early and heavy rainfall; whereas young breeders may lay eggs as late as October with late-arriving rain.<ref name=\"Thomas 1985\"/>\n\nThe [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size is typically 3 or 4 eggs, with an average of 3.2 being reported.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Eggs are laid on alternate days, so that hatching within clutches is highly asynchronous; with some young hatching up to a week apart.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> [[Egg incubation|Incubation]] begins after the 2nd or 3rd egg is laid, is carried out by both parents, and lasts 29\u201332 days.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The eggs are oval or subelliptical, and mean egg measurements are 75.19mm in length and 52.56mm in width;<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> with maximum egg measurements of 77.4mm in length and 56.2mm in breadth having been recorded.<ref name=\"Kahl 1971\"/> The eggs are also said to be disproportionately small compared to the laying female's body mass.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\nWeight differences between different-aged siblings have been recorded as 500-1400&nbsp;g.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> Egg laying is however highly synchronous between nests in a colony, so that relatively large groups of young from different nests fledge together in batches toward the end of the wet season.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 1987\">Thomas BT. 1987. Philopatry of banded maguari storks and their decline in Venezuela. Boletin de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias 41: 137-157.</ref> This may serve as an anti-predator strategy to dilute an individual's risk of being predated.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> As adults, male maguari storks become sexually mature at three years of age, and females at four years.<ref name=\"Thomas 1987\"/>\n\nAfter three weeks of age, Maguari stork nestlings develop defensive behaviour if their nest is approached by an intruder; which is not known for nestlings of other stork species.<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> They crouch forward, partially spread their wings and erect the black feathers on their head, neck and back; followed by a shrill, rasping scream and an attempt to grab a persistent intruder with their bill.<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> In many other stork species, akinesia lasts throughout much of the nestlings\u2019 early life, and the constantly white plumage makes them appear as eggs to potential chick predators.<ref name=\"King\"/> However, in maguari stork nestlings, [[akinesia]] ceases much earlier, and the unusual aggressiveness of the young has probably developed as a specialised anti-predator strategy in compensation for the young chicks\u2019 inability to leave the nest due to their slow-developing hallux<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and the vulnerable position of the nest on the ground.<ref name=\"King\"/> However, at 25\u201335 days old, the hallux is sufficiently developed to allow the chicks to leave ground nests in search of food.<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/> Chicks also occasionally beg for food from their parents outside the nest, but parents have never been observed to feed their young outside the nest.<ref name=\"Kahl 1972\"/>\n\nThere appears to be little [[sibling rivalry (animals)|sibling rivalry]] in maguari stork nestings, with most nestling mortality being due to young falling out of nests containing 3-4 chicks;<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and egg mortality primarily through predation appears to be higher than chick mortality.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nThe large congregations of maguari storks in the pre- and post-reproductive periods are considered a reliable indicator that this stork breeds locally in the area in which the groups are sighted.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/>\n\n==Threats and survival==\nThe primary threats to this species are anthropogenic habitat disturbance and hunting for food.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> A common human disturbance occurs through habitat destruction via land reclamation from marshes for agriculture,<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> which has occurred especially in southeast Brazil and may therefore evoke conservation concern for the species in this area.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/> Claiming land for agriculture by digging canals, together with land filling and sewage discharges may also threaten dry-season foraging environments for maguari storks especially on the northern Rio de Janeiro coast.<ref name=\"Tavares\"/> The maguari stork is vulnerable to nesting habitat destruction because it shows nest-site fidelity, and will continue to nest in the same place even after onset of recent anthropogenic disturbance.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> Use of pesticides may also adversely affect the health and breeding success of this species.<ref name=\"Thomas 1986\"/> The capture of individuals for food presents another survival threat and occurs particularly in the Southern Amazon<ref name=\"Sick\">Sick H. 1985. Ornitologia Brasileira, Umo Introducao. Editora Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia.</ref> and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/>\n\nNatural enemies of this stork include [[boa constrictor]]s<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and [[crested caracara]]s (''Polyborus plancus''),<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\"/> both of which eat this species\u2019 eggs. Both of these predatory species can probably also eat maguari stork chicks that are no more than a few weeks old.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1998\"/> Many other potential predators such as jaguars, [[crocodilians]], [[Pampas cat]]s and [[Maned wolf|maned wolves]] could also access ground nests.  Although these animals are known to opportunistically feed on birds, no instances of predation on maguari storks have been hitherto recorded; but such predation is considered likely.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nThe maguari stork is potentially threatened in the Pantanal, which as well as being subject to considerable land reclamation for agriculture, has hosted increased operation of hydroelectric dams, especially in the Parana river basin.<ref name=\"Antas\"/> Dams retain much water during the dry season, so that natural water features downstream are more likely to dry out completely and thereby lead to a decrease in suitable foraging sites for this stork. Conversely, during the wet season, dams can lead to extensive flooding downstream caused by the release of a large volume of water at once that renders the storks\u2019 usual foraging grounds too deep for them to stand in.<ref name=\"Antas\"/>\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nThis stork has historically been kept in captivity in places such as [[London Zoo]] in the mid-1800s<ref>Flower SS. 1925. Contributions to our knowledge of the duration of life in vertebrate animals. IV Birds. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 1925: 1365-1422.</ref> and [[Amsterdam Zoo]] in the late 1920s, where one individual survived beyond 21 years.<ref>Brouwer K, Jones ML, King CE, Schifter H. 1992. Longevity and breeding records of storks Ciconiidae in captivity. International Zoo Yearbook 31: 131-139.</ref> Two cases of breeding have been recorded in captivity. A chick was hatched but not reared in [[Buenos Aires Zoo]] between 1946 and 1950.<ref>Haedo Rossi JA. 1969.  Notas ornitologicas. V. Observaciones sobre Cigueiia Euxenura maguari (Gmelin).

Maguari Storks hatch at Discovery Island, Florida. Specialist Group on Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills Newsletter 4: 5-6.</ref> The parents were at least 18 years old when they first bred.<ref name=\"Healy\"/> In the wild, the maguari stork is considered a game bird in Amazonia.<ref name=\"Sick\"/>\n\n==Status==\nThe maguari stork is evaluated as being of [[least concern]] because it has an extremely large geographical range, and an apparently stable world population that is suspected to be very large.<ref name=\"Birdlife\"/> Despite local declines in some parts of its range, the population is not considered to be threatened on a global scale.<ref name=\"oiseaux\"/> However, even though this stork appears to be numerous throughout its natural habitat, census data are lacking<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> and there appears to be no current estimate of the world population. This should be a new target of conservationists, and a clearer overview of this stork's world status could be aided by carrying out numerous aerial surveys of nesting areas.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\nThis stork may be especially vulnerable in the llanos of Venezuela.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> Its population declined strongly there in recent past decades starting from 1977<ref name=\"Thomas 1984\"/> and less than 5000 individuals were estimated to live in this region through most of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> A potentially effective conservation strategy to help protect this stork's natural habitat in the llanos is the expansion and maintenance of cattle ranches in the savanna grassland matrix in preference to crop cultivation; because such ranches are similar in vegetation structure to natural grasslands.<ref>Hoogesteijn R, Chapman CA. 1997. Large ranches as conservation tools in the Venezuelan llanos. Oryx 31: 274-284.</ref> Another potentially useful conservation measure is the deployment of artificial nesting platforms to encourage nesting of maguari storks, as has been done for the white stork in Europe.<ref name=\"Luthin\"/> Despite its relatively unthreatened overall status, the maguari stork should deserve closer global population monitoring to better safeguard it from future potential large-scale declines across its entire range.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons|Ciconia maguari}}\n{{Wikispecies|Ciconia maguari}}\n\n{{Storks}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q338601}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:stork, maguari}}\n[[Category:Ciconia|maguari stork]]\n[[Category:Birds of South America]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1789|maguari stork]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toLores(link changed toLore (anatomy)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguari_stork"}
