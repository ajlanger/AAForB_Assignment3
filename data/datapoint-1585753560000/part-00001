Rodenbach worked as a lawyer and journalist. He spent the last ten years of his life in Paris as the correspondent of the ''[[Journal de Bruxelles]]'', and was an intimate of [[Edmond de Goncourt]]. He published eight collections of verse and four novels, as well as short stories, stage works and criticism. He produced some Parisian and purely imitative work; but a major part of his production is the outcome of a passionate idealism of the quiet Flemish towns in which he had passed his childhood and early youth. In his best known work, ''[[Bruges-la-Morte]]'' (1892), he explains that his aim is to evoke the town as a living being, associated with the moods of the spirit, counselling, dissuading from and prompting action. ''Bruges-la-Morte'' was used by the composer [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] as the basis for his opera [[Die tote Stadt]].
