His life is only described in sources dating from the 17th century or later.<ref>Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 1-12.</ref> According to these sources he was the first ruler of Ternate to use the title [[Sultan]] rather than ''Kolano'', or king, and enacted a number of changes in the government, based on [[Islamic Law]], technically transforming Ternate into an Islamic kingdom.\n\n==Early life==\n\nAccording to [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] (1724) Gapi Buta was the son of Kolano [[Marhum of Ternate|Marhum]], the eighteenth king of [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]].<ref>Amal (2016), p. 238.</ref> Other chronicles say that his father was the seventeenth ruler Gapi Baguna II (Ngolo-ma-Caya) while his mother was a lady from the [[Sula Islands]]. Valentijn indicates that Marhum was the first recorded convert to Islam, and as such provided the young prince with an Islamic education.<ref>Amal (2002), p. 128.</ref> Under Marhum's rule, the first tenets of Islam were preached by a merchant-cum-cleric from [[Java]] named Dato Maulana Hussein who stunned the as-yet illiterate Ternatans with his reading skills.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder de Linden, p. 140.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/140/mode/2up]</ref> Some traditions, including the oldest chronicle ''Hikayat Tanah Hitu'' by Rijali (before 1657), nevertheless hold that Zainal Abidin himself first converted to the new religion.<ref>Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 6.</ref> Rijali relates that a prince and missionary from [[Samudra Pasai]] in [[Sumatra]], Mahadum by name, travelled to Maluku via [[Melaka]] and Java, successfully converting the rulers of [[Jailolo]], [[Tidore]] and Ternate in turn. Mahadum stayed in Ternate and died there, his son marrying Zainal Abidin's daughter.<ref>Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 5.</ref> Valentijn gives Zainal Abidin's regnal years as 1486-1500, though it is unclear what this is based on.<ref>Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Islamization of Ternate==\n\nTernate was one of the four traditional kingdoms in [[North Maluku]], the others being [[Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Jailolo]]. Of these, Ternate emerged as the stronger component at an early date, though it was severely contested by the others. As soon as he was appointed ruler, according to Valentijn, Zainal Abidin had to deal with aggression from the powerful Jailolo kingdom that was based in [[Halmahera]] and allied with Tidore. Eventually the warring parts made peace in 1488, leaving the ruler free to bring Ternate on the track to ordered Islamic governance.<ref>Hanna & Alwi (1996); Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724), p. 141.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/140/mode/2up]</ref> Lots of Muslim Javanese traders frequented Ternate at the time and incited the king to learn more about the new creed. In c. 1495, he traveled with his companion Hussein to study Islam in Giri ([[Gresik]]) on Java's north coast, where [[Sunan Giri]] kept a well-known [[madrasa]].<ref>Soejono (2008), p. 194; Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724), p. 143.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/142/mode/2up].</ref>  While there, he won renown as ''Sultan Bualawa'', or Sultan of Cloves.<ref>Amal (2016), p. 64.</ref> He was well respected, known as a valiant warrior and pious scholar, and developed friendships which developed into strong alliances. One story told of his time there is that he stood up to a crazed killer on the rampage while others fled, beheading him with a single stroke.<ref>Amal (2016), p. 65.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Hikayat Tanah Hitu'', Zainal Abidin stopped in [[Bima]] in [[Sumbawa]] on his way back to Maluku. He and his crew got into trouble with the local king and a fight took place where a Bimanese wounded Zainal Abidin with his spear. The bodyguards of the ruler brought him back to the ship, though he passed away on board. The account of Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn, on the contrary, insists that he survived the battle and made it back to Ternate.<ref>Hans H\u00e4gerdal (2017), ''Held's history of Sumbawa''. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University press, p. 34.</ref> On his return, he replaced the royal title ''Kolano'' with ''Sultan'', and it may have been now that he adopted the Islamic name Zainal Abidin.<ref>Putuhena (2007), p. 101.</ref> He brought back a ''mubaligh'' from Java named Tuhubahanui to propagate the Islamic faith and created a ''Bobato'' (headman) to assist in all matters relating to the rule of Islamic law across the Sultanate.<ref>Office of Islamic Information Service (1980), p. 28.</ref> The background to this transformation is the inter-regional network that developed during the 15th century with the lucrative trade in [[cloves]] and exotic forest products. This trade attracted Indian, Javanese and Malay traders who were often Muslims. European accounts date the introduction of Islam to about the 1460s or 1460s.<ref>Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 32.</ref> Far into the 16th century, however, European observers noted that Islam was mostly confined to the highest elite. The great dissemination of Islam in Maluku came later, after 1570.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 57, 134.</ref>\n\n==Expansion of political influence==\n\nZainal Abidin's reign coincided with the rise of the noble houses of Tomaitu and Tomagola who were instrumental in spreading the political influence of Ternate. Members of the Tomaitu went to the [[Sula Islands]] where they acted as sub-rulers with the title ''Kimelaha''. The Tomagola, on their part, settled in [[Buru Island]] and later established their authority in the [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] Quarter, settling at the inner coast of [[Seram Island|Ceram]].<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724), p. 142.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/142/mode/2up]</ref> These migrations had a long lasting impact. The friendship pact that the Sultan concluded with Pati Puti (or Pati Tuban), one of the petty rulers from Ambon, also contributed to the claims made by Ternate to the southern parts of Maluku: Buru, Seram, Ambon, the [[Lease Islands|Lease]] and [[Banda Islands]].<ref>Abdurachman (2008), p. 188.</ref> A 19th-century chronicle claims that Zainal Abidin, at the time when he returned from Java, subdued half of [[Sulawesi]].<ref>Na\u00efdah (1878) \"Geschiednis van Ternate\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 4:II, p. 443.</ref> These areas are, however only documented as Ternatan vassals in the second half of the 16th century.<ref>P.A.
