They often have elevated train-type doors instead of traditional [[bus doors]] to use dedicated stations. Payment is typically made at a bus station using a [[paid area|fare gate]] rather than on the bus.\n\nCompared to using multiple smaller buses on a route, challenges using a bi-articulated bus include: \n* difficulties maneuvering in traffic\n* an increased turning radius{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* the need to have extended length station platforms\n* reduced frequency of service (one larger bus every 10 minutes rather than two regular sized buses coming once every 5 minutes) \n* less flexibility for scheduling, routing, and maintenance. \nHowever, an bi-articulated bus requires fewer drivers relative to the number of passengers per bus.\n\n==Early versions==\nIn the late 1980s, the French manufacturers [[Renault]] and [[Heuliez Bus]] developed the \"M\u00e9gabus\" (officially the Heuliez GX237), a bi-articulated high-floor bus. The demonstrator M\u00e9gabus visited transit agencies throughout France, but the only city to order them was [[Bordeaux]] (an order of 10 buses, built in 1989). These buses, now retired, were used on Bordeaux's bus route 7{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} until the city's [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram system]] opened in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html |title=French buses - the Megabus and other PR100 oddities |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205152430/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html |archive-date=December 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHungarian bus manufacturer [[Ikarus Bus|Ikarus]] also developed a bi-articulated bus prototype, the Ikarus 293, in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autobusovenoviny.cz/clanek/935/ikarus-293|title=Autobusov\u00e9 noviny :: IKARUS 293|accessdate=2010-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718164633/http://www.autobusovenoviny.cz/clanek/935/ikarus-293|archive-date=2011-07-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bucharest]], the ITB (today the [[Societatea de Transport Bucure\u0219ti|STB]]) operated a double articulated [[trolleybus]] (unofficially called DAC 122E), made by adding a modified section between the first and the last sections of a [[Rocar DAC|DAC]] 117E articulated trolleybus, one of the sections coming from a damaged DAC 117E. This vehicle was built to fulfill the need of high capacity person transportation, which was proving difficult for the ITB in 1988, when the prototype was made. However, the DAC 117E's 125 kW traction motor proved insufficient for such a heavy vehicle, let alone the weight of passengers when it operated at full capacity. As a result, the vehicle was very slow and had trouble operating on grades, especially the incline between Ci\u0219migiu Park and University Square. It also had trouble making sharp turns and was difficult to control, especially on snow or ice. This trolleybus was operated on long lines with wide roads and no major turns except the end of the lines like 69 and 90, but occasionally entered on lines 85, 66, 79 and 86. Bucharest traffic became increasingly intense in the very late 1990s, and RATB sought shorter trolleybuses. The DAC 122E was withdrawn from regular service, being occasionally used on lines 69 and 90 until 2000 when it was fully removed from service, displaced by the then-new [[Ikarus 415T]]s and scrapped. Bucharest no longer operates bi-articulated vehicles (except for trams) due to high traffic levels, which is also the reason why between 2007 and 2018, the RATB refused to operate normal articulated buses.\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Doppelgelenkbus 02 KMJ.jpg|thumb|A [[Van Hool]] bi-articulated bus in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]\n[[File:AutoTram Extra Grand 2013.JPG|thumb|An AutoTram Extra Grand]]\n[[File:Hess LighTram in Groningen.JPG|thumb|Bi-articulated bus is presented to the public in [[Groningen]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nA bi-articulated bus is a long vehicle and usually requires a specially trained driver, as maneuvering (particularly reversing) can be difficult. Articulated electric [[Trolleybus|trolleybuses]] can be difficult to control, with their motors producing momentary peak power in excess of 600 [[Kilowatt|kilowatts]] (816 [[Metric horsepower|PS]]; 805 [[Horsepower|hp]]). The trailer section of a \"puller\" bus can be subject to unusual [[Centripetal force|centripetal forces]], which many people can find uncomfortable, although this is not an issue with \"pushers\".\n\nThe transit system that has used bi-articulated buses the longest is the ''[[Rede Integrada de Transporte]]'', in [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], which provides a type of service that has come to be known \u2013 particularly in [[American English]] \u2013 as [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT), where buses run in dedicated lanes and stop only at enclosed stations.

These buses are used in the [[Germany|German]] cities of [[Aachen]] (lines 5 and 45) and [[Hamburg]] (''Metrobus'' 5 and ''Eilbus'' E86), where single-articulated buses alone were not able to handle the huge number of passengers per day. In Hamburg they were retired in 2018 after 13 years of service as they started to require more and more maintenance due to their growing age and an unusual level of wear and tear, caused by the second articulation joint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mopo.de/hamburg/tschues--langer--heute-rollt-der-letzte-xxl-bus-durch-hamburg-31266010|publisher=Hamburger Morgenpost|date=14 September 2018|language=German|accessdate=2018-09-15|title=Tsch\u00fcs, Langer!

In 2016 these busses were moved to [[Utrecht]] because the few stops and higher speeds on this line made the hybrid engine perform poorly.\n\n===Sweden===\n[[Volvo]] has manufactured several bi-articulated buses now in use in [[Gothenburg]]. They are based on Volvo's \"puller\"-type articulated, low-floor bus model with the [[internal combustion engine]] mounted on the floor on the side of the bus, and the cooling system on the roof. They have not manufactured anymore and are currently being replaced by normal articulated buses.\n\n===Switzerland===\nThe [[Switzerland|Swiss]] manufacturer [[Carrosserie Hess|Hess]] produces a bi-articulated [[trolleybus]] called LighTram that is in use in several Swiss cities, including [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Geneva]] and [[Lucerne]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Buses}}\n*[[List of buses]]\n*[[Trailer bus]]\n*[[Road train]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Bi-articulated buses}}\n*[https://archive.is/20070526224603/http://www.vanhool.com/images/bussen/AGG300.jpg Photo of an early Van Hool AGG300]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080225094320/http://ams.llr.se/CumulusE_Z/VBC_ImageGallery/ Image gallery of Volvo BRT systems, some bi-articulated]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071205152430/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.fuller1/GX237.html Details of the Renault Heuliez M\u00e9gabus]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023045810/http://www.busandcoach.com/newsStory.aspx?id=429 Press release about introduction of Volvo bi-articulated buses in Gothenburg, Sweden]\n**[http://www.busportal.cz/modules.php?name=article&sid=1571 showing the articulation better]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080328001401/http://www.neoplan.com.cn/eng/index1.asp Youngman-Neoplan China (Flash + JavaScript)]\n\n{{buses}}\n{{bus rapid transit}}\n{{Public transport}}\n\n [[Category:Bi-articulated buses| ]]\n[[Category:Buses by type]]\n", "name_user": "TrainSimFan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly versions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-articulated_bus"}
