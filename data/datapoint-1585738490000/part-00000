The piece is in the ''[[tintinnabular]]'' style, wherein a ''melodic voice'', operating over [[diatonic scales]], and ''tintinnabular voice'', operating within a [[triad (music)|triad]] on the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], accompany each other. It is about ten minutes long.\n\n==Description==\nThe piece was originally written for a single [[piano]] and [[violin]] \u2013 though the violin has often been replaced with either a [[cello]] or a [[viola]]. Versions also exist for [[double bass]], [[clarinet]], [[French horn|horn]], [[flugelhorn]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[bassoon]], [[trombone]], and [[percussion]]. The piece is an example of [[minimal music]].\n\nThe piece is in [[F major]] in 6/4 time, with the piano playing rising [[crotchet]] triads and the second instrument playing slow F major scales, alternately rising and falling, of increasing length, which all end on the note A (the [[mediant]] of F). The piano's left hand also plays notes, synchronised with the violin (or other instrument).\n\n\"Spiegel im Spiegel\" in [[German language|German]] literally can mean both \"mirror in the mirror\" as well as \"mirrors in the mirror\", referring to an [[infinity mirror]], which produces an [[infinity]] of [[image]]s reflected by [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[plane mirror]]s: the tonic triads are endlessly repeated with small variations as if reflected back and forth.<ref>https://kenan.monsite-orange.fr/page-5e179d3cdffc8.html</ref> The structure of melody is made by couple of phrases characterized by the alternation between ascending and descending movement with the fulcrum on the note A. This, with also the overturning of the final intervals between adjacent phrases (for example, ascending sixth in the question{{snd}}descending sixth in the answer), contribute to give the impression of a figure reflecting on a mirror and walking back and towards it.\n\nIn 2011, the piece was the focus of a half-hour [[BBC Radio 4]] programme, ''Soul Music'', which examined pieces of music \"with a powerful emotional impact\". Violinist [[Tasmin Little]] discussed her relationship to the piece.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013q20t BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music, Series 12, Spiegel im Spiegel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe piece has been used in television, film and theatre including:\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year !!Type !!Title !!Director \n|-\n|1996 || film || ''[[Mother Night (film)|Mother Night]]'' ||[[Keith Gordon]]\n|-\n|2001 || film || ''[[In Praise of Love (film)|In Praise of Love]]'' || [[Jean-Luc Godard]]\n|-\n|2001 || film || ''[[The Officers' Ward (film)|The Officers' Ward]]'' || [[Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron]]\n|-\n|2001 || film || ''[[Wit (film)|Wit]]'' || [[Mike Nichols]]\n|-\n|2002 || film || ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'' || [[Gus Van Sant]]\n|-\n|2002 || short film || ''Dans le Noir du Temps'' || [[Jean-Luc Godard]]\n|-\n|2002 || film || ''[[Heaven (2002 film)|Heaven]]'' || [[Tom Tykwer]]\n|-\n|2002 || film || ''[[Soldados de Salamina (film)|Soldados de Salamina]]'' (Spain) || [[David Trueba]]\n|-\n|2002 || film || ''[[Swept Away (2002)|Swept Away]]'' || [[Guy Ritchie]]\n|-\n|2002 || film || ''[[On the Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate]]'' || [[Hong Sang-soo]]\n|-\n|2004 || film || ''[[Dear Frankie]]'' ||[[Shona Auerbach]]\n|-\n|2005 || film || ''[[Time to Leave]]'' || [[Fran\u00e7ois Ozon]]\n|-\n|2005 || documentary || ''[[Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution']]'' || [[Laurence Rees]] and [[Catherine Tatge]]\n|-\n|2008 || film || ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]'' || [[Isabel Coixet]]\n|-\n|2011 || film || ''[[Burning Man (film)|Burning man]]'' || [[Jonathan Teplitzky]]\n|-\n|2011 || film || ''[[This Must Be the Place (film)|This Must Be the Place]]'' || [[Paolo Sorrentino]]\n|-\n|2011 || documentary || ''[[Umbrella man (JFK assassination)|The Umbrella Man]]'' - New York Times Op-Docs || [[Errol Morris]]\n|-\n|2013 || film || ''[[About Time (2013 film)|About Time]]'' || [[Richard Curtis]]\n|-\n|2012 || trailer || ''[[Silent House (film)|Silent House]]'' ||\n|-\n|2013 || trailer || ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' ||[[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]]\n|-\n|2013 || film || ''[[The East (film)|The East]]'' ||[[Zal Batmanglij]]\n|-\n|2013 || film || ''[[Movie 43]]'' ||[[Peter Farrelly]] and others\n|-\n|2014 || film || ''[[The Way He Looks]]'' || [[Daniel Ribeiro]]\n|-\n|2015 || film || ''[[La T\u00eate haute (film)|La t\u00eate haute]]'' || [[Emmanuelle Bercot]]\n|-\n|2017|| film || ''[[Foxtrot (2017 film)|Foxtrot]]'' || [[Samuel Maoz]]\n|-\n|2017|| film || ''[[Novitiate (film)|Novitiate]]'' || [[Maggie Betts]]\n|}\n\n===Dance===\n*[[David Nixon (choreographer)|David Nixon]]'s ''Dracula'' performed by the [[Northern Ballet]] (UK, 2009)\n*[[Pilobolus (dance company)|Pilobolus]]' ''Rushes'' in a scene choreographed using chairs.
