{"title_page": "Legislature", "text_new": "{{short description|Deliberative assembly that makes laws}}\n{{Legislature}}\n{{Politics sidebar|Organs}}\n\nA '''legislature''' is a [[deliberative assembly]] with the [[authority]] to make [[Law|laws]] for a [[Polity|political entity]] such as a [[Sovereign state|country]] or [[city]]. Legislatures form important parts of most [[Government|governments]]; in the [[separation of powers]] model, they are often contrasted with the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of government.\n\nLaws enacted by legislatures are usually known as [[primary legislation]]. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the [[budget]] involved. \n\nThe members of a legislature are called [[legislator]]s. In a [[democracy]], legislators are most commonly popularly [[Election|elected]], although [[indirect election]] and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures featuring an [[upper chamber]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Legislation Terminology Map.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Map showing the terminology for each country's national legislature]]\nThe name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.  \n\nCommon names include:\n\n* Assembly (from ''to assemble'')\n* Congress (from ''to congregate'')\n* Diet\n* Duma (from Russian ''d\u00fama'' 'thought')\n*Parliament (from French ''parlez'' 'to speak')\n\nThough the and specific rules for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.\n\n== History ==\nAmong the earliest recognised legislatures was the [[Athens|Athenian]] ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].''<ref name=\":0\" /> In the [[Middle Ages]], European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.<ref name=\":0\" /> The oldest surviving legislature is the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] [[Althing]], founded in 930 CE.\n\n== Functions ==\nDemocratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=128\u2013130|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Representation ===\nThere exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;\n* Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;\n* Descriptively: how well the composition of the legilsature matches the demographics of the wider society;\n* Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;\n* Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.\n\n=== Deliberation ===\nOne of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.<ref name=\":0\" /> This can take place in two forms. In debating legislatures, like [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], there is lively debate on the floor of the legislature.<ref name=\":0\" /> Contrastingly, in committee-based legislatures like the [[United States Congress]], the deliberation takes place in closed committees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Legislation ===\nWhile legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system. In [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in [[continental Europe]] and those in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]] of the [[Americas]] have more independence in drafting and amending bills.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=130\u2013131|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Authorizing expenditure ===\nThe origins of the [[power of the purse]] which legislatures typically have in passing or denying [[Government budget|government budgets]] goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the [[Monarch|monarchs]] would have to consult before raising taxes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=131\u2013132|oclc=961119208}}</ref> For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Making governments ===\nThe power of the legislature over the government is stronger in [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], where the former can remove the latter, but weaker in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], where there is a [[separation of powers]] between the two.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Oversight ===\nThere are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including [[Question time|questioning]], [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellations]], and [[Motion of no confidence|votes of confidence]].\n\n=== Function in authoritarian regimes ===\nIn contrast to [[Democracy|democratic]] systems, legislatures under [[authoritarianism]] are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve by:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n* Providing legitimacy;\n* Incorporating opponents into the system;\n* Providing some representation of outside interests;\n* Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;\n* Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.\n\n== Internal organization ==\nEach chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of [[parliamentary procedure]] to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a [[quorum]].\n\nSome of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to [[committee]]s made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).\n\nThe members of a legislature usually represent different [[Political party|political parties]]; the members from each party generally meet as a [[caucus]] to organize their internal affairs.\n\n==Relation to other branches of government==\nLegislatures vary widely in the amount of [[Politics|political]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] they wield, compared to other political players such as [[Judiciary|judiciaries]], [[Military|militaries]], and [[Executive (government)|executives]]. In 2009, political scientists [[Steven Fish|M. Steven Fish]] and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German [[Bundestag]], the [[Italian Parliament]], and the Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]] and Somalia's [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Assembly]] (since replaced by the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]) tied for least powerful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The handbook of national legislatures: a global survey|last=Fish|first=M.

Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.\n\nIn [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] systems of [[government]], the [[Executive branch|executive]] is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]. On the other hand, according to the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, the legislature in a [[presidential system]] is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the [[Judicial branch|judiciary]] and the executive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Systems and Executive-Legislative Relations (Presidential, Parliamentary and Hybrid Systems) |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |url=http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |accessdate=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164441/http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |archivedate=2008-10-17 }}</ref>\n\nLegislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to [[Administrative agency|administrative]] or [[Executive agency|executive agencies]].<ref name=\"Schoenbrod\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schoenbrod |first= David | editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Delegation  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |accessdate= |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n74 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 117\u201318 |quote=|ref= }} </ref>\n\n==Members==\nLegislatures are made up of individual members, known as [[Legislator|legislators]], who [[Voting|vote]] on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of \"seats\" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 \"seats\" has 100 members. By extension, an [[electoral district]] that elects a single legislator can also be described as a \"seat\", as, for, example, in the phrases \"[[safe seat]]\" and \"[[marginal seat]]\".\n\n==Chambers==\n[[File:Vista panor\u00e1mica del Hemiciclo de sesiones del Congreso del Peru.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]], the country's national legislature, meets in the [[Legislative Palace (Peru)|Legislative Palace]] in 2010]]\n\nA legislature may [[debate]] and [[vote]] upon [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], called by various names including [[Chambers of parliament|''legislative chambers'']], [[Debate chamber|''debate chambers'']], and ''houses'', which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]], one divided into two chambers is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], and one divided into three chambers is [[Tricameralism|tricameral]].\n[[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|left|The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], its lower house]]\nIn bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the [[upper house]], while the other is considered the [[lower house]]. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by [[Administrative division|administrative divisions]] rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], the upper house has equal or even greater power. \n[[File:Deutscher Bundestag Plenarsaal Seitenansicht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]], its theoretical lower house]]\n\nIn [[federation]]s, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the [[European Union]]. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments{{spaced ndash}}as in the European Union and in [[Germany]] and, [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|before 1913, in the United States]]{{spaced ndash}}or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in [[Australia]] and the United States since 1913.\n[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]], its upper house]]\n[[Tricameral]] legislatures are rare; the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]] still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in [[South Africa]].
