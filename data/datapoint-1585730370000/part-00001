It is the capital of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] and the [[List of cities in Argentina by population|second most populous]] city in Argentina after Buenos Aires, with about 1.3 million inhabitants according to the 2010 census. It was founded on 6 July 1573 by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], who named it after [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. It was one of the first Spanish colonial capitals of the region that is now Argentina (the oldest city is [[Santiago del Estero]], founded in 1553). The [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]] is the oldest university of the country and the seventh to be inaugurated in [[Spanish America]]. It was founded in 1613 by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. Because of this, C\u00f3rdoba earned the nickname ''La Docta'' (\"the learned\").\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments preserved from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial rule]], especially buildings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The most recognizable is perhaps the [[Jesuit Block]] (Spanish: ''Manzana Jesu\u00edtica''), declared in 2000 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=995 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2000-11-30 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> which consists of a group of buildings dating from the 17th century, including the [[Colegio Nacional de Monserrat]] and the colonial university campus. The campus belongs today to the historical museum of the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], which has been the second-largest university in the country since the early 20th century (after the [[University of Buenos Aires]]), in number of students, faculty, and academic programs. C\u00f3rdoba is also known for its historical movements, such as [[Cordobazo]] and La Reforma del '18 (known as [[University Revolution]] in English).\n\n==History==\n===First settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn 1570, Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] entrusted the Spanish settler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], with the task of populating and founding a settlement in the [[Punilla Valley]]. Cabrera sent an expedition of 48 men to the territory of the [[Comechingones]]. He divided the principal column that entered through the north of the provincial territory at [[Villa Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Villa Mar\u00eda]].\nThe one hundred man expedition set foot on what today is C\u00f3rdoba on 24 June 1573. Cabrera called the nearby river San Juan (today [[Suqu\u00eda]]). The settlement was officially founded on 6 July of the same year and named C\u00f3rdoba de la Nueva Andaluc\u00eda, possibly in honour of ancestors of the founder's wife, originally from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. The foundation of the city took place on the left bank of the river on Francisco de Torres' advice.\n[[File:Primera traza de C\u00f3rdoba.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the first map of C\u00f3rdoba (1577)]]\n\nThe settlement was inhabited by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|aboriginal people]] called [[Comechingones]], who lived in communities called Ayllus. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement's authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suqu\u00eda River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa, planned the first layout of the city as a grid of seventy blocks. Once the city core had been moved to its current location, it acquired a stable population. Its economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.\n\nIn 1599, the religious order of the [[Jesuits]] arrived in the settlement. They established a [[Novitiate]] in 1608 and, in 1610, the Colegio Maximo, which became the University of C\u00f3rdoba in 1613 (today [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]]), the fourth-oldest in the Americas. The local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Church remains one of the oldest buildings in South America and contains the Monserrat Secondary School, a church, and residential buildings. To maintain such a project, the Jesuits operated five ''[[Jesuit Reductions|Reducciones]]'' in the surrounding fertile valleys, including Caroya, [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda]], Santa Catalina, [[Alta Gracia]] and Candelaria.\n\nThe farm and the complex, started in 1615, had to be vacated by the Jesuits following the 1767 decree by King [[Charles III of Spain]] that expelled them from the continent. They were then run by the [[Franciscan]]s until 1853, when the Jesuits returned to the Americas. Nevertheless, the university and the high-school were nationalized a year later.\nEach [[Estancia]] has its own church and set of buildings, around which towns grew, such as [[Alta Gracia]], the closest to the Block.\n\n===Early European settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Rafael de Sobremonte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael de Sobremonte, 3rd Marquis of Sobremonte|Rafael de Sobremonte]], governor of C\u00f3rdoba from 1784 to 1799]]\n\nIn 1776, [[King Carlos III]] created the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], in which C\u00f3rdoba stays in 1785 as the Government Intendency of C\u00f3rdoba, including the current territories of the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba, [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] and the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]].\n\nAccording to the 1760 census, the population of the city was 22,000 inhabitants. During the May Revolution in 1810, the widespread opinion of the most notable citizens was of continuing respecting the orders of [[Fernando VII]], attitude assumed by the local authorities, which led to the [[Liniers Counter-revolution]]. This position was not shared by the [[Dean Funes|Dean Gregorio Funes]], who was adhering to the revolutionary ideas, beside supporting contact with [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli]].\n\nIn March 1816, the Argentine Congress met in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]] for an independence resolution. C\u00f3rdoba sent [[Eduardo P\u00e9rez Bulnes]], [[Settler|Jer\u00f3nimo Salguero de Cabrera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera]], and to the Canon of the cathedral Michael Calixto of the Circle, all of them of autonomous position.\n\nThe 1820s belonged to [[caudillos]], since the country was in full process of formation. Until 1820 a central government taken root in Buenos Aires existed, but the remaining thirteen provinces felt that after 9 July 1816 what had happened it was simply a change of commander. The Battle of Cepeda pitted the commanders of the Littoral against the inland forces.\n\nFinally, the Federales obtained the victory, for what the country remained since then integrated by 13 autonomous provinces, on the national government having been dissolved.\nFrom this way the period known like about the Provincial Autonomies began. From this moment the provinces tried to create a [[Federal government|federal]] system that was integrating them without coming to good port, this mainly for the regional differences of every province.\n\nTwo C\u00f3rdoba figures stood out in this period: Governor Juan Bautista Bustos, who was an official of the Army of the North and in 1820 was supervised by the troops quartered in Arequito, a town near C\u00f3rdoba, and his ally and later enemy, General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Paz]]. In 1821, Bustos repelled the invasion of C\u00f3rdoba on the part of Francisco Ram\u00edrez and his [[Chile]]an ally, General [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]]. The conflict originated in a dispute with the power system that included the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], C\u00f3rdoba and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]; according to the 1822 census the total population of C\u00f3rdoba was of 11,552 inhabitants.\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:Avenida Col\u00f3n de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina) a\u00f1os 1900.png|thumb|Col\u00f3n Avenue, c. 1900.]]\n[[File:Avenida Olmos, C\u00f3rdoba (1943).jpg|thumb|Olmos Avenue (1943).]]\n[[File:Mapa relieve cordoba argentina.png|thumb|Topographical relief map of the city of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the process of national industrialization began with the height of the economic agro-exporting model, principally of meats and cereals. This process is associated with the [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigration]] who began to settle the city, generally possessing the education and enterprising capacity appropriate for the development of industry. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy (initially from [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]]; later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]]), and Spain (mostly [[Galicians]] and [[Basques]])\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the city had 90,000 inhabitants. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The city's physiognomy changed considerably following the construction of new avenues, walks and public squares, as well as the installation of an electrified tram system, in 1909. In 1918, C\u00f3rdoba was the epicentre of a movement known as the [[University reform in Argentina|University Reform]], which then spread to the rest of the Universities of the country, Americas and [[Spain]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe development of the domestic market, the [[English settlement in Argentina|British investments]] that facilitated European settlement, the development of the railways on the [[pampas]] rapidly industrialized the city. C\u00f3rdoba's industrial sector first developed from the need to transform [[raw materials]] such as leather, [[meats]] and [[wool]] for export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |title=Cordoba.gov: ciudad hist\u00f3rica Ciudad Historica |publisher=Cordoba.gov.ar |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2014-04-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003125609/http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, the Military Aircraft Manufacturer (FMA) was inaugurated. The facility would become one of the most important in the world after [[World War II]] with the arrival of German technical personnel. From 1952, its production began to diversify, to constitute the base of the former Institute Aerot\u00e9cnico, the state-owned company Aeronautical and Mechanical Industries of the State (IAME). C\u00f3rdoba was chosen as the site of The ''Instituto Aerot\u00e9cnico'' that later became the ''F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones''. It employed the Focke Wulf men until President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] was ousted by a [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|coup in 1955]]. [[Lockheed Martin]] purchased FMA in 1995.\n\nC\u00f3rdoba, according to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province's total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning C\u00f3rdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city's population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living standards rose with the increase in the national consumption of C\u00f3rdoba's industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nAt times rivaling Buenos Aires for its importance in national politics, C\u00f3rdoba was the site of the initial mutiny leading to the 1955 ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that deposed President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and the setting for the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'', a series of violent labor and student protests that ultimately led to [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elections in 1973]]. C\u00f3rdoba's current economic diversity is due to a vigorous services sector and the demand for agro-industrial and railway equipment and, in particular, the introduction of U.S. and European automakers after 1954.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Location of Cordoba City Argentina.svg|thumb|Location of C\u00f3rdoba.<br />1.

Summers run from late November till early March, and bring days between {{convert|28|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and night between {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} with frequent thunderstorms. Heat waves are common, and bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and hot, sticky nights; however, Pampero winds are sure to bring relief with thunderstorms and a day or two of cool, crisp weather: nighttime temperatures can easily descend to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or less, but the heat starts building up right away the next day.\n\nBy late February or early March, nights start getting cooler and, in March, highs average {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; after cold fronts, lows below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and highs below {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are recorded in this month.\nApril is significantly drier already; highs reach {{convert|24|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} on average and lows {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, creating very pleasant conditions. In some years, temperatures can approach or even reach the freezing point in late April; however, heat waves of up to {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are still possible, but nights are rarely as hot as in the summer.\nMay usually brings the first frosts, and very dry weather, with under {{convert|20|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain expected. Highs average {{convert|21|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows average {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; however, when cold waves reach the area, highs may stay below {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows can be well below freezing.\n\nWinter lasts from late May till early September, and bring average highs of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows of {{convert|4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. However, strong northwesterly winds downsloping from the mountains can bring what is known as \"Veranito\" (little summer) with highs of up to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or more and dusty, windy weather (but dry, pleasant nights) for 2\u20133 days. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Conversely, when storms stall over the Atlantic coast, there may be several days of drizzle and cool weather, and when cold air masses invade the country from Antarctica (several times every winter), there may be one or two days with temperatures around {{convert|6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, drizzle and high winds (which combined make it feel very cold), followed by dry, cold weather with nighttime lows between {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and daytime highs between {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Snowfall is very rare in the city, but more frequent in the outskirts where the Sierras begin {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}; sleet may fall every once in a while. The record low temperature for C\u00f3rdoba is {{convert|-8.3|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. In June, only {{convert|3.5|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain are expected, compared to {{convert|168|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January.\n\nSpring is extremely variable and windy: there may be long stretches of cool, dry weather and cold nights followed by intense heat waves up to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, followed by the most severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds. It is not unusual to see temperatures drop {{convert|20|C-change|0|abbr=on}} from one day to another, or to have frost following extreme heat. Drought is most common in this season, when the normal summer rainfall arrives later than expected.\nBy October, days are warm at {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but nights remain cold at {{convert|11|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, by late November, the weather resembles summer weather with cooler nights.\n\nThe wealthier suburbs west of the city are located at slightly higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, C\u00f3rdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity and the possibility of fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.\n\nThe variations or thermal extents are greater than in Buenos Aires, and lower in annual rainfall: {{convert|750|mm|0|abbr=on}} / year. The annual average temperature calculated during the 20th century was 18&nbsp;\u00b0C. In January, the hottest month of the austral summer, the average maximum is 31&nbsp;\u00b0C and the minimum 17&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn July, the coldest month of the year, the average temperatures are between 19&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn winter it is very frequent that temperatures rise above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C, due to the influence of the wind Zonda.\n\nDue to the extension of the [[metropolitan area]], there exists a difference of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C between the central area and the Greater C\u00f3rdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important [[heat island]]. In addition the city presents a phenomenon of smog, but not so dense as to present health concerns.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = C\u00f3rdoba Observatory, C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina (1981\u20132010, extremes 1961\u2013present)\n|single line = y\n|metric first = y\n|collapsed = y\n|Jan record high C = 41.6\n|Feb record high C = 41.2\n|Mar record high C = 39.4\n|Apr record high C = 36.2\n|May record high C = 35.5\n|Jun record high C = 32.8\n|Jul record high C = 34.3\n|Aug record high C = 38.2\n|Sep record high C = 41.1\n|Oct record high C = 42.0\n|Nov record high C = 41.5\n|Dec record high C = 43.5\n|year record high C = 43.5\n|Jan high C = 30.9\n|Feb high C = 29.6\n|Mar high C = 28.1\n|Apr high C = 24.8\n|May high C = 21.3\n|Jun high C = 18.7\n|Jul high C = 18.3\n|Aug high C = 21.1\n|Sep high C = 23.2\n|Oct high C = 26.6\n|Nov high C = 28.7\n|Dec high C = 30.3\n|year high C = 25.1\n|Jan mean C = 24.3\n|Feb mean C = 23.1\n|Mar mean C = 21.7\n|Apr mean C = 18.0\n|May mean C = 14.5\n|Jun mean C = 11.4\n|Jul mean C = 10.8\n|Aug mean C = 13.3\n|Sep mean C = 15.7\n|Oct mean C = 19.5\n|Nov mean C = 21.8\n|Dec mean C = 23.7\n|year mean C = 18.2\n|Jan low C = 18.5\n|Feb low C = 17.5\n|Mar low C = 16.4\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 9.4\n|Jun low C = 6.3\n|Jul low C = 5.5\n|Aug low C = 7.3\n|Sep low C = 9.5\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 15.6\n|Dec low C = 17.9\n|year low C = 12.5\n|Jan record low C = 7.6\n|Feb record low C = 7.5\n|Mar record low C = 2.5\n|Apr record low C = -0.5\n|May record low C = -4.3\n|Jun record low C = -6.1\n|Jul record low C = -7.1\n|Aug record low C = -4.9\n|Sep record low C = -2.6\n|Oct record low C = 1.5\n|Nov record low C = 3.7\n|Dec record low C = 7.0\n|year record low C = -7.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 126.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 97.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 112.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 61.3\n|May precipitation mm = 18.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 8.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 35.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 154.6\n|year precipitation mm = 814.0\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.3\n|Apr precipitation days = 7.1\n|May precipitation days = 5.0\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.8\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.6\n|Nov precipitation days = 10.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.7\n|year precipitation days = 88.6\n|Jan humidity = 66.3\n|Feb humidity = 69.5\n|Mar humidity = 72.6\n|Apr humidity = 72.3\n|May humidity = 71.4\n|Jun humidity = 70.1\n|Jul humidity = 65.5\n|Aug humidity = 58.0\n|Sep humidity = 55.9\n|Oct humidity = 58.0\n|Nov humidity = 60.3\n|Dec humidity = 63.6\n|year humidity = 65.3\n|Jan sun = 257.3\n|Feb sun = 229.6\n|Mar sun = 204.6\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 170.5\n|Jun sun = 150.0\n|Jul sun = 170.5\n|Aug sun = 204.6\n|Sep sun = 213.0\n|Oct sun = 238.7\n|Nov sun = 255.0\n|Dec sun = 251.1\n|year sun = 2533.9\n|Jan percentsun = 60\n|Feb percentsun = 62\n|Mar percentsun = 54\n|Apr percentsun = 55\n|May percentsun = 52\n|Jun percentsun = 49\n|Jul percentsun = 53\n|Aug percentsun = 60\n|Sep percentsun = 60\n|Oct percentsun = 60\n|Nov percentsun = 62\n|Dec percentsun = 57\n|year percentsun = 57\n|source 1 = [[Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (Argentina)|Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional]]<ref name = SMNclimatenormals>{{cite web\n| url = https://ssl.smn.gob.ar/dpd/observaciones/estadisticas.txt\n| title = Estad\u00edsticas Climatol\u00f3gicas Normales - per\u00edodo 1981-2010\n| publisher = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=SMNextremes>\n{{cite web\n |url          = https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |title        = Clima en la Argentina: Guia Clim\u00e1tica por C\u00f3rdoba Obs.\n |work         = Caracterizaci\u00f3n: Estad\u00edsticas de largo plazo\n |publisher    = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language     = Spanish\n |accessdate   = 5 October 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904022616/https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |archive-date = 4 September 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/AG/87345.TXT\n| title = CORDOBA OBS Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Ingeniero Aeron\u00e1utico Ambrosio L.V.

From the rest of [[Western Europe]] came immigrants from [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]). [[Eastern Europeans]] also arrived from nations such as [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Armenia]] and the [[Balkans]] (especially [[Greece]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]).

This ended the construction of the 47&nbsp;km long ring road motorway, which takes almost 34 minutes to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lavoz.com.ar/videos/circunvalacion-completa-rodear-ciudad-de-cordoba-demanda-34-minutos|title=Circunvalaci\u00f3n completa: rodear la ciudad de C\u00f3rdoba demanda 34 minutos|publisher=LaVoz|date=6 July 2019|language=es|access-date=1 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Districts===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cordoba Skyline.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Panorama of the Nueva C\u00f3rdoba Skyline.]] -->\nC\u00f3rdoba is home to one of the most important financial districts in South America. The district is home to the Bank of C\u00f3rdoba and other private banking institutions. Sightseeing places include San Mart\u00edn Square, the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of C\u00f3rdoba|Jesuit Block]] (declared UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]) and the Genaro P\u00e9rez Museum. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern, and the main thoroughfares are V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, Col\u00f3n, General Paz, Dean Funes Avenue, and 27 April Street. The point of origin of the city is the San Martin Square, surrounded by the Municipality and Central Post Office.\n\nDowntown C\u00f3rdoba is home of large shopping malls, notably [[Patio Olmos]]. This mall is the result of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural point of interest is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the [[French architecture|French architect]], [[Ernest Sanson]]. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum|Evita Per\u00f3n Museum of Fine Arts]] (the city's second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city's principal art gallery.\n\n[[New C\u00f3rdoba]] has a number of important avenues such as ''Yrigoyen'' and ''V\u00e9lez Sarsfield''. Most of the university students in this growing city live in this neighbourhood, and a recent construction boom has been transforming this upscale area into the fastest-growing section in the city.\n\n[[File:Puente parque de las tejas.JPG|thumb|Tejas Park at New C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nCiudad Universitaria is a district located in the southern area of the city, next to the {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off}} [[Sarmiento Park]], the city's most important one. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] (UNC) has most of its facilities in this area. The UNC was the first university built in [[Argentina]], founded by Jesuits around 1622. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] is also famous for the \"Reforma Universitaria\", a student-led protest that started in March 1918 in the Medical School, in which the students rebelled against the prevailing university system. This was an old anachronistic system in which professors were authoritarian and inefficient, with a religiously oriented curriculum. Eventually this revolt lead to a more secular curriculum and some significant re-structuring of the university government. The distinctive nature of the movement derived not only from its radical demands, but also from its extremist tactics, the level of sophistication of its organization, and its major continental impact. In fact, the Reform Movement rapidly spread from C\u00f3rdoba to [[Lima]] (1919), Cuzco (1920), Santiago de Chile (1920), and Mexico (1921). Another important university, the [[National Technological University|UTN]], dedicated to the teaching of engineering sciences, is located in this part of the city. There are also a gym and football stadium and tennis courts for the students. The ''C\u00f3rdoba Zoo'' is located in this district.\n\nLocated about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from downtown C\u00f3rdoba is the Cerro de Las Rosas. This very affluent neighborhood is famous for its schools, shops and educational institutions. This neighborhood's economic activity centers around the Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez Avenue, a long wide road that stretches for a few kilometers and has restaurants, boutiques, banks and other shops. Over the last decade, this neighborhood has experienced steady growth; however, some of its most affluent inhabitants have moved to gated communities for security reasons. Some of these communities, such as \"Las Delicias\" and \"Lomas de los Carolinos\", are in the old Camino a La Calera.\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe C\u00f3rdoba public transport system includes [[rail transport|trains]], [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[taxi]]s. Long-distance buses reach most cities and towns throughout the country.\n\nThe city is served by the nation's third largest airport [[Ingeniero Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport]].\n\n=== Buses ===\nBuses are, by far, the most popular way of transportation around C\u00f3rdoba Province. There are many different companies that provide long distance, short distance and urban services. They all have their own prices, that are not cheap compared to the rest of Argentina.

Additionally, starting in 2017\u20132018, [[Nissan]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] will begin the production of their new pickup truck at the [[Renault]] factory. Railway construction ([[Materfer]]) and aircraft construction ([[F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones]]) were once significant employers, but their activities have greatly diminished. Furthermore, there are some textile, heavy and chemical industries (e.g. [[Porta Hermanos S.A.|Porta]] for alcohol).\n\nAreas around C\u00f3rdoba produce vast amounts of agricultural products, and some of these are processed around the city. Additionally, the province is one of the main producers of agricultural machinery in the country, although most of these operations are not in the city itself. Candy company [[Grupo Arcor|Arcor]] is headquartered in the city.\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has been considered the technological centre of Argentina. The Argentine ''spaceport'' (Centro Espacial Te\u00f3filo Tabanera), where [[satellite]]s are being developed and operated for [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|CONAE]], is located in the suburb of Falda del Carmen. The software and electronic industries are advancing and becoming significant exporters; among the leading local employers in the sector are [[Motorola]], Vates, [[Intel]], [[Electronic Data Systems]], and Santex Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThe city also has a service-based economy focused on retail, professional services (with companies like [[Deloitte]]) and financial services, where the main local player is credit card provider Tarjeta Naranja. It has recently emerged as a start-up hub with a growing number of angel investors, in part due to the availability of people with technology-oriented skills.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in C\u00f3rdoba as well as in Argentina.

Among the most popular cuarteto singers are [[La Mona Jim\u00e9nez|Carlos ''La Mona'' Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Rodrigo (musician)|Rodrigo]], La Barra and Jean Carlos. The places they usually sing are named ''bailes'' (dances). One of the first groups was ''Cuarteto de Oro''.\n\nOther music styles popular with the youth are [[electronic music]] (or ''electro''), as well as [[reggaeton]]. These are commonly played at ''boliches'', as night clubs are known in Argentina. C\u00f3rdoba is sometimes referred to as \"the nightlife city\" (or \"the city that never sleeps\"), because of its wide range of clubs and teenage ''matin\u00e9es'' (dancing clubs).\n\nC\u00f3rdoba's rich musical culture also encompasses [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], rock and pop, in a variety of venues.\n\n[[Libertador Theatre|Teatro Libertador San Mart\u00edn]] regularly features concerts, operas, folk music, and plays.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:La Ca\u00f1ada de C\u00f3rdoba 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|[[Ca\u00f1ada of C\u00f3rdoba|La Ca\u00f1ada]] (an embanked stream), perhaps the most emblematic structure in C\u00f3rdoba.]]\n[[File:Catedral de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina)|The Cathedral]] appeared as a project in the first map of C\u00f3rdoba in 1577.]]\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments left over from the colonial era.

The Jesuit Block, the Monserrat School, the University and the church of the Society of Jesus are also located in C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe first festival of the year is in February, the ''[[Carnival]]'', where children enjoy throwing water balloons at each other on the street.\n\nThen in the middle of the year, on 20 July, ''Friends Day'' is celebrated. Usually, most of the teenagers meet at ''Parque de las Naciones'' or ''Parque Sarmiento'' and spend the afternoon there. At night, they go dancing to different places, and enjoy a drink.\n\nThe last festival is ''Spring Day'', held on 21 September, which is Students' Day. Many go to the park or spend the day in the nearby city of [[Villa Carlos Paz]]. There they can enjoy lots of activities like concerts, dancing, going downtown or visiting the river bank.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Arco de C\u00f3rdoba 2007-11-16.jpg|The C\u00f3rdoba Gateway\nFile:Parque Sarmiento, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 1.jpg|[[Sarmiento Park]]\nFile:Av.

It is the capital of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] and the [[List of cities in Argentina by population|second most populous]] city in Argentina after Buenos Aires, with about 1.3 million inhabitants according to the 2010 census. It was founded on 6 July 1573 by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], who named it after [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. It was one of the first Spanish colonial capitals of the region that is now Argentina (the oldest city is [[Santiago del Estero]], founded in 1553). The [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]] is the oldest university of the country and the seventh to be inaugurated in [[Spanish America]]. It was founded in 1613 by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. Because of this, C\u00f3rdoba earned the nickname ''La Docta'' (\"the learned\").\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments preserved from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial rule]], especially buildings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The most recognizable is perhaps the [[Jesuit Block]] (Spanish: ''Manzana Jesu\u00edtica''), declared in 2000 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=995 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2000-11-30 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> which consists of a group of buildings dating from the 17th century, including the [[Colegio Nacional de Monserrat]] and the colonial university campus. The campus belongs today to the historical museum of the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], which has been the second-largest university in the country since the early 20th century (after the [[University of Buenos Aires]]), in number of students, faculty, and academic programs. C\u00f3rdoba is also known for its historical movements, such as [[Cordobazo]] and La Reforma del '18 (known as [[University Revolution]] in English).\n\n==History==\n===First settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn 1570, Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] entrusted the Spanish settler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]], with the task of populating and founding a settlement in the [[Punilla Valley]]. Cabrera sent an expedition of 48 men to the territory of the [[Comechingones]]. He divided the principal column that entered through the north of the provincial territory at [[Villa Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Villa Mar\u00eda]].\nThe one hundred man expedition set foot on what today is C\u00f3rdoba on 24 June 1573. Cabrera called the nearby river San Juan (today [[Suqu\u00eda]]). The settlement was officially founded on 6 July of the same year and named C\u00f3rdoba de la Nueva Andaluc\u00eda, possibly in honour of ancestors of the founder's wife, originally from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain]]. The foundation of the city took place on the left bank of the river on Francisco de Torres' advice.\n[[File:Primera traza de C\u00f3rdoba.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the first map of C\u00f3rdoba (1577)]]\n\nThe settlement was inhabited by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|aboriginal people]] called [[Comechingones]], who lived in communities called Ayllus. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement's authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suqu\u00eda River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa, planned the first layout of the city as a grid of seventy blocks. Once the city core had been moved to its current location, it acquired a stable population. Its economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.\n\nIn 1599, the religious order of the [[Jesuits]] arrived in the settlement. They established a [[Novitiate]] in 1608 and, in 1610, the Colegio Maximo, which became the University of C\u00f3rdoba in 1613 (today [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]]), the fourth-oldest in the Americas. The local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Church remains one of the oldest buildings in South America and contains the Monserrat Secondary School, a church, and residential buildings. To maintain such a project, the Jesuits operated five ''[[Jesuit Reductions|Reducciones]]'' in the surrounding fertile valleys, including Caroya, [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda]], Santa Catalina, [[Alta Gracia]] and Candelaria.\n\nThe farm and the complex, started in 1615, had to be vacated by the Jesuits following the 1767 decree by King [[Charles III of Spain]] that expelled them from the continent. They were then run by the [[Franciscan]]s until 1853, when the Jesuits returned to the Americas. Nevertheless, the university and the high-school were nationalized a year later.\nEach [[Estancia]] has its own church and set of buildings, around which towns grew, such as [[Alta Gracia]], the closest to the Block.\n\n===Early European settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Rafael de Sobremonte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael de Sobremonte, 3rd Marquis of Sobremonte|Rafael de Sobremonte]], governor of C\u00f3rdoba from 1784 to 1799]]\n\nIn 1776, [[King Carlos III]] created the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], in which C\u00f3rdoba stays in 1785 as the Government Intendency of C\u00f3rdoba, including the current territories of the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba, [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] and the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]].\n\nAccording to the 1760 census, the population of the city was 22,000 inhabitants. During the May Revolution in 1810, the widespread opinion of the most notable citizens was of continuing respecting the orders of [[Fernando VII]], attitude assumed by the local authorities, which led to the [[Liniers Counter-revolution]]. This position was not shared by the [[Dean Funes|Dean Gregorio Funes]], who was adhering to the revolutionary ideas, beside supporting contact with [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli]].\n\nIn March 1816, the Argentine Congress met in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]] for an independence resolution. C\u00f3rdoba sent [[Eduardo P\u00e9rez Bulnes]], [[Settler|Jer\u00f3nimo Salguero de Cabrera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera]], and to the Canon of the cathedral Michael Calixto of the Circle, all of them of autonomous position.\n\nThe 1820s belonged to [[caudillos]], since the country was in full process of formation. Until 1820 a central government taken root in Buenos Aires existed, but the remaining thirteen provinces felt that after 9 July 1816 what had happened it was simply a change of commander. The Battle of Cepeda pitted the commanders of the Littoral against the inland forces.\n\nFinally, the Federales obtained the victory, for what the country remained since then integrated by 13 autonomous provinces, on the national government having been dissolved.\nFrom this way the period known like about the Provincial Autonomies began. From this moment the provinces tried to create a [[Federal government|federal]] system that was integrating them without coming to good port, this mainly for the regional differences of every province.\n\nTwo C\u00f3rdoba figures stood out in this period: Governor Juan Bautista Bustos, who was an official of the Army of the North and in 1820 was supervised by the troops quartered in Arequito, a town near C\u00f3rdoba, and his ally and later enemy, General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Paz]]. In 1821, Bustos repelled the invasion of C\u00f3rdoba on the part of Francisco Ram\u00edrez and his [[Chile]]an ally, General [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]]. The conflict originated in a dispute with the power system that included the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], C\u00f3rdoba and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]; according to the 1822 census the total population of C\u00f3rdoba was of 11,552 inhabitants.\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:Avenida Col\u00f3n de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina) a\u00f1os 1900.png|thumb|Col\u00f3n Avenue, c. 1900.]]\n[[File:Avenida Olmos, C\u00f3rdoba (1943).jpg|thumb|Olmos Avenue (1943).]]\n[[File:Mapa relieve cordoba argentina.png|thumb|Topographical relief map of the city of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the process of national industrialization began with the height of the economic agro-exporting model, principally of meats and cereals. This process is associated with the [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigration]] who began to settle the city, generally possessing the education and enterprising capacity appropriate for the development of industry. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy (initially from [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]]; later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]]), and Spain (mostly [[Galicians]] and [[Basques]])\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the city had 90,000 inhabitants. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The city's physiognomy changed considerably following the construction of new avenues, walks and public squares, as well as the installation of an electrified tram system, in 1909. In 1918, C\u00f3rdoba was the epicentre of a movement known as the [[University reform in Argentina|University Reform]], which then spread to the rest of the Universities of the country, Americas and [[Spain]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe development of the domestic market, the [[English settlement in Argentina|British investments]] that facilitated European settlement, the development of the railways on the [[pampas]] rapidly industrialized the city. C\u00f3rdoba's industrial sector first developed from the need to transform [[raw materials]] such as leather, [[meats]] and [[wool]] for export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |title=Cordoba.gov: ciudad hist\u00f3rica Ciudad Historica |publisher=Cordoba.gov.ar |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2014-04-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003125609/http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, the Military Aircraft Manufacturer (FMA) was inaugurated. The facility would become one of the most important in the world after [[World War II]] with the arrival of German technical personnel. From 1952, its production began to diversify, to constitute the base of the former Institute Aerot\u00e9cnico, the state-owned company Aeronautical and Mechanical Industries of the State (IAME). C\u00f3rdoba was chosen as the site of The ''Instituto Aerot\u00e9cnico'' that later became the ''F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones''. It employed the Focke Wulf men until President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] was ousted by a [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|coup in 1955]]. [[Lockheed Martin]] purchased FMA in 1995.\n\nC\u00f3rdoba, according to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province's total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning C\u00f3rdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city's population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living standards rose with the increase in the national consumption of C\u00f3rdoba's industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nAt times rivaling Buenos Aires for its importance in national politics, C\u00f3rdoba was the site of the initial mutiny leading to the 1955 ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that deposed President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and the setting for the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'', a series of violent labor and student protests that ultimately led to [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elections in 1973]]. C\u00f3rdoba's current economic diversity is due to a vigorous services sector and the demand for agro-industrial and railway equipment and, in particular, the introduction of U.S. and European automakers after 1954.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Location of Cordoba City Argentina.svg|thumb|Location of C\u00f3rdoba.<br />1.

Summers run from late November till early March, and bring days between {{convert|28|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and night between {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} with frequent thunderstorms. Heat waves are common, and bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and hot, sticky nights; however, Pampero winds are sure to bring relief with thunderstorms and a day or two of cool, crisp weather: nighttime temperatures can easily descend to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or less, but the heat starts building up right away the next day.\n\nBy late February or early March, nights start getting cooler and, in March, highs average {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and lows {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}; after cold fronts, lows below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and highs below {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are recorded in this month.\nApril is significantly drier already; highs reach {{convert|24|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} on average and lows {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, creating very pleasant conditions. In some years, temperatures can approach or even reach the freezing point in late April; however, heat waves of up to {{convert|33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} are still possible, but nights are rarely as hot as in the summer.\nMay usually brings the first frosts, and very dry weather, with under {{convert|20|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain expected.

However, strong northwesterly winds downsloping from the mountains can bring what is known as \"Veranito\" (little summer) with highs of up to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or more and dusty, windy weather (but dry, pleasant nights) for 2\u20133 days. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Conversely, when storms stall over the Atlantic coast, there may be several days of drizzle and cool weather, and when cold air masses invade the country from Antarctica (several times every winter), there may be one or two days with temperatures around {{convert|6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, drizzle and high winds (which combined make it feel very cold), followed by dry, cold weather with nighttime lows between {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and daytime highs between {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.

The record low temperature for C\u00f3rdoba is {{convert|-8.3|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. In June, only {{convert|3.5|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain are expected, compared to {{convert|168|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January.\n\nSpring is extremely variable and windy: there may be long stretches of cool, dry weather and cold nights followed by intense heat waves up to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, followed by the most severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds. It is not unusual to see temperatures drop {{convert|20|C-change|0|abbr=on}} from one day to another, or to have frost following extreme heat. Drought is most common in this season, when the normal summer rainfall arrives later than expected.\nBy October, days are warm at {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but nights remain cold at {{convert|11|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, by late November, the weather resembles summer weather with cooler nights.\n\nThe wealthier suburbs west of the city are located at slightly higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, C\u00f3rdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity and the possibility of fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.\n\nThe variations or thermal extents are greater than in Buenos Aires, and lower in annual rainfall: {{convert|750|mm|0|abbr=on}} / year. The annual average temperature calculated during the 20th century was 18&nbsp;\u00b0C. In January, the hottest month of the austral summer, the average maximum is 31&nbsp;\u00b0C and the minimum 17&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn July, the coldest month of the year, the average temperatures are between 19&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIn winter it is very frequent that temperatures rise above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C, due to the influence of the wind Zonda.\n\nDue to the extension of the [[metropolitan area]], there exists a difference of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C between the central area and the Greater C\u00f3rdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important [[heat island]]. In addition the city presents a phenomenon of smog, but not so dense as to present health concerns.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = C\u00f3rdoba Observatory, C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina (1981\u20132010, extremes 1961\u2013present)\n|single line = y\n|metric first = y\n|collapsed = y\n|Jan record high C = 41.6\n|Feb record high C = 41.2\n|Mar record high C = 39.4\n|Apr record high C = 36.2\n|May record high C = 35.5\n|Jun record high C = 32.8\n|Jul record high C = 34.3\n|Aug record high C = 38.2\n|Sep record high C = 41.1\n|Oct record high C = 42.0\n|Nov record high C = 41.5\n|Dec record high C = 43.5\n|year record high C = 43.5\n|Jan high C = 30.9\n|Feb high C = 29.6\n|Mar high C = 28.1\n|Apr high C = 24.8\n|May high C = 21.3\n|Jun high C = 18.7\n|Jul high C = 18.3\n|Aug high C = 21.1\n|Sep high C = 23.2\n|Oct high C = 26.6\n|Nov high C = 28.7\n|Dec high C = 30.3\n|year high C = 25.1\n|Jan mean C = 24.3\n|Feb mean C = 23.1\n|Mar mean C = 21.7\n|Apr mean C = 18.0\n|May mean C = 14.5\n|Jun mean C = 11.4\n|Jul mean C = 10.8\n|Aug mean C = 13.3\n|Sep mean C = 15.7\n|Oct mean C = 19.5\n|Nov mean C = 21.8\n|Dec mean C = 23.7\n|year mean C = 18.2\n|Jan low C = 18.5\n|Feb low C = 17.5\n|Mar low C = 16.4\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 9.4\n|Jun low C = 6.3\n|Jul low C = 5.5\n|Aug low C = 7.3\n|Sep low C = 9.5\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 15.6\n|Dec low C = 17.9\n|year low C = 12.5\n|Jan record low C = 7.6\n|Feb record low C = 7.5\n|Mar record low C = 2.5\n|Apr record low C = -0.5\n|May record low C = -4.3\n|Jun record low C = -6.1\n|Jul record low C = -7.1\n|Aug record low C = -4.9\n|Sep record low C = -2.6\n|Oct record low C = 1.5\n|Nov record low C = 3.7\n|Dec record low C = 7.0\n|year record low C = -7.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 126.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 97.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 112.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 61.3\n|May precipitation mm = 18.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 8.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 35.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 154.6\n|year precipitation mm = 814.0\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.3\n|Apr precipitation days = 7.1\n|May precipitation days = 5.0\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.8\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 2.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 4.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 7.6\n|Nov precipitation days = 10.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.7\n|year precipitation days = 88.6\n|Jan humidity = 66.3\n|Feb humidity = 69.5\n|Mar humidity = 72.6\n|Apr humidity = 72.3\n|May humidity = 71.4\n|Jun humidity = 70.1\n|Jul humidity = 65.5\n|Aug humidity = 58.0\n|Sep humidity = 55.9\n|Oct humidity = 58.0\n|Nov humidity = 60.3\n|Dec humidity = 63.6\n|year humidity = 65.3\n|Jan sun = 257.3\n|Feb sun = 229.6\n|Mar sun = 204.6\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 170.5\n|Jun sun = 150.0\n|Jul sun = 170.5\n|Aug sun = 204.6\n|Sep sun = 213.0\n|Oct sun = 238.7\n|Nov sun = 255.0\n|Dec sun = 251.1\n|year sun = 2533.9\n|Jan percentsun = 60\n|Feb percentsun = 62\n|Mar percentsun = 54\n|Apr percentsun = 55\n|May percentsun = 52\n|Jun percentsun = 49\n|Jul percentsun = 53\n|Aug percentsun = 60\n|Sep percentsun = 60\n|Oct percentsun = 60\n|Nov percentsun = 62\n|Dec percentsun = 57\n|year percentsun = 57\n|source 1 = [[Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (Argentina)|Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional]]<ref name = SMNclimatenormals>{{cite web\n| url = https://ssl.smn.gob.ar/dpd/observaciones/estadisticas.txt\n| title = Estad\u00edsticas Climatol\u00f3gicas Normales - per\u00edodo 1981-2010\n| publisher = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=SMNextremes>\n{{cite web\n |url          = https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |title        = Clima en la Argentina: Guia Clim\u00e1tica por C\u00f3rdoba Obs.\n |work         = Caracterizaci\u00f3n: Estad\u00edsticas de largo plazo\n |publisher    = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language     = Spanish\n |accessdate   = 5 October 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904022616/https://www2.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo\n |archive-date = 4 September 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/AG/87345.TXT\n| title = CORDOBA OBS Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Ingeniero Aeron\u00e1utico Ambrosio L.V.

From the rest of [[Western Europe]] came immigrants from [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]). [[Eastern Europeans]] also arrived from nations such as [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Armenia]] and the [[Balkans]] (especially [[Greece]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]).

This is almost the maximum distance from the Buenos Aires city center to the most distant of its metropolitan area points; whereas in the rest of the cardinal points it comes to {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe city receives a constant flow of students from the North-East, Southwest regions of Argentina and of other [[South American]] countries, owed principally to the National University of C\u00f3rdoba, which increases gradually the city population. C\u00f3rdoba grows constantly, expanding especially towards the southern areas of [[Alta Gracia]] and [[Villa Carlos Paz]].\n\n{| class=\"sortable toc\" style=\"text-align:center; clear:all; margin-right:10px; font-size:85%\"\n! colspan=\"14\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Demographic Evolution<ref name=\"guiasestadisticas01\">\n{{cite web\n | url= http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/Docs/observatorio/guia07/CAPITULO3_07.pdf\n | title = Observatorio urbano \u2013 Gu\u00edas estad\u00edsticas: Cap\u00edtulo III: Demograf\u00eda.\n | accessdate =15 Oct 2008\n | year = 2007\n | publisher=Municipalidad de C\u00f3rdoba.\n | language = Spanish}}\n</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" |\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1810\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1869\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1895\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1914\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1947\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1960\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1970\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1980\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 1991\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 2001\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | 2010\n|-\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | Population\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 9,080\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 34,458\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 54,763\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 134,935\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 386,828\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 586,015\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 801,771\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 990,968\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 1,179,372\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 1,284,582\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 1,330,023<ref name=\"censo2008\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.lavoz.com.ar/ciudadanos/censo-2010-en-argentina-somos-40091359-y-en-cordoba-3304825 |title = Censo 2010.\n|accessdate =6 February 2010\n|publisher=La Voz del Interior\n|language = Spanish}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background: #497CDA; color:white;\" | Annual population growth rate\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"|\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 2.3\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 1.8\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 4.9\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 3.2\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 3.2\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 3.2\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 2.1\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 1.6\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 0.9\n| style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 0.4\n|}\n\n==Urban structure ==\n[[File:Area segun uso del suelo cordoba argentina.svg|thumb|Land use map of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\nThe use of the city soil is regulated by the municipality, which determines and destines 26,177 hectares to urban area (40.24%), 12,267 hectares to the industrial dominant area (21.3%), 16,404 hectares to rural area dominant (28.45%) and 5,750 hectares to other uses as military proposes, or institutional spaces (9.98%) of the total area of the city.<ref name=\"catastro02\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=55_4\n |title=Datos territoriales de C\u00f3rdoba\n |accessdate=2 August 2008\n |year=2007\n |language=Spanish\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925073953/http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=55_4\n |archivedate=25 September 2008\n}}\n</ref>\n\nGreen spaces include different types of spaces, from squares, small squares, up to urban, green linear parks of different scales as the [[River|river Suquia]], bicycle pathways and highways).

The district is home to the Bank of C\u00f3rdoba and other private banking institutions. Sightseeing places include San Mart\u00edn Square, the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of C\u00f3rdoba|Jesuit Block]] (declared UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]) and the Genaro P\u00e9rez Museum. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern, and the main thoroughfares are V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, Col\u00f3n, General Paz, Dean Funes Avenue, and 27 April Street. The point of origin of the city is the San Martin Square, surrounded by the Municipality and Central Post Office.\n\nDowntown C\u00f3rdoba is home of large shopping malls, notably [[Patio Olmos]]. This mall is the result of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural point of interest is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the [[French architecture|French architect]], [[Ernest Sanson]]. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum|Evita Per\u00f3n Museum of Fine Arts]] (the city's second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city's principal art gallery.\n\n[[New C\u00f3rdoba]] has a number of important avenues such as ''Yrigoyen'' and ''V\u00e9lez Sarsfield''. Most of the university students in this growing city live in this neighbourhood, and a recent construction boom has been transforming this upscale area into the fastest-growing section in the city.\n\n[[File:Puente parque de las tejas.JPG|thumb|Tejas Park at New C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nCiudad Universitaria is a district located in the southern area of the city, next to the {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off}} [[Sarmiento Park]], the city's most important one. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] (UNC) has most of its facilities in this area. The UNC was the first university built in [[Argentina]], founded by Jesuits around 1622. The [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]] is also famous for the \"Reforma Universitaria\", a student-led protest that started in March 1918 in the Medical School, in which the students rebelled against the prevailing university system. This was an old anachronistic system in which professors were authoritarian and inefficient, with a religiously oriented curriculum. Eventually this revolt lead to a more secular curriculum and some significant re-structuring of the university government. The distinctive nature of the movement derived not only from its radical demands, but also from its extremist tactics, the level of sophistication of its organization, and its major continental impact. In fact, the Reform Movement rapidly spread from C\u00f3rdoba to [[Lima]] (1919), Cuzco (1920), Santiago de Chile (1920), and Mexico (1921). Another important university, the [[National Technological University|UTN]], dedicated to the teaching of engineering sciences, is located in this part of the city. There are also a gym and football stadium and tennis courts for the students. The ''C\u00f3rdoba Zoo'' is located in this district.\n\nLocated about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from downtown C\u00f3rdoba is the Cerro de Las Rosas. This very affluent neighborhood is famous for its schools, shops and educational institutions. This neighborhood's economic activity centers around the Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez Avenue, a long wide road that stretches for a few kilometers and has restaurants, boutiques, banks and other shops. Over the last decade, this neighborhood has experienced steady growth; however, some of its most affluent inhabitants have moved to gated communities for security reasons. Some of these communities, such as \"Las Delicias\" and \"Lomas de los Carolinos\", are in the old Camino a La Calera.\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe C\u00f3rdoba public transport system includes [[rail transport|trains]], [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[taxi]]s. Long-distance buses reach most cities and towns throughout the country.\n\nThe city is served by the nation's third largest airport [[Ingeniero Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport]].\n\n=== Buses ===\nBuses are, by far, the most popular way of transportation around C\u00f3rdoba Province. There are many different companies that provide long distance, short distance and urban services. They all have their own prices, that are not cheap compared to the rest of Argentina.

Additionally, starting in 2017\u20132018, [[Nissan]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] will begin the production of their new pickup truck at the [[Renault]] factory. Railway construction ([[Materfer]]) and aircraft construction ([[F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones]]) were once significant employers, but their activities have greatly diminished. Furthermore, there are some textile, heavy and chemical industries (e.g. [[Porta Hermanos S.A.|Porta]] for alcohol).\n\nAreas around C\u00f3rdoba produce vast amounts of agricultural products, and some of these are processed around the city.

These are commonly played at ''boliches'', as night clubs are known in Argentina. C\u00f3rdoba is sometimes referred to as \"the nightlife city\" (or \"the city that never sleeps\"), because of its wide range of clubs and teenage ''matin\u00e9es'' (dancing clubs).\n\nC\u00f3rdoba's rich musical culture also encompasses [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], rock and pop, in a variety of venues.\n\n[[Libertador Theatre|Teatro Libertador San Mart\u00edn]] regularly features concerts, operas, folk music, and plays.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:La Ca\u00f1ada de C\u00f3rdoba 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|[[Ca\u00f1ada of C\u00f3rdoba|La Ca\u00f1ada]] (an embanked stream), perhaps the most emblematic structure in C\u00f3rdoba.]]\n[[File:Catedral de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina)|The Cathedral]] appeared as a project in the first map of C\u00f3rdoba in 1577.]]\n\nC\u00f3rdoba has many historical monuments left over from the colonial era. In the centre, near the ''Plaza San Mart\u00edn'' square, is the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral|Cathedral]], whose altar is made of stone and silver from [[Potos\u00ed]]. Every ornament inside is made of gold and the roof is all painted with different images from the Bible. Another important historic building is the ''[[C\u00f3rdoba Cabildo|Cabildo]]'' (colonial government house), located next to the church. The Jesuit Block, the Monserrat School, the University and the church of the Society of Jesus are also located in C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe first festival of the year is in February, the ''[[Carnival]]'', where children enjoy throwing water balloons at each other on the street.\n\nThen in the middle of the year, on 20 July, ''Friends Day'' is celebrated. Usually, most of the teenagers meet at ''Parque de las Naciones'' or ''Parque Sarmiento'' and spend the afternoon there. At night, they go dancing to different places, and enjoy a drink.\n\nThe last festival is ''Spring Day'', held on 21 September, which is Students' Day. Many go to the park or spend the day in the nearby city of [[Villa Carlos Paz]]. There they can enjoy lots of activities like concerts, dancing, going downtown or visiting the river bank.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Arco de C\u00f3rdoba 2007-11-16.jpg|The C\u00f3rdoba Gateway\nFile:Parque Sarmiento, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina 1.jpg|[[Sarmiento Park]]\nFile:Av.
