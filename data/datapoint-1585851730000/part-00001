He played a total of 36 league games for the Rams, before leaving to join [[Torquay United]] in June 1962 for a fee of \u00a31,000 as a replacement for the released [[Eddie Marsh (footballer)|Eddie Marsh]]. He began the following season as first choice, making his debut away to [[Exeter City]] on 18 August 1962, keeping a clean sheet as the Gulls won 3\u20130 thanks to an [[Ernie Pym]] hat-trick, and remained a regular for the next three and a half seasons, before breaking a finger and losing his place initially to [[Mike Turner (footballer)|Mike Turner]] and then to [[Gary McGuire]].\n\nIn a 1963 [[FA cup]] game against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] he scored a goal, an unusual feat for a goalkeeper.
