It first aired on [[CBC Television]] in 1992 and was [[television syndication|syndicated]] around the world. It is set in the fictional community of Lynx River, a primarily Native-run town depicted as being in the [[Dehcho Region]], [[Northwest Territories]].\n\nMost of the characters were [[Dene]]. Some non-native characters had important roles: the restaurant/motel owner, the band manager, the nurse and (during the show's first season) the town's main [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officer. The show explored themes of Native poverty, alcoholism, cultural preservation, conflict over land settlements, and natural resource exploitation.\n\nOriginally somewhat light-hearted (a CBC response to the very successful ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' on CBS), it quickly became a more ponderous dramatic series.\n\n==Casting==\nStarring in the series were [[Tina Keeper]] as RCMP Constable, later Corporal, Michelle Kenidi, Tracey Cook as Sarah Birkett (nurse during first year), [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]] as Peter Kenidi (band chief in first year, Michelle's brother), [[Gordon Tootoosis]] as Albert Golo (bootlegger, then band chief), Dakota House as Trevor 'Teevee' Tenia (teen trouble-maker, then band chief), Lubomir Mykytiuk as Gerry Kisilenko (restaurant/motel owner/justice of the peace), [[Jimmy Herman]] as Joe Gomba (elder) and [[Simon R. Baker]] as Charlie Muskrat. [[Adam Beach]] and [[Tantoo Cardinal]] also starred. Elsie Tsa Che ([[Wilma Pelly]]) was a fan favorite, playing Teevee's grandmother, a community elder. [[John Oliver (actor)|John Oliver]] led the cast as Corporal Eric Olsen during the show's first two seasons and entered into an off-screen relationship with co-star Keeper; he left the show when his relationship with Keeper soured. Keeper subsequently became the show's lead actor for the remainder of its run. Oliver was replaced by [[Robert Bockstael (actor)|Robert Bockstael]] as Corporal Brian Fletcher, who was replaced later by Peter Kelly Gaudreault as Constable James Harper.\n\nOne of the stars was [[Michael Horse]], as Andrew One Sky, previously best known for his portrayal of Tonto in the 1981 film ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]''. Tom Jackson also performed as Billy Twofeathers on ''[[Shining Time Station]]''. \n\n===List of characters===\n{{expand list|date=July 2012}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Character \n!
