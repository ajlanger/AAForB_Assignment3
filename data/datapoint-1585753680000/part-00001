Both bombers were attacked by several Japanese fighters of both the [[302nd Naval Air Group]] at [[Atsugi]] and the [[Yokosuka]] Air Group that made 10 gunnery passes. Japanese [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|IJNAS]] [[Flying ace|ace]]s [[Sadamu Komachi]] and [[Sabur\u014d Sakai]] were part of this attack. The B-32 piloted by 1st Lt. John R. Anderson, was hit at 20,000 feet; cannon fire knocked out the number two (port inner) engine, and three crew were injured, including Sgt. Anthony J. Marchione, 19, of the [[20th Intelligence Squadron|20th Reconnaissance Squadron]], who took a 20&nbsp;mm hit to the chest and died 30 minutes later. Tail gunner Sgt. John Houston destroyed one attacker. The lead bomber, [[Consolidated B-32-20-CF Dominator]], ''42-108532'', \"Hobo Queen II\", piloted by 1st Lt. James Klein, was not seriously damaged but the second [[Consolidated B-32-35-CF Dominator]], ''42-108578'', lost an engine, had the upper turret knocked out of action, and partially lost rudder control. Both bombers landed at Yontan Airfield just past ~1800 hrs. having survived the last air combat of the Pacific war. The following day, propellers were removed from Japanese aircraft as part of the surrender agreement. Marchione was buried on Okinawa on 19 August, his body being returned to his [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]] home on 18 March 1949. He was interred in St. Aloysius Old Cemetery with full military honors.<ref>[http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/The_Last_to_Die.html?c=y&page=1 The Last to Die | Military Aviation | Air & Space Magazine].

The Americans lost eighty planes.\"{{sfnp |Hillenbrand |2010 | pp=273\u2013274 }}\n* 18 August 1945: The last U.S. air combat casualty of World War II occurred during mission 230 A-8, when two [[Consolidated B-32 Dominator]]s of the [[386th Bombardment Squadron|386th Bomb Squadron]], [[312th Bombardment Group|312th Bomb Group]], launched from [[Yontan Airfield]], Okinawa, for a photo reconnaissance run over [[Tokyo, Japan]]. Both bombers were attacked by several Japanese fighters of both the [[302nd Naval Air Group]] at [[Atsugi]] and the [[Yokosuka]] Air Group that made 10 gunnery passes. Japanese [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|IJNAS]] [[Flying ace|ace]]s [[Sadamu Komachi]] and [[Sabur\u014d Sakai]] were part of this attack. The B-32 piloted by 1st Lt. John R. Anderson, was hit at 20,000 feet; cannon fire knocked out the number two (port inner) engine, and three crew were injured, including Sgt. Anthony J. Marchione, 19, of the [[20th Intelligence Squadron|20th Reconnaissance Squadron]], who took a 20&nbsp;mm hit to the chest and died 30 minutes later. Tail gunner Sgt. John Houston destroyed one attacker. The lead bomber, [[Consolidated B-32-20-CF Dominator]], ''42-108532'', \"Hobo Queen II\", piloted by 1st Lt. James Klein, was not seriously damaged but the second [[Consolidated B-32-35-CF Dominator]], ''42-108578'', lost an engine, had the upper turret knocked out of action, and partially lost rudder control. Both bombers landed at Yontan Airfield just past ~1800 hrs. having survived the last air combat of the Pacific war. The following day, propellers were removed from Japanese aircraft as part of the surrender agreement. Marchione was buried on Okinawa on 19 August, his body being returned to his [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]] home on 18 March 1949. He was interred in St. Aloysius Old Cemetery with full military honors.<ref>[http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/The_Last_to_Die.html?c=y&page=1 The Last to Die | Military Aviation | Air & Space Magazine].
