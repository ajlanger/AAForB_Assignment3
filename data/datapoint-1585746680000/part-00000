Introduced animal species, data collection and monitoring are the main approaches taken in NSW in the effort to preserve the malleefowl.<ref>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage |date=2013|title=Iconic species project - Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/SavingOurSpecies/13537malleefowl.pdf|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany introduces species occur within the area and cause some alterations to the native species that inhabit the reserve.<ref name=pom/><ref name=bettongs>{{cite journal|author1=Priddel, D.|author2=Wheeler, R.|title=An experimental translocation of brush-tailed bettongs (Bettongia penicillata) to western New South Wales|journal=Wildlife Research|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|pages=421\u2013432|doi=10.1071/wr03050}}</ref>  The major introduced species are the European red fox (''[[Vulpes vulpes]]''), feral cats (''[[Felis catus]]''), feral dogs (''[[Canis lupus familiaris]]''), feral pigs (''[[Sus scrofa]]''), goat (''[[Capra hircus]]'') and rabit (''[[Oryctolagos cuniculus]]'').\n\n==Environmental hazards and threats==\n[[File:Feral goat browsing, Yathong Nature Reserve.jpg|thumb|Feral goat browsing in Yathong Nature Reserve]]\nThe occurrence of bushfire is the primary environmental hazard that poses a direct threat to the biodiversity of the reserve.<ref name=pom/>  The threat of fire has been listed as a Key Threatening Process (KTP) by the NSW Government as it would have a drastic effect on the \"loss of vegetation structure and composition\".<ref name=Fire>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|date=2014|title=High frequency fire resulting in the disruption of life cycle processes in plants and animals and loss of vegetation structure and composition - profile|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=20014|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>  The fire management plan is one that considers biodiversity and cultural heritage in the approach to managing fires. The size and age of the reserve allows for a greater capacity for drought and fire resistance, which is in part due to the age classes of existing vegetation.<ref name=pom/>\n\nThe second concern regarding threats comes from predation and encroachment of introduced species. Predation threats for the native species are a result of the feeding habits of the introduce feral animals. Both feral dogs and cats, for instance, pose threats to animal species within the reserve. Feral cat and fox predation on bird species is of particular concern for ground dwelling and nesting birds. Examples of the bird species that are vulnerable include; red-lored whistler (''[[Pachycephala rufogularis]]''), malleefowl (''[[Leipoa ocellata]]'') and striated grass wren (''[[Amytornis striatus]]'').<ref name=pom/>  Goats and rabbit species pose a risk to both the plant and animal communities through [[overgrazing]] and species competition. This is a raised concern where native animals may rely on a specific habitat such as the malleefowl. Competition, overgrazing and habitat destruction also comes from the three kangaroo species present within the reserve.\n\nIntroduced and invasive plant species also pose threats to the structure and range of plant communities. Species such as lantana (''[[Lantana camara]] L. sens. Lat''), bitou bush (''[[Chrysanthemoides monilifera]]'') and perennial grasses are a source of competition for native plant species.<ref name=Bionet />  Subsequent effects on the habit and the dependent native animal species raises concern for the spread of invasive species.\n\n==Reserve management==\nYathong Nature Reserve is managed by the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service]] (NPWS), an agency of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The management goals of the reserve plan are the protection of floral and faunal communities with wider consideration of natural and cultural heritage and public uses. The key areas for management will focus on native and introduced flora and fauna alongside considerations of fire management. The second area of concern regards the recognition of cultural and historic properties of the park. The [[Ngiyam]] and [[Wiradjuripaa]] people, traditional land owners, will be involved with works and activities that concern cultural values, heritage and important sites.<ref name=pom/> The development of information and knowledge of the reserve will draw from the knowledge that the traditional land owners possess.\n\nThe importance of the reserve has drawn interest from groups concerned with flora and fauna communities of the area. The Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife (FNPW) has been involved in the creation of the reserve and subsequent conservation activities, particularly of the malleefowl. The reserve is also listed in the [[Important Bird Area]] database, which contributes to monitoring the population's numbers and therefore aiding future protection and conservation efforts.\n\nManagement activities regarding threats mainly focus on controlling the effect of encroachment and predation by introduced species. Actions undertaken by the NPWS include targeted control plans for endangered and vulnerable native species. Baiting programs exist and target pest species such as foxes and feral dogs and cats.<ref name=Pest>{{cite web|work=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service|date= 2006|title=Upper Darling Region Pest Management Strategy 2003-2006|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/pestsweeds/finalPestMgmtStrategyUdr.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|environment}}}}\n* [[Protected areas of New South Wales]]\n*[[List of biosphere reserves in Australia]]\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite book|title=Yathong Nature Reserve, Nombinnie Nature Reserve and Round Hill Nature Reserve: Plan of management|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/pomFinalYathongNombinnieRoundhill.pdf|type=PDF|work=[[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=November 1996|isbn=0-7310-0845-6}}\n\n{{Nature reserves of New South Wales |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Nature reserves in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Biosphere reserves of Australia]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1971]]\n[[Category:1971 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Central West (New South Wales)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2012}}\n{{Infobox Australian place\n| type                   = protected\n| name                   = Yathong Nature Reserve\n| state                  = nsw\n| iucn_category          = Ia\n| image                  = Eucalyptus stricta - Woodford.jpg\n| caption                = Example of mallee vegetation\n| image_alt              = \n| relief                 = 1\n| coordinates            = {{coord|32|33|38.5|S|145|32|09.2|E|display=inline,title}}\n| map_alt                = \n| nearest_town_or_city   = {{NSWcity|Cobar}}\n| area                   = 1072.4\n| area_footnotes         = <ref name=oeh>{{cite web|title=Yathong Nature Reserve: Park management|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkManagement.aspx?id=N0497|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n| established            = {{start date|1971|04||df=y}} (NR); {{start date|1977|}} (MAB)\n| established_footnotes  = <ref name=oeh/><ref name=\"MAB\"/>\n| visitation_num         = \n| visitation_year        = \n| visitation_footnotes   = \n| managing_authorities   = [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service]]\n| url                    = http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0497\n}}\n\nThe '''Yathong Nature Reserve''' is a [[state park|protected]] [[nature reserve]] that is also a nationally and internationally recognized [[biosphere]] situated in the [[Central West (New South Wales)|central-western]] region of [[New South Wales]], in eastern [[Australia]].

J.|title=Conservation of the Mallee Fowl, Leipoa ocellata Gould (Megapodiidae)|journal=CSIRO Wildlife Research|date=1962|volume=7|pages=33\u201349|doi=10.1071/cwr9620033}}</ref>   Management strategies at the time of NPWS reserve plan included breeding programs alongside activities to reduce threatening processes and predatory species. A national recovery plan targeting a range of endangered species, not specific to the reserve, includes actions to protect and promote the malleefowl population.<ref>{{cite web|author=Benshemesh, J.|date=2007|title=National Recovery Plan for Malleefowl|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/dd346674-08ab-403d-8c11-5b88e8247e8f/files/malleefowl.pdf|type=PDF |work=Department for Environment and Heritage|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> The actions undertaken in NSW will comprise a variety of conservation and management activities. Introduced animal species, data collection and monitoring are the main approaches taken in NSW in the effort to preserve the malleefowl.<ref>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage |date=2013|title=Iconic species project - Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/SavingOurSpecies/13537malleefowl.pdf|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany introduces species occur within the area and cause some alterations to the native species that inhabit the reserve.<ref name=pom/><ref name=bettongs>{{cite journal|author1=Priddel, D.|author2=Wheeler, R.|title=An experimental translocation of brush-tailed bettongs (Bettongia penicillata) to western New South Wales|journal=Wildlife Research|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|pages=421\u2013432|doi=10.1071/wr03050}}</ref>  The major introduced species are the European red fox (''[[Vulpes vulpes]]''), feral cats (''[[Felis catus]]''), feral dogs (''[[Canis lupus familiaris]]''), feral pigs (''[[Sus scrofa]]''), goat (''[[Capra hircus]]'') and rabit (''[[Oryctolagos cuniculus]]'').\n\n==Environmental hazards and threats==\n\nThe occurrence of bushfire is the primary environmental hazard that poses a direct threat to the biodiversity of the reserve.<ref name=pom/>  The threat of fire has been listed as a Key Threatening Process (KTP) by the NSW Government as it would have a drastic effect on the \"loss of vegetation structure and composition\".<ref name=Fire>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|date=2014|title=High frequency fire resulting in the disruption of life cycle processes in plants and animals and loss of vegetation structure and composition - profile|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=20014|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>  The fire management plan is one that considers biodiversity and cultural heritage in the approach to managing fires. The size and age of the reserve allows for a greater capacity for drought and fire resistance, which is in part due to the age classes of existing vegetation.<ref name=pom/>\n\nThe second concern regarding threats comes from predation and encroachment of introduced species. Predation threats for the native species are a result of the feeding habits of the introduce feral animals. Both feral dogs and cats, for instance, pose threats to animal species within the reserve. Feral cat and fox predation on bird species is of particular concern for ground dwelling and nesting birds. Examples of the bird species that are vulnerable include; red-lored whistler (''[[Pachycephala rufogularis]]''), malleefowl (''[[Leipoa ocellata]]'') and striated grass wren (''[[Amytornis striatus]]'').<ref name=pom/>  Goats and rabbit species pose a risk to both the plant and animal communities through [[overgrazing]] and species competition. This is a raised concern where native animals may rely on a specific habitat such as the malleefowl. Competition, overgrazing and habitat destruction also comes from the three kangaroo species present within the reserve.\n\nIntroduced and invasive plant species also pose threats to the structure and range of plant communities. Species such as lantana (''[[Lantana camara]] L. sens. Lat''), bitou bush (''[[Chrysanthemoides monilifera]]'') and perennial grasses are a source of competition for native plant species.<ref name=Bionet />  Subsequent effects on the habit and the dependent native animal species raises concern for the spread of invasive species.\n\n==Reserve management==\nYathong Nature Reserve is managed by the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service]] (NPWS), an agency of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The management goals of the reserve plan are the protection of floral and faunal communities with wider consideration of natural and cultural heritage and public uses. The key areas for management will focus on native and introduced flora and fauna alongside considerations of fire management. The second area of concern regards the recognition of cultural and historic properties of the park. The [[Ngiyam]] and [[Wiradjuripaa]] people, traditional land owners, will be involved with works and activities that concern cultural values, heritage and important sites.<ref name=pom/> The development of information and knowledge of the reserve will draw from the knowledge that the traditional land owners possess.\n\nThe importance of the reserve has drawn interest from groups concerned with flora and fauna communities of the area. The Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife (FNPW) has been involved in the creation of the reserve and subsequent conservation activities, particularly of the malleefowl. The reserve is also listed in the [[Important Bird Area]] database, which contributes to monitoring the population's numbers and therefore aiding future protection and conservation efforts.\n\nManagement activities regarding threats mainly focus on controlling the effect of encroachment and predation by introduced species. Actions undertaken by the NPWS include targeted control plans for endangered and vulnerable native species. Baiting programs exist and target pest species such as foxes and feral dogs and cats.<ref name=Pest>{{cite web|work=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service|date= 2006|title=Upper Darling Region Pest Management Strategy 2003-2006|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/pestsweeds/finalPestMgmtStrategyUdr.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|environment}}}}\n* [[Protected areas of New South Wales]]\n*[[List of biosphere reserves in Australia]]\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite book|title=Yathong Nature Reserve, Nombinnie Nature Reserve and Round Hill Nature Reserve: Plan of management|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/pomFinalYathongNombinnieRoundhill.pdf|type=PDF|work=[[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=November 1996|isbn=0-7310-0845-6}}\n\n{{Nature reserves of New South Wales |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Nature reserves in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Biosphere reserves of Australia]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1971]]\n[[Category:1971 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Central West (New South Wales)]]\n", "name_user": "B 897", "label": "safe", "comment": "added image", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yathong_Nature_Reserve"}
