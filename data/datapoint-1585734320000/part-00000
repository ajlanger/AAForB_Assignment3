Each of these semi-circular arches had a span of {{Convert|9.1|m||order=flip}} and was supported upon [[tapering (mathematics)|tapered]] red brick piers.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> Each pier was almost divided into two separate halves by {{Convert|3|m||adj=on|order=flip}} vertical voids, capped by semi-circular rings at the top and base, as a weight-saving measure. This approach is credited with giving the structure a relatively slender appearance.<ref name = \"eng time\" /><ref name = \"lloyd bath\" /> The foundations of each pier is provided with two courses of inclined footings, which have a total depth of just over {{Convert|1|m||order=flip}}.<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/>\n\nIn terms of its composition, the viaduct is largely composed of traditional red bricks and smooth [[limestone]].<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> The contrast between the two materials effectively highlights the deck and upper elements of the structure to the observer, although the limestone has been subjected to considerable weathering and staining since its original installation. Elements of both the brickwork and the limestone have been replaced over time in order to maintain the structure's integrity, extend its operational life, and to restore its appearance to better resemble its earlier state.<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> At its highest point, the Ouse Valley Viaduct is {{Convert|29.3|m||order=flip}} above the river crossing beneath it.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nIn the process of constructing the viaduct, it has been estimated that around 11 million bricks, many of which had been shipped across the [[English Channel]] from the [[Netherlands]] to [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] and [[Lewes]] in addition to some locally produced bricks, had been used for the structure.{{sfnp|Turner|1977|p=124}}<ref name = \"ice\" /> Furthermore, [[Caen stone]] was also brought from [[Normandy]] in France; this material was used for the classically balustraded parapets, string courses, pier caps and the four small rectangular Italianate pavilions.<ref name = \"eng time\"/><ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> Building materials were transported to the construction site on barges up the Ouse River Navigation. At each end of the [[abutment]] is an ornamental square open tower, the brickwork of which is faced with stone from Heddon Quarries near [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].{{sfnp|Turner|1977|p=124}}\n\n===Opening===\n[[File:Ouse Valley Viaduct top.jpg|thumb|Southbound view from on top of the Ouse Valley Viaduct, 2009]]\nThe [[Brighton main line]] was opened in two sections because completion was delayed by the need to construct some major earthworks.<ref name = \"eng time\" /> The viaduct was officially opened when the section between [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood Junction]] and [[Haywards Heath railway station|Haywards Heath]] was opened on 12 July 1841. Initially, there was only one track across the structure in operation; the second line, along with the viaduct's ornate stone parapets and pavilions, was not completed until the following year.<ref name = \"eng time\" /><ref name = \"lloyd bath\" />\n\nBy 1846, the viaduct had become part of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]].<ref name = \"eng time\" /> In 1923, as a result of the [[Railways Act 1921]], it became part of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] network. It remained under Southern's ownership until January 1948, when the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|Big Four railway companies]] formed the publicly owned railway operator [[British Rail|British Railways]].<ref name = \"eng time\" />\n\n===Maintenance activities===\nThe first major restoration work occurred during the 1890s. This had focused upon repairs to the brickwork because engineers of the late Victorian era were concerned that the original lime mortar used in the viaduct's construction was inadequate. It was decided that this should be replaced with cement mortar. However, replacement facing brickwork and substandard mortar eventually caused its own failures prompting more expensive repairs later on.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> This was likely due to the repair work having borne a greater share of the structure's load than intended, resulting in an accelerated failure rate; poorly bonded header bricks is another probable culprit for its ineffectiveness. Additionally, the parapets and pavilions, although made from [[Caen stone]] (a high-quality limestone), have been subjected to heavy [[weathering]].<ref name = \"eng time\" />\n\n[[File:Ouse Valley viaduct.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|The Ouse Valley Viaduct in 2007, with the four decorative pavilions visible at each end]]\nBy 1956, the damage to the viaduct was extensive but the cost of refurbishment work was deemed to be too high by British Rail.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The degradation was partially a consequence of the structure's long lifespan: when originally constructed, its designers had intended for the structure to have a design life of 120 years, which it had long since exceeded.<ref name = \"lloyd bath\" /> By May 1983, the viaduct had been officially recognised as a [[Grade II*]] [[listed building|listed structure]].<ref >{{NHLE\n  |num= 1366101\n  |desc=OUSE VALLEY RAILWAY VIADUCT THE OUSE VALLEY RAILWAY VIADUCT \n  |accessdate = 16 January 2016\n}}</ref><ref >[http://www.transporttrust.com/heritage-sites/heritage-detail/ouse-valley-viaduct \"Ouse Valley Viaduct.\"] ''transporttrust.com'', Retrieved: 4 June 2018.</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, the eight pavilions present on the viaduct were in such a poor condition that some of their roofs had fallen in and the installation of internal props was required to stop them collapsing further.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> As a consequence of its heritage status, all envisioned alterations to the viaduct need to be reviewed and agreed by [[English Heritage]].<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> When British Rail proposed to dismantle the original pavilions and rebuild them using reconstituted stonework, English Heritage refused permission to do so; accordingly, there were no substantial restoration performed to the viaduct during this period, a decision  which British Rail publicly attributed to the sizeable cost of undertaking such work. The fabric of the structure continued to deteriorate over the next decade; sections of the stonework began to fall away from the balustrades and parapets during this time.<ref name = \"eng time\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=93 \"Ouse Viaduct, Balcombe.\"] ''engineering-timelines.com'', Retrieved: 4 June 2018.</ref><ref name = \"ice\"/>\n\nStarting in March 1996, the viaduct underwent a \u00a36.5 million renovation overseen by national rail infrastructure company [[Railtrack]] and partially funded by grants from [[West Sussex County Council]], Railway Heritage Trust<ref>[http://railwayheritagetrust.co.uk/ Railway Heritage Trust]</ref> and [[English Heritage]].<ref name = \"ice\"/><ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> Harder-wearing limestone was imported from [[Bordeaux]] to ensure the closest match with the existing Caen stone in the balustrades and pavilions.<ref >{{cite web\n  |title=Trusting in Trusts: The Railway Heritage Trust: conservation and change\n  |url= http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/58/railway/br.html \n  |publisher=www.ihbc.org.uk\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903223327/http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/58/railway/br.html\n  |archive-date=2003-09-03\n  |accessdate=4 June 2018\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref >[https://www.bestofengland.com/ouse-valley-viaduct/ \"Ouse Valley Viaduct (aka Balcombe Viaduct).\"] ''bestofengland.com'', Retrieved: 4 June 2018.</ref> Some of the piers had to be reconstructed because of failures in the Victorian brickwork.

Each of these semi-circular arches had a span of {{Convert|9.1|m||order=flip}} and was supported upon [[tapering (mathematics)|tapered]] red brick piers.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> Each pier was almost divided into two separate halves by {{Convert|3|m||adj=on|order=flip}} vertical voids, capped by semi-circular rings at the top and base, as a weight-saving measure. This approach is credited with giving the structure a relatively slender appearance.<ref name = \"eng time\" /><ref name = \"lloyd bath\" /> The foundations of each pier is provided with two courses of inclined footings, which have a total depth of just over {{Convert|1|m||order=flip}}.<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/>\n\nIn terms of its composition, the viaduct is largely composed of traditional red bricks and smooth [[limestone]].<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> The contrast between the two materials effectively highlights the deck and upper elements of the structure to the observer, although the limestone has been subjected to considerable weathering and staining since its original installation. Elements of both the brickwork and the limestone have been replaced over time in order to maintain the structure's integrity, extend its operational life, and to restore its appearance to better resemble its earlier state.<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> At its highest point, the Ouse Valley Viaduct is {{Convert|29.3|m||order=flip}} above the river crossing beneath it.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nIn the process of constructing the viaduct, it has been estimated that around 11 million bricks, many of which had been shipped across the [[English Channel]] from the [[Netherlands]] to [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] and [[Lewes]] in addition to some locally produced bricks, had been used for the structure.{{sfnp|Turner|1977|p=124}}<ref name = \"ice\" /> Furthermore, [[Caen stone]] was also brought from [[Normandy]] in France; this material was used for the classically balustraded parapets, string courses, pier caps and the four small rectangular Italianate pavilions.<ref name = \"eng time\"/><ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> Building materials were transported to the construction site on barges up the Ouse River Navigation. At each end of the [[abutment]] is an ornamental square open tower, the brickwork of which is faced with stone from Heddon Quarries near [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].{{sfnp|Turner|1977|p=124}}\n\n===Opening===\n[[File:Ouse Valley Viaduct top.jpg|thumb|Southbound view from on top of the Ouse Valley Viaduct, 2009]]\nThe [[Brighton main line]] was opened in two sections because completion was delayed by the need to construct some major earthworks.<ref name = \"eng time\" /> The viaduct was officially opened when the section between [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood Junction]] and [[Haywards Heath railway station|Haywards Heath]] was opened on 12 July 1841. Initially, there was only one track across the structure in operation; the second line, along with the viaduct's ornate stone parapets and pavilions, was not completed until the following year.<ref name = \"eng time\" /><ref name = \"lloyd bath\" />\n\nBy 1846, the viaduct had become part of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]].<ref name = \"eng time\" /> In 1923, as a result of the [[Railways Act 1921]], it became part of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] network. It remained under Southern's ownership until January 1948, when the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|Big Four railway companies]] formed the publicly owned railway operator [[British Rail|British Railways]].<ref name = \"eng time\" />\n\n===Maintenance activities===\nThe first major restoration work occurred during the 1890s. This had focused upon repairs to the brickwork because engineers of the late Victorian era were concerned that the original lime mortar used in the viaduct's construction was inadequate. It was decided that this should be replaced with cement mortar. However, replacement facing brickwork and substandard mortar eventually caused its own failures prompting more expensive repairs later on.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> This was likely due to the repair work having borne a greater share of the structure's load than intended, resulting in an accelerated failure rate; poorly bonded header bricks is another probable culprit for its ineffectiveness. Additionally, the parapets and pavilions, although made from [[Caen stone]] (a high-quality limestone), have been subjected to heavy [[weathering]].<ref name = \"eng time\" />\n\n[[File:Ouse Valley viaduct.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|The Ouse Valley Viaduct in 2007, with the four decorative pavilions visible at each end]]\nBy 1956, the damage to the viaduct was extensive but the cost of refurbishment work was deemed to be too high by British Rail.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The degradation was partially a consequence of the structure's long lifespan: when originally constructed, its designers had intended for the structure to have a design life of 120 years, which it had long since exceeded.<ref name = \"lloyd bath\" /> By May 1983, the viaduct had been officially recognised as a [[Grade II*]] [[listed building|listed structure]].<ref >{{NHLE\n  |num= 1366101\n  |desc=OUSE VALLEY RAILWAY VIADUCT THE OUSE VALLEY RAILWAY VIADUCT \n  |accessdate = 16 January 2016\n}}</ref><ref >[http://www.transporttrust.com/heritage-sites/heritage-detail/ouse-valley-viaduct \"Ouse Valley Viaduct.\"] ''transporttrust.com'', Retrieved: 4 June 2018.</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, the eight pavilions present on the viaduct were in such a poor condition that some of their roofs had fallen in and the installation of internal props was required to stop them collapsing further.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> As a consequence of its heritage status, all envisioned alterations to the viaduct need to be reviewed and agreed by [[English Heritage]].<ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> When British Rail proposed to dismantle the original pavilions and rebuild them using reconstituted stonework, English Heritage refused permission to do so; accordingly, there were no substantial restoration performed to the viaduct during this period, a decision  which British Rail publicly attributed to the sizeable cost of undertaking such work. The fabric of the structure continued to deteriorate over the next decade; sections of the stonework began to fall away from the balustrades and parapets during this time.<ref name = \"eng time\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=93 \"Ouse Viaduct, Balcombe.\"] ''engineering-timelines.com'', Retrieved: 4 June 2018.</ref><ref name = \"ice\"/>\n\nStarting in March 1996, the viaduct underwent a \u00a36.5 million renovation overseen by national rail infrastructure company [[Railtrack]] and partially funded by grants from [[West Sussex County Council]], Railway Heritage Trust<ref>[http://railwayheritagetrust.co.uk/ Railway Heritage Trust]</ref> and [[English Heritage]].<ref name = \"ice\"/><ref name = \"lloyd bath\"/> Harder-wearing limestone was imported from [[Bordeaux]] to ensure the closest match with the existing Caen stone in the balustrades and pavilions.<ref >{{cite web\n  |title=Trusting in Trusts: The Railway Heritage Trust: conservation and change\n  |url= http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/58/railway/br.html \n  |publisher=www.ihbc.org.uk\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903223327/http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/58/railway/br.html\n  |archive-date=2003-09-03\n  |accessdate=4 June 2018\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref >[https://www.bestofengland.com/ouse-valley-viaduct/ \"Ouse Valley Viaduct (aka Balcombe Viaduct).\"] ''bestofengland.com'', Retrieved: 4 June 2018.</ref> Some of the piers had to be reconstructed because of failures in the Victorian brickwork.
