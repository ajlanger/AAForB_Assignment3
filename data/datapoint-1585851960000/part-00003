She was the first woman to host the Oscars ceremony.  Her transition to television won acclaim for drama and comedy. She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Moorehead|title=Agnes Moorehead {{!}} American actress|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], the daughter of former singer Mary (''n\u00e9e'' McCauley; 1883&ndash;1990), who was 17 when she was born, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman John Henderson Moorehead (1869&ndash;1938). She was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 in order to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and her ambition to become an actress grew \"very strong\". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, \"Who are you today, Agnes?\" while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann; 1906-1929) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father's parishioners. They were further encouraged by his amused reactions.<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\">Kear, Lynn.

In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in [[religion]]; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] recalled Moorehead's arriving on the set with \"the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other\".<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\"/>\n\nMoorehead always said that she graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1918. However, she appears in no Central High School yearbook while she does appear in the yearbook of Soldan High School. She lived near Soldan High School on Union Boulevard; she did not live near Central High School on Grand Avenue and Bell. Although her father did not discourage her acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. Moorehead earned a bachelor's degree in 1923, majoring in biology at [[Muskingum College]] in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays. She received an honorary doctorate in literature from Muskingum in 1947,<ref>{{cite news |editor-last=Rathbun |editor-first=Joe |title=Muskingum to Honor Actress |date=31 May 1947 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/293009118/ |newspaper=The Time Recorder |publisher=W.

She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].\n\n==Career==\nMoorehead's early career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her \"the value of a dollar\". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being \"the right type\", Moorehead returned to radio.\n\n===Mercury Theatre===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Moorehead in the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] (1940)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and Agnes Moorehead in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], Agnes Moorehead, and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942)\n}}\nBy 1937, Moorehead had joined [[Orson Welles]]' [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], as one of his principal performers along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. (In an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on 19 February 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (fifteen years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.)<ref>Moorehead, Agnes. ''The Dick Cavett Show'', youtube.com, ABC Television Network, 19 February 1973, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jobppR1MPs.</ref>  She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as [[Margo Lane]]. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered by most film critics as one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles' second film, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), and received the [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Award nomination]] for her performance. She also appeared in ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), a Mercury film production.\n\nMoorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'' as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nBy the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio as \"the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.\"<ref name=\"kear\"/> In 1943\u20131944, Moorehead portrayed \"matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet\", who was constantly offering her \"candied opinion\", in the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, {{ISBN|0-7864-1390-5}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries.She played Aggie McDonald in Johnny Belinda. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She also was in ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]''. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951\u20131952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962\u20131963.\n\n===Radio===\nIn her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir's role as Min Gump in ''[[The Gumps (radio)|The Gumps]]''. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the \"first lady of ''Suspense''\". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the  play ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number#Radio play|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].\n\nIn 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''[[Bringing Up Father (radio)|Bringing Up Father]]'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]] in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as \"the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.\"<ref name=\"dunningota\">Dunning, John.

Her roles included a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Man and Superman#Don Juan in Hell|Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]], and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical ''The Pink Jungle''. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].\n\n===Television===\nIn 1959, Moorehead guest starred on many series, including ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' and ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]''.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001547/ ''Agnes Moorehead - Acting Credits''] at IMDb</ref> Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J.

McFarland, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7864-2367-6}}</ref> In \"[[The Invaders (The Twilight Zone)|The Invaders]]\" (broadcast January 27, 1961) Moorehead played a woman whose isolated farm is plagued by mysterious intruders. In ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for \"The Invaders\", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.\n\nMoorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in \"Incident at Poco Tiempo\" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in \"The Night of the Vicious Valentine\" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\n===''Bewitched''===\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead with ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Dick York]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]]]\n\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Bewitched 1969.JPG|thumb|Moorehead as Endora in ''[[Bewitched]]'']]\nIn 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''[[Bewitched]]'' scripts as \"hack\" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>\"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon...\" ''TV Guide''. July 17\u201323, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''[[Bewitched]]'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it aired.\n\nMoorehead received six Emmy Award nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''[[Bewitched]]'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''New York Times'' in 1974, \"I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''[[Bewitched]]'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch.\" Later that year, she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but it was not challenging and the show itself was \"not breathtaking\", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as \"a tough old bird.\"<ref name=\"kear\">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\nIn fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a five-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''Bewitched'', announcing the new 1965 [[Chevrolet]] line.  Moorehead was featured with [[Dan Blocker]] extolling the virtues of the new '65 Chevy II.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode \"Certain Shadows on the Wall\". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].\n\nMoorehead supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of [[E. B. White]]'s children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.\n\nFor the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including \"The Contract\" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.\n\nIn January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean in 1952. Moorehead and Lee fostered a boy whose mother had 14 children and were giving six up for adoption. Moorehead felt pity and fostered her son Sean in 1949, but there was never an adoption. Sean had a twin sister but Moorehead did not adopt her. According to Debbie Reynolds that little girl was adopted by another actor or actress. Moorehead fostered Sean but did not raise him nor was she really involved in his life. The employees of Moorehead took care of Sean while she was away being an actress. Sean begged her many times to come home and be with him. She also was a strict disciplinarian and wanted Sean to behave a certain way. She married actor [[Robert Gist]] in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMoorehead's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and dispute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harbin|first1=Billy J., Kim Marra, and Robert A.

1974) was an American actress whose 41-year career included work in radio, stage, film, and television.<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', May 8, 1974, page 286.</ref> She is best known for her role as [[List of Bewitched characters#Endora|Endora]] on the television series ''[[Bewitched]]'', but she also had notable roles in films, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'', ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', and ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''.\n\nMoorehead rarely played lead roles, but her skill at character development and range earned her one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s in addition to nominations for four [[Academy Awards]] and six Emmy Awards. She was the first woman to host the Oscars ceremony.  Her transition to television won acclaim for drama and comedy. She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Moorehead|title=Agnes Moorehead {{!}} American actress|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], the daughter of former singer Mary (''n\u00e9e'' McCauley; 1883&ndash;1990), who was 17 when she was born, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman John Henderson Moorehead (1869&ndash;1938). She was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 in order to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and her ambition to become an actress grew \"very strong\". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, \"Who are you today, Agnes?\" while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann; 1906-1929) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father's parishioners. They were further encouraged by his amused reactions.<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\">Kear, Lynn. ''Agnes Moorehead: a Bio-Bibliography''. Greenwood Press, 1992. {{ISBN|9780313281556}}.</ref> Moorehead rarely spoke of her sister after her suicide at age 23.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8246713/margaret-ann-moorehead|title=Margaret Ann Moorehead Death Certificate|date=1929-07-16|website=Find a Grave|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>\n\nAs a young lady, Moorehead joined the chorus of the [[The Muny|St. Louis Municipal Opera Company]], known as \"The Muny\". In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in [[religion]]; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] recalled Moorehead's arriving on the set with \"the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other\".<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\"/>\n\nMoorehead always said that she graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1918. However, she appears in no Central High School yearbook while she does appear in the yearbook of Soldan High School. She lived near Soldan High School on Union Boulevard; she did not live near Central High School on Grand Avenue and Bell. Although her father did not discourage her acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. Moorehead earned a bachelor's degree in 1923, majoring in biology at [[Muskingum College]] in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays.

She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].\n\n==Career==\nMoorehead's early career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her \"the value of a dollar\". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being \"the right type\", Moorehead returned to radio.\n\n===Mercury Theatre===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Moorehead in the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] (1940)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and Agnes Moorehead in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], Agnes Moorehead, and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942)\n}}\nBy 1937, Moorehead had joined [[Orson Welles]]' [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], as one of his principal performers along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. (In an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on 19 February 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (fifteen years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.)<ref>Moorehead, Agnes. ''The Dick Cavett Show'', youtube.com, ABC Television Network, 19 February 1973, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jobppR1MPs.</ref>  She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as [[Margo Lane]]. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered by most film critics as one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles' second film, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), and received the [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Award nomination]] for her performance. She also appeared in ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), a Mercury film production.\n\nMoorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'' as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nBy the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio as \"the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.\"<ref name=\"kear\"/> In 1943\u20131944, Moorehead portrayed \"matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet\", who was constantly offering her \"candied opinion\", in the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, {{ISBN|0-7864-1390-5}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries.She played Aggie McDonald in Johnny Belinda. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She also was in ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]''. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951\u20131952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962\u20131963.\n\n===Radio===\nIn her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir's role as Min Gump in ''[[The Gumps (radio)|The Gumps]]''. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the \"first lady of ''Suspense''\". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the  play ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number#Radio play|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].\n\nIn 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''[[Bringing Up Father (radio)|Bringing Up Father]]'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]] in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as \"the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.\"<ref name=\"dunningota\">Dunning, John.

Her roles included a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Man and Superman#Don Juan in Hell|Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]], and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical ''The Pink Jungle''. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].\n\n===Television===\nIn 1959, Moorehead guest starred on many series, including ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' and ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]''.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001547/ ''Agnes Moorehead - Acting Credits''] at IMDb</ref> Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J.

In ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for \"The Invaders\", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.\n\nMoorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in \"Incident at Poco Tiempo\" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in \"The Night of the Vicious Valentine\" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\n===''Bewitched''===\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead with ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Dick York]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]]]\n\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Bewitched 1969.JPG|thumb|Moorehead as Endora in ''[[Bewitched]]'']]\nIn 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''[[Bewitched]]'' scripts as \"hack\" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>\"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon...\" ''TV Guide''. July 17\u201323, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''[[Bewitched]]'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it aired.\n\nMoorehead received six Emmy Award nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''[[Bewitched]]'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''New York Times'' in 1974, \"I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''[[Bewitched]]'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch.\" Later that year, she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but it was not challenging and the show itself was \"not breathtaking\", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as \"a tough old bird.\"<ref name=\"kear\">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\nIn fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a five-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''Bewitched'', announcing the new 1965 [[Chevrolet]] line.  Moorehead was featured with [[Dan Blocker]] extolling the virtues of the new '65 Chevy II.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode \"Certain Shadows on the Wall\". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].\n\nMoorehead supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of [[E. B. White]]'s children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.\n\nFor the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including \"The Contract\" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.\n\nIn January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean in 1952. Moorehead and Lee fostered a boy whose mother had 14 children and were giving six up for adoption. Moorehead felt pity and fostered her son Sean in 1949, but there was never an adoption. Sean had a twin sister but Moorehead did not adopt her. According to Debbie Reynolds that little girl was adopted by another actor or actress. Moorehead fostered Sean but did not raise him nor was she really involved in his life. The employees of Moorehead took care of Sean while she was away being an actress. Sean begged her many times to come home and be with him. She also was a strict disciplinarian and wanted Sean to behave a certain way. She married actor [[Robert Gist]] in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMoorehead's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and dispute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harbin|first1=Billy J., Kim Marra, and Robert A.
