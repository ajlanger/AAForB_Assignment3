It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast. We knew it was absolutely right within ten days. But the rest of the album took forever.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} Sources differ as to who the track was written for. According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition. Presley sent a note to Bowie saying, \"All the best, and have a great tour\"; Bowie kept the note for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Bowie's first wife [[Angie Bowie]] later claimed that the song was written for her,{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} saying that he sang the track over the telephone to her, \"just the way, all those years before, he'd sung me [the ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' track] \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\". It had a similar effect. I bought it.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}} According to Sandford, Ava Cherry also claimed to have been the inspiration for the song.{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}\n\nMusically, \"Golden Years\" is a [[funk]] and [[disco]] song.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}}<ref name=\"Mojica CoS\">{{cite web | url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | title=David Bowie \u2013 ''Station to Station'' [Special Edition] | website=[[Consequence of Sound]] | date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=1 June 2016 | last=Mojica |first= Frank | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709192925/http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | archive-date=9 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 August 2019|quote=...as well as the disco stylings of 'Golden Years.'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As the lead single of ''Station to Station'', the song is noted as musically different than the rest of its parent album.<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"Golden Years\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/golden-years-mt0054050615 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> While ''Station to Station'' is commonly regarded as the musical bridge between the funk and [[Soul music|soul]] of ''[[Young Americans]]'' to the experimental sound of his [[Berlin Trilogy]],{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} \"Golden Years\" is the only song on the album to showcase the similar funk sound of ''Young Americans'' compared to, in Pegg's words, \"the steelier musical landscape\" of ''Station to Station''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\" /> Pegg further comments that its American \"soul-pop\" roots are \"easily discernible\": he describes the main riff as \"owing a debt to\" the 1968 [[Cliff Nobles]] and Company song \"[[The Horse]]\" and the multi-tracked vocal refrain to 1958 single \"Happy Years\" by [[the Diamonds]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} The song is in the key of B major and begins with a \"simple two-chord\" riff (F{{music|sharp}}\u2013E),{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=288\u2013289}} which Buckley believes hooks the listener in instantly.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett calls the riff \"reminiscent\", albeit \"in very different circumstances\", to the [[Aladdin Sane (song)|title track]] of ''Aladdin Sane''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} According to Buckley, Bowie was looking to emulate something of the glitzy nostalgia of \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", which he was playing on piano in the studio when he came up with \"Golden Years\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett writes: \"The magical ingredients were percussive: the rattling of sticks against the hi-hat cymbal from the start, the startling clack of woodblocks, the sudden drum fills.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}} These elements combined \"channel\" the spirit of Elvis Presley in the verses, with a \"haughtier, more strident tone\" in the chorus.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}}\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Golden Years\" was released on 21 November 1975 as the lead single to Bowie's tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] (as RCA 2640/PB-10441) with the ''[[Young Americans]]'' track \"[[Can You Hear Me?

It is also included on ''Re:Call 2'', part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' compilation.\n* The song was included on the album ''[[Trainspotting (soundtrack)|Trainspotting #2: Music from the Motion Picture, Vol. #2]]'' (1997).\n* The song was included on the original soundtrack of ''[[A Knight's Tale (film)|A Knight's Tale]]'' (2001), starring [[Heath Ledger]]. The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.

According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition. Presley sent a note to Bowie saying, \"All the best, and have a great tour\"; Bowie kept the note for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Bowie's first wife [[Angie Bowie]] later claimed that the song was written for her,{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} saying that he sang the track over the telephone to her, \"just the way, all those years before, he'd sung me [the ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' track] \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\". It had a similar effect.

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.
