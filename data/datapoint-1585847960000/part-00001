It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395/The_Story_of_an_Hour|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s.

After being informed of her husband Brently's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief.

Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\".

Berkove notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L.

EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she is feeling). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\". This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and people) are moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.
