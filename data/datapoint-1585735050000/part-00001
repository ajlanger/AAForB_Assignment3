This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.\n\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.\nIn [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.\n\n===Symbolism and related customs===\nSome Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170383/When-is-Easter-2016-What-are-the-dates-for-Good-Friday-Easter-Sunday-and-Easter-Monday.html|title=When is Easter 2016?

The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.<ref name=Meaning/><ref name=\"Symbolism\"/>\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[\u015bwi\u0119conka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.\n\nDuring [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).\n\nIn [[Greece]], women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of [[Communion rite|Communion]]). These ceremonial eggs are known as kokkina avga.

In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English ''pasche''. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping ([[egg tapping]]) competition.\n\nIn the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the [[blood of Christ]], with further symbolism being found in the hard shell of the egg symbolizing the sealed [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]] \u2014 the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead.

This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.\n\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.\nIn [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.\n\n===Symbolism and related customs===\nSome Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170383/When-is-Easter-2016-What-are-the-dates-for-Good-Friday-Easter-Sunday-and-Easter-Monday.html|title=When is Easter 2016?

The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.<ref name=Meaning/><ref name=\"Symbolism\"/>\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[\u015bwi\u0119conka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.\n\nDuring [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).\n\nIn [[Greece]], women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of [[Communion rite|Communion]]).

It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical [[Northward equinox]], which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. The painted eggs symbolize fertility and are displayed on the Nowruz table, called [[Haft-Seen]] together with various other symbolic objects. There are sometimes one egg for each member of the family.

While it is often claimed that the use of painted eggs is an ancient, pre-Christian component of the celebration of Ostara, there are no historical accounts that ancient celebrations included this practice, apart from the [[Old High German lullaby]] which is believed by most to be a modern fabrication. Rather, the use of painted eggs has been adopted under the assumption that it might be a pre-Christian survival. In fact, modern scholarship has been unable to trace any association between eggs and a supposed goddess named Ostara before the 19th century, when early folklorists began to speculate about the possibility.<ref name=Winick2016>Winick, Stephen.

The children's game of hunting for the [[afikomen]] (a half-piece of matzo) has similarities to the Easter egg hunt tradition, by which the child who finds the hidden bread will be awarded a prize. In other homes, the children hide the afikoman and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize for revealing its location.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Washi Egg Japan US 2.png|thumb|[[Washi eggs|Washi Egg]] ]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Balut (egg)|Balut]]\n*[[Century egg]]\n*[[Chinese red eggs]]\n*[[Cascar\u00f3n]]\n*[[Easter Bilby]]\n*[[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n*[[Festum Ovorum]]\n*[[Kinder Surprise]]\n*[[List of egg dishes]]\n*[[List of foods with religious symbolism]]\n*[[Resurrection of Jesus]]\n*[[Salted duck egg]]\n*[[Sham El Nessim]]\n*[[Smoked egg]]\n*[[Tea egg]]\n*[[Vegreville egg]]\n*[[Washi eggs]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Easter eggs}}\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Eggs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Easter Egg}}\n[[Category:Easter food|Egg]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions|Egg]]\n[[Category:Eggs (food)]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Christianity and religious syncretism]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:a2f:f600:3d28:b6f4:25bf:10b8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg"}
