At the time, most technical institutes in the United States were in the northeastern states; thus the need for a technical institute in the south was great.<ref>W. L. Hughes, \"A Brief Chronology of the Technical Institute Movement in America.\" The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), 1947.</ref>\n\nIn response to the growing demand, the president of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], Colonel [[Blake R. Van Leer]], sought to establish a technical institute program in Georgia. In 1945 he was approached by the [[Associated Industries of Georgia]] (AIG) who shared their common desire to have such a program and offered Van Leer their support. It took years for Van Leer to convince the Board of Regents to give Georgia Tech authorization to establish a technical institute. On October 8, 1947 the authorization was granted. The location chosen for the fledgling institute was a Naval Air Station in Chamblee, GA, which eventually became the site of [[DeKalb\u2013Peachtree Airport]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://soar.kennesaw.edu/bitstream/handle/11360/1974/sp-51-03-spsuhist-20161026.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Southern Polytechnic State University: The History|last=Bennett|first=Richard A.|publisher=Southern Polytechnic State University Foundation|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{Rp|1}} The first director was to be Professor Lawrence V.
