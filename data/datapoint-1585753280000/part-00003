A development of the previous year's [[Lotus 97T|97T]], the car was raced by Brazilian [[Ayrton Senna]], in his second year with the team, and Scottish newcomer [[Johnny Dumfries]].\n\nThe chassis featured a lower monocoque than the 97T as a result of a regulation change stipulating a reduction in fuel capacity to 195 litres. The powertrain consisted of the new [[Renault F1|Renault]] [[Renault EF-Type engine|EF15B]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] V6 engine, driving through a six-speed, [[sequential manual transmission|manual sequential]] Hewland gearbox.<ref name=\"power\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelotusforums.com/latest-news/our-news/the-power-and-the-glory-lotus-98t/|title=The power and the glory. Lotus 98T.|date=3 December 2015|website=The Lotus Forums|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe EF15B was to appear in two forms, the standard engine and the \"D.P.\" engine which featured pneumatic valve springs for the first time. At the end of the season [[Renault F1|Renault]] introduced the revised EF15C which in addition to the D.P. valve gear also boasted common rail fuel injection and much revised water cooling through the cylinder head reducing the likelihood of pre-ignition (detonation). Power figures for this period of F1 history are largely speculative as most engine manufactures freely admitted that their test beds would not have a sufficient power rating to measure the 1.5 litre turbos output at above 4 bar boost. It is claimed that the Renault EF15B in its pinnacle increment was claimed to produce in excess of 1000 HP at unrestricted boost pressure, thus making it one of the most powerful engines ever used in Formula 1 history. <ref name=\"power\"/> \n\nThis was, however, during qualifying, where teams used unrestricted boost pressures for maximum power output, and for very quick lap times. These unrestricted engines were very unreliable, and would only last about a couple clean laps. Therefore, the 98T produced around 900 HP in race trim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turnology.com/news/video-onboard-the-terrifying-lotus-98t-turbo-f1/|title=Video: Onboard the Terrifying Lotus 98T Turbo F1!|date=25 March 2016|website=turnology.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref> The 98T was also the final Lotus powered by a Renault engine, as Lotus switched to Honda for the following year/season.\n\nThe gearbox came in two variants, a conventional five speed and a new six speed. The six speed was very much a development gearbox and was largely unreliable. While Senna opted to run only with the five speed, Dumfries was tasked with testing the six speed. Both gearboxes featured Hewland internals within a Lotus designed casing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/684/Lotus-98T-Renault.html|title=1986 Lotus 98T Renault - Images, Specifications and Information|website=Ultimatecarpage.com|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther notable innovations of the 98T included a two-stage ride height adjustment, water injection through the intercoolers, an early form of barge board (also present on the 97T) and an advanced (for the time) fuel consumption micro computer.\n\n==Driver controversy==\nAt the end of 1985 [[Elio de Angelis]], who had driven for Lotus since 1980, left the team to join [[Brabham]]. Lotus intended to replace the Italian with [[Derek Warwick]], out of a drive as a result of Renault closing their factory team. However, Ayrton Senna did not believe that the team could sustain two number 1 drivers, and did not want the focus of the team to be on anything but himself. He thus put pressure on Lotus not to sign Warwick, and to instead sign his fellow countryman, [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]], as a number 2 driver. The team bowed to Senna's first demand, but signed Johnny Dumfries rather than Gugelmin, as long-time sponsor [[John Player & Sons|John Player]] reportedly wanted a British driver. Subsequently, Warwick replaced de Angelis at Brabham after the Italian's fatal testing accident at [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] (and eventually joined Lotus in {{F1|1990}}), while Gugelmin would not appear in F1 until he joined the [[March Engineering|March]] team in {{F1|1988}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2010/76/lunch-derek-warwick|title=Lunch With...

With Renault withdrawing from F1 at the end of 1986, Lotus did a deal with [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] to use the Japanese company's engines in {{F1|1987}} and 1988. As part of the deal, the team signed Honda's official test driver, [[Satoru Nakajima]], as Senna's teammate for 1987. John Player, still wanting a British driver in the team, subsequently pulled its sponsorship, to be replaced by another cigarette brand, [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-2008/90/lunch-peter-warr|title=Lunch with...
