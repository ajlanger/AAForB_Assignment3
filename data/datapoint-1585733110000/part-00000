Occupiers cleared the tall grass, tilled the land, and planted multiple vegetable gardens with support of more than 100 members of the community over that weekend. This second occupation was raided by UCPD on May 14, but members of the movement and supporters returned to reoccupy and plant again on the following weeks. After a second police raid on the occupation encampment, the movement switched focus from land occupations to the establishment of a community partnership with agroecology researchers at the College of Natural Resources for access to a portion of the Gill Tract.<ref name=\"grist.org\">John Upton [http://grist.org/news/occupy-the-farm-movement-rises-again-hours-after-being-raided/Occupy the Farm movement rises again, hours after being raided.] Grist News, May 14, 2013</ref> \n\nAs UC continued to propose a development project with \"Sprouts Farmer's Market\", the movement organized a Boycott Sprouts campaign.<ref name=\"indybay.org\">East Bay [http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2013/09/27/18743917.php Vegetables Bulldozed inside Sprouts Farmers Market grocery store], 27 September, 2013 </ref><ref name=\"boycottsprouts.com\">http://boycottsprouts.com/</ref>\n{{as of |December 2014}} a 1.3-acre experimental urban farm  on the north side, shared ground with a quarter-acre urban gardening project and a 2.5-acre plot devoted to corn genetics research.<ref>Glen Martin [https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2015-03-26/getting-front-row-seat-occupy-farm-movie Getting a Front Row Seat at Occupy the Farm: The Movie] California Magazine / Just In, December 17, 2014</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.takebackthetract.com/ Occupy the Farm{{spaced ndash}} Take back the Gill Tract] (Official website)\n* [http://www.boycottsprouts.com/ Campaign to Boycott Sprouts Market]\n\n{{Occupy movement}}\n{{University of California, Berkeley}}\n\n[[Category:2012 in California]]\n[[Category:2012 protests]]\n[[Category:2013 in California]]\n[[Category:2013 protests]]\n[[Category:Albany, California]]\n[[Category:Community gardening in California]]\n[[Category:Food sovereignty]]\n[[Category:Occupy movement in the United States]]\n[[Category:Politics of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Student protests in California]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley]]\n[[Category:Urban agriculture]]\n[[Category:Squats in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFirst occupation, 2012:Journal cites:, added 1 DOI", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_the_Farm"}
