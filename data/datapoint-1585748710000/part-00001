His father, Robert Baldwin, Sr., (1926-2008) was a full-time Engineer, and a part-time pianist who worked local clubs throughout [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County, NY]], just north of New York City. While his father was a fan of such jazz icons like Mikes Davis, Bud Powell and Oscar Peterson, his older sister, Deborah, was a fan of soul music of the 1960s, including music by Motown, Stax record labels. These early musical experiences profoundly impacted Baldwin's musical path. He's also a fan of his elder cousin, jazz pianist [[Larry Willis]], who played with Blood, Sweat and Tears, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band.\n\nIn 1987, Sony founded the Sony Innovator's Awards, an annual ceremony to award aspiring Afro-American artists who have shown outstanding talent in music and the visual arts. In his opening speech at the first ceremony held in 1988, music producer [[Quincy Jones]] stated that it was encouraging that a large firm like Sony was providing Afro-American artists a chance to be introduced to the entire nation. Baldwin was awarded the Sony Innovators Award in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&source=bl&ots=Eaq4JB388j&sig=vOLsrBhXJO-hQjDvJz0o6KNttVU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5_P7S_uLaAhXCm-AKHexbC_MQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&q=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&f=false|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 November 1989|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=19 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> selected by [[Roberta Flack]].<ref name=\"Sony\">{{cite news|title=Sony Innovators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA29&ots=E7v8ME665i&dq=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&f=false|page=29|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=Ebony|date=November 1989}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he met his cousin, Pianist [[Larry Willis]], who's claim to fame began with the pop group Blood, Sweat and Tears. They met later at the funeral of Bob's grandfather, Percy Willis in Norfolk, Va. They played at the elder Willis funeral, and a musical bond was created. Bob and Larry later played at the Savannah Jazz Festival in 2008, both opening for pianist Bob James. They maintained a musical and family bond since 1990.\n\nOut of necessity to maintain creative control, he independently learned how to record music from engineers Wayne Warnecke, Dennis. In 1990, Baldwin worked briefly with producer/arranger/keyboardist [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], where he learned about the \u2018wall of sound\u2019 panning technique. In 1989 -1990, he was hired by Kashif to play keyboards and piano on a recording project by a group called The Promise (Arista Records) featuring vocalist [[Joi Cardwell]], but the project was never released.\n\n==Education==\nHe attended [[Geneva College]] in 1978, and graduated in 1986, but to complete his degree, he would have to attend several New York-based Colleges, including [[Hunter College|Hunter]], [[Concordia College (New York)|Concordia]] and [[Iona College (New York)|Iona]], transferring credits back to Geneva between 1980-1986. He majored in Business Administration and minored in Broadcast Communication.\n\nIt was at Geneva College where he discovered Broadcasting radio and hosted his first radio program at college radio station [[WGEV]] from 1979-1980, and after falling short on college funding at Geneva, he returned to New York in 1981, where he completed his college degree, and while in New York, he further developed his broadcasting skills. He later founded the NewUrbanJazz radio program in 2008, which originally aired on WFSK, WNAA, WJAB, WVAS, and WVSU.\n\nBaldwin is listed as a famous Geneva College Alumni, according to Ranker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-geneva-college-alumni-and-students/reference|title=Famous Geneva College Alumni|website=Ranker|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Radio career==\nBetween 1978-1980, Baldwin discovered his love of radio at Geneva College at [[WGEV]], where he minored in Broadcast Communications. It was there he learned radio production, and was a jazz jock on Sunday nights. At Geneva College, he also re-ignited his love for the piano.\n\nBaldwin returned to New York in January, 1981 to utilize and further hone both his music and radio skills. He finished his college career at Concordia, Hunter and Iona Colleges while doing local gigs in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester County.\n\nIn September 1981, Baldwin secured a radio internship at [[Inner City Broadcasting Corporation|Inner City Broadcasting]] ([[WLIB]]/[[WBLS|WBLS) in New York, NY]], then owned by Tuskegee Airman [[Percy Sutton]], where he studied news reporting, and honed other broadcasting skills under the tutelage of then News Director [[KTWV|Pat Prescott]], the late Carl Ferguson<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofaltonmaddox.com/site/the-making-of-a-media-monster/|title=The Making of a Media Monster \u00a9 \u2013 University Of Alton Maddox|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> News Director David Lampel, Larry Hardesty, and Mark Reilly.\n\nIn 1981-1983, he worked briefly at [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], then-owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, where he pulled news wire for the staff writers.\n\nIn 1984, he was a field news reporter in Westchester County for [[WVIP]] Radio, then located in Mt. Kisco, NY (now located in New Rochelle, NY). He covered the Jesse Jackson Presidential campaign that same year when Jackson came to Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle.\n\nBaldwin reunited with the aforementioned Prescott when she worked for CD101.9 in New York. Prescott introduced Baldwin's music there in the late 1980s. Between 1998 and 2004, he wrote, sang and produced the [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]] jingle, up to when they changed their smooth jazz format to \"New York Chill\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, he was hired by Tame Broadcasting<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/former-tama-wjsj-to-be-sold/|title=Former Tama WJSJ to be Sold|first=|last=RBR.com|date=20 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> as the Music Director at [[WJSJ]] (Jacksonville, Fl.), and after that tenure, he helped to launch the first ever smooth jazz station in Bermuda (KJAZ - Trott Communications) from 2005 to 2006.\n\nBaldwin then worked as the Music Director in 2007 at [[WCLK]] (Clark University), then later that fall at [[WJZZ (FM)|WJZZ]], a Radio-One company. Radio-One's WJZZ became Urban AC \u201cMagic 107.5\u201d at 12:00am.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/netgnomes/612/107-5-wjzz-atlanta-to-change-formats/|title=107.5 WJZZ Atlanta To Change Formats|date=28 January 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Baldwin started programming music at both WCLK and WJZZ, which he would later coin the programming sound as \"NewUrbanJazz\". He later founded the NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a weekly syndicated program.\n\n==The NewUrbanJazz radio program==\nIn October 2008, Baldwin fused his musician and radio skills and launched NewUrbanJazz Radio, which programs The NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a 2-hour program that is affiliated on over 40 stations in the U.S. WJAB (Huntsville, Al), WFSK (Nashville, Tn), WNAA (Greensboro, NC), WVAS (Montgomery, Al) and WVSU (Birmingham) were their initial affiliate base. NewUrbanJazz is a fusion of contemporary Jazz, fused with Urban and Brazilian flavors, but also spins music from independent artists. Baldwin's decision to launch NewUrbanJazz Radio Format was based on the sudden closure of [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newurbanjazz.com/|title=NewUrbanJazz Lounge - Jazz Music, Radio, Events, Artists, & Musician Page|website=Newurbanjazz.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> and his show has expanded to stations in Springfield (WEIB), Atlanta (WCLK), and the U.S. Virgin Islands [https://stjohnsource.com/2019/08/12/wtjx-93-1adds-10-new-shows-to-roster/ (WTJX)], as well as some stations under the [http://www.aaprc.org/ African-American Public Radio Consortium.]\n\n==Early career==\nBetween March and September 1986, Baldwin, along with New York-based guitarist Al Orlo, created the Bob Baldwin/Al Orlo Project, and they performed on Sundays at the Vinnie Pastore-owned Crazy Horse,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-spotlight-vincent-pastore-article-1.342233|title=Bronx spotlight on Vincent Pastore|author=Bob Kappstater|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> a now-defunct small rock and roll club (with a capacity of 50 people) in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. It was a workshop-based project to practice and perform live original material written by Orlo and Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin opened up for the aforementioned trumpeter Browne at The Bottom Line, based in New York City, NY. From that performance, he played alongside Browne in his band, and later collaborated with him on his disc ''No Longer I'', a Gospel-Jazz recording in 1987. Through that production, he met Danny Weiss, the then President for Malaco Jazz. They later co-produced Baldwin's first disc, ''I've Got a Long Way to Go'' together on [[Malaco Records]] in 1988 along with David Wilkes. He began his Contemporary Jazz music career with his first solo album release in 1988 (\"I've Got a Long Way To Go\") on [[Malaco Jazz Records]]. The project was submitted to the Sony Innovators Award<ref name=\"Sony\" /> in 1989 and won first place. One of the top three finalists included the Detroit music group Straight Ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicwikidetroit.org/index.php/Straight_Ahead|title=Straight Ahead|website=Musicwikidetroit.org|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> [[Roberta Flack]] was the finalist judge.\n\nThat award led to his artist signing to [[Atlantic Jazz]], then presided by [[Sylvia Rhone]].

''Reflections'' charted top-20 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=%22reflections+of+love%22+billboard+bob+baldwin&source=bl&ots=rkl8N5lxFR&sig=qCy03CytAZuImNy-IA8pEQHJSC4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5OF1UbjrB9LH4AOTioCoBg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22reflections+of+love%22+billboard+bob+baldwin&f=true|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=20 June 1992|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=35|accessdate=19 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Baldwin found the company, City Sketches, Inc., a production music house.

His father, Robert Baldwin, Sr., (1926-2008) was a full-time Engineer, and a part-time pianist who worked local clubs throughout [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County, NY]], just north of New York City. While his father was a fan of such jazz icons like Mikes Davis, Bud Powell and Oscar Peterson, his older sister, Deborah, was a fan of soul music of the 1960s, including music by Motown, Stax record labels. These early musical experiences profoundly impacted Baldwin's musical path. He's also a fan of his elder cousin, jazz pianist [[Larry Willis]], who played with Blood, Sweat and Tears, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band.\n\nIn 1987, Sony founded the Sony Innovator's Awards, an annual ceremony to award aspiring Afro-American artists who have shown outstanding talent in music and the visual arts. In his opening speech at the first ceremony held in 1988, music producer [[Quincy Jones]] stated that it was encouraging that a large firm like Sony was providing Afro-American artists a chance to be introduced to the entire nation. Baldwin was awarded the Sony Innovators Award in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&source=bl&ots=Eaq4JB388j&sig=vOLsrBhXJO-hQjDvJz0o6KNttVU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5_P7S_uLaAhXCm-AKHexbC_MQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&q=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&f=false|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 November 1989|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=19 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> selected by [[Roberta Flack]].<ref name=\"Sony\">{{cite news|title=Sony Innovators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA29&ots=E7v8ME665i&dq=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&f=false|page=29|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=Ebony|date=November 1989}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he met his cousin, Pianist [[Larry Willis]], who's claim to fame began with the pop group Blood, Sweat and Tears. They met later at the funeral of Bob's grandfather, Percy Willis in Norfolk, Va. They played at the elder Willis funeral, and a musical bond was created. Bob and Larry later played at the Savannah Jazz Festival in 2008, both opening for pianist Bob James. They maintained a musical and family bond since 1990.\n\nOut of necessity to maintain creative control, he independently learned how to record music from engineers Wayne Warnecke, Dennis. In 1990, Baldwin worked briefly with producer/arranger/keyboardist [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], where he learned about the \u2018wall of sound\u2019 panning technique. In 1989 -1990, he was hired by Kashif to play keyboards and piano on a recording project by a group called The Promise (Arista Records) featuring vocalist [[Joi Cardwell]], but the project was never released.\n\n==Education==\nHe attended [[Geneva College]] in 1978, and graduated in 1986, but to complete his degree, he would have to attend several New York-based Colleges, including [[Hunter College|Hunter]], [[Concordia College (New York)|Concordia]] and [[Iona College (New York)|Iona]], transferring credits back to Geneva between 1980-1986. He majored in Business Administration and minored in Broadcast Communication.\n\nIt was at Geneva College where he discovered Broadcasting radio and hosted his first radio program at college radio station [[WGEV]] from 1979-1980, and after falling short on college funding at Geneva, he returned to New York in 1981, where he completed his college degree, and while in New York, he further developed his broadcasting skills. He later founded the NewUrbanJazz radio program in 2008, which originally aired on WFSK, WNAA, WJAB, WVAS, and WVSU.\n\nBaldwin is listed as a famous Geneva College Alumni, according to Ranker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-geneva-college-alumni-and-students/reference|title=Famous Geneva College Alumni|website=Ranker|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Radio career==\nBetween 1978-1980, Baldwin discovered his love of radio at Geneva College at [[WGEV]], where he minored in Broadcast Communications. It was there he learned radio production, and was a jazz jock on Sunday nights. At Geneva College, he also re-ignited his love for the piano.\n\nBaldwin returned to New York in January, 1981 to utilize and further hone both his music and radio skills. He finished his college career at Concordia, Hunter and Iona Colleges while doing local gigs in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester County.\n\nIn September 1981, Baldwin secured a radio internship at [[Inner City Broadcasting Corporation|Inner City Broadcasting]] ([[WLIB]]/[[WBLS|WBLS) in New York, NY]], then owned by Tuskegee Airman [[Percy Sutton]], where he studied news reporting, and honed other broadcasting skills under the tutelage of then News Director [[KTWV|Pat Prescott]], the late Carl Ferguson<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofaltonmaddox.com/site/the-making-of-a-media-monster/|title=The Making of a Media Monster \u00a9 \u2013 University Of Alton Maddox|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> News Director David Lampel, Larry Hardesty, and Mark Reilly.\n\nIn 1981-1983, he worked briefly at [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], then-owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, where he pulled news wire for the staff writers.\n\nIn 1984, he was a field news reporter in Westchester County for [[WVIP]] Radio, then located in Mt. Kisco, NY (now located in New Rochelle, NY). He covered the Jesse Jackson Presidential campaign that same year when Jackson came to Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle.\n\nBaldwin reunited with the aforementioned Prescott when she worked for CD101.9 in New York. Prescott introduced Baldwin's music there in the late 1980s. Between 1998 and 2004, he wrote, sang and produced the [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]] jingle, up to when they changed their smooth jazz format to \"New York Chill\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, he was hired by Tame Broadcasting<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/former-tama-wjsj-to-be-sold/|title=Former Tama WJSJ to be Sold|first=|last=RBR.com|date=20 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> as the Music Director at [[WJSJ]] (Jacksonville, Fl.), and after that tenure, he helped to launch the first ever smooth jazz station in Bermuda (KJAZ - Trott Communications) from 2005 to 2006.\n\nBaldwin then worked as the Music Director in 2007 at [[WCLK]] (Clark University), then later that fall at [[WJZZ (FM)|WJZZ]], a Radio-One company.

He later founded the NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a weekly syndicated program.\n\n==The NewUrbanJazz radio program==\nIn October, 2008, Baldwin fused his musician and radio skills and launched NewUrbanJazz Radio, which programs The NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a 2-hour program that is affiliated on over 40 stations in the U.S. WJAB (Huntsville, Al), WFSK (Nashville, Tn), WNAA (Greensboro, NC), WVAS (Montgomery, Al) and WVSU (Birmingham) were their initial affiliate base. NewUrbanJazz is a fusion of contemporary Jazz, fused with Urban and Brazilian flavors, but also spins music from independent artists. Baldwin's decision to launch NewUrbanJazz Radio Format was based on the sudden closure of [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newurbanjazz.com/|title=NewUrbanJazz Lounge - Jazz Music, Radio, Events, Artists, & Musician Page|website=Newurbanjazz.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> and his show has expanded to stations in Springfield (WEIB), Atlanta (WCLK), and the U.S. Virgin Islands [https://stjohnsource.com/2019/08/12/wtjx-93-1adds-10-new-shows-to-roster/ (WTJX)], as well as some stations under the [http://www.aaprc.org/ African-American Publc Radio Consortium.]\n\n==Early career==\nBetween March and September 1986, Baldwin, along with New York-based guitarist Al Orlo, created the Bob Baldwin/Al Orlo Project, and they performed on Sundays at the Vinnie Pastore-owned Crazy Horse,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-spotlight-vincent-pastore-article-1.342233|title=Bronx spotlight on Vincent Pastore|author=Bob Kappstater|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> a now-defunct small rock and roll club (with a capacity of 50 people) in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. It was a workshop-based project to practice and perform live original material written by Orlo and Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin opened up for the aforementioned trumpeter Browne at The Bottom Line, based in New York City, NY. From that performance, he played alongside Browne in his band, and later collaborated with him on his disc ''No Longer I'', a Gospel-Jazz recording in 1987. Through that production, he met Danny Weiss, the then President for Malaco Jazz. They later co-produced Baldwin's first disc, ''I've Got a Long Way to Go'' together on [[Malaco Records]] in 1988 along with David Wilkes. He began his Contemporary Jazz music career with his first solo album release in 1988 (\"I've Got a Long Way To Go\") on [[Malaco Jazz Records]].The project was submitted to the Sony Innovators Award<ref name=\"Sony\" /> in 1989 and won first place.
