It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories.\n\n==Construction==\n3801 was built in 1943 by [[Clyde Engineering]] as the first of 30 [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a [[Streamliner|streamlined]] design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at [[Eveleigh Railway Workshops|Eveleigh]] and [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] and were unstreamlined.\n\nThe 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by [[World War II]]. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare. It became known at the time as the ''Grey Nurse'' due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme. \n\n==In service==\n[[File:Railway Station - Stanmore (2715093301).jpg|thumb|left|3801 passes through [[Stanmore railway station, Sydney|Stanmore]] in 1945]]\nOn 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' for the first time.<ref name=Roundhouse>\"The 38 Class\" ''[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]]\" July 1981 pages 22\u201329</ref> When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the ''Melbourne Limited'' expresses between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]]. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A [[Waratah]] emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \"glamour workings\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38's. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).\n\nIn early 1963 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 28 June 1964. Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] in 1988.<ref>\"New Newcastle Speed Record\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' December 1988 page 437</ref> On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965 the locomotive was found to have serious [[boiler]] problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966 3801 returned to service, however the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the loco was withdrawn. Another boiler exam gave the loco a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' on 31 May 1969, as well as the ''[[Western Endeavour]]'' special across the continent to [[Perth]] between 22 August and 12 September 1970.<ref name=Roundhouse/> In October 1972, 3801 worked to [[South Australia]] with [[3642]] as part of celebrations to open the [[Whyalla railway line|Whyalla line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=William|title=Steel Wheels on Railway to Whyalla|date=1973|publisher=Austrail Publications|location=Bulli|isbn=0 909597 12 X}}</ref><ref name=Enviro>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807230 Locomotive, Steam 3801] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref>\n\nFrom April 1974 under the [[Public Transport Commission]] all steam trains were barred from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film ''[[A Steam Train Passes]]''.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:3801 walsh island.jpg|thumb|3801 under restoration at the [[State Dockyard]]]]\n[[File:3801 (NSW steam locomotive) 2.JPG|thumb|3801 at [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow station]] in January 2006]]\n[[File:3801 Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|3801 at [[Wagga Wagga railway station|Wagga Wagga station]] in June 2006 with a recreation of its original ''Grey Nurse'' colour scheme]]\n3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] to help raise money for survivors of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. After this 3801 was deeded to the Rail Transport Museum.  In June 1975, it hauled [[New South Wales D57 class locomotive|5711]] and [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|1905]] to [[Thirlmere railway station|Thirlmere]] when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.<ref>\"Museum on the Move\" ''Roundhouse'' June 1976 page 16</ref> The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal.\n\nIn November 1982 [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] [[Chief Executive]] of the [[State Rail Authority]] enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the [[South Maitland Railway]]s (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members \u2013 [[3820]] and [[3830]] (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) \u2013 and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.\n\nWith some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the [[State Dockyard]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company \u2013 an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|8111]] on an excursion train from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]].<ref>\"3801 Welcome back\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1986 pages 363\u2013366</ref>\n\nThe firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The [[Tender locomotive|tender]] tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]]. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].<ref>\"Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986\" ''Railway Digest'' January 1987 page 30</ref>\n\nAfter restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by [[3801 Limited]] under a 20-year lease. During the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.<ref>\"3801 West\" ''Railway Digest'' July 1988 page 250</ref> In October 1988, [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']] arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.<ref name=Enviro/>\n\nOn 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the [[Cowan rail disaster]]. 3801 was struggling to climb the [[Cowan Bank]] (on the Sydney side of the [[Hawkesbury River]]) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a [[CityRail]] [[NSW TrainLink V set|Interurban]] passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.<ref>{{cite web|work=Emergency NSW | title=Cowan 1990| url=http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html|accessdate=8 December 2007\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120830/http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html\n|archivedate=2 October 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Emergency Management|title=Transport \u2013 Brooklyn Train Collision|url=http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180333/http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 3801 visited [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at [[Robertson railway station|Robertson]]. 3801 was a regular at the [[Hunter Valley Steamfest]].\n\nDespite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007.\n\n==2008\u20132020 overhaul==\nWhen 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs.<ref>{{cite web| work=Office of Rail Heritage | title=Office of Rail Heritage \u2013 Projects| url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects.htm| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Dampflokwerk Meiningen]] in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair.\n\nIn 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia.  Trial fitting of the boiler revealed a number of dimensional and technical issues which made it unsuitable for use.  The boiler was subsequently returned to Germany in 2011. <ref>[https://www.thnsw.com.au/3801-project Locomotive 3801 Project]</ref>\n\nThe 3801 website features updates on the locomotives progress issued by the NSW Office of Rail Heritage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhconservation3801.htm |title=3801 locomotive overhaul|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302145659/http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhconservation3801.htm|archivedate=2 March 2014}}</ref> with archived updates available separately.<ref>[http://www.3801.com.au/ Overhaul and New Boiler, 3801]</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, [[Minister for Transport (New South Wales)|Transport Minister]] [[Gladys Berejiklian]] acknowledged the importance of 3801 saying it would be a priority of the new not-for-profit company [[Transport Heritage NSW]] to return 3801 to service.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/fixing-trains-fresh-start-rail-heritage Fixing the trains: A fresh start for Rail Heritage]</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 a spokesman for [[Transport for NSW]] announced that the German built boiler for the 3801 steam locomotive would be brought back to Australia so that local experts can get the locomotive back on the tracks.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-update-steam-train-locomotive-3801 Transport for NSW update on steam train locomotive 3801] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126042539/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-update-steam-train-locomotive-3801 |date=26 November 2014 }} Transport for NSW 21 November 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.transportheritagensw.com.au/#!update-on-3801-nov14/c160w Update on Locomotive 3801] Transport Heritage NSW 21 November 2014</ref> In September 2015, Transport Heritage NSW announced that 3801 would return to service in 2017 with the original boiler to be recondtioned.<ref>[http://www.transportheritagensw.com.au/#!The-way-forward-for-two-much-loved-steam-locomotives/c1ofn/55f2773b0cf23d0ff000ffa7 The way forward for two much-loved steam locomotives] Transport Heritage NSW 11 September 2015</ref>\nIn July 2019 the boiler upgrades were completed and the boiler was mounted to the frame<ref>https://www.thnsw.com.au/post/3801-update-july-2019</ref>\nIn early September 2019 the locomotive passed its first steam test.<ref>https://www.thnsw.com.au/post/locomotive-3801-steam-test</ref>\nAs a result of the firebox upgrades the boiler pressure was increased to the original 245 psi.\n\nThe locomotive was scheduled to have its first mainline test on 9 December 2019 but due to fire bans and work not being finished in time the trial was postponed to January 2020.

It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories.\n\n==Construction==\n3801 was built in 1943 by [[Clyde Engineering]] as the first of 30 [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a [[Streamliner|streamlined]] design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at [[Eveleigh Railway Workshops|Eveleigh]] and [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] and were unstreamlined.\n\nThe 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by [[World War II]]. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare. It became known at the time as the ''Grey Nurse'' due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme. \n\n==In service==\n[[File:Railway Station - Stanmore (2715093301).jpg|thumb|left|3801 passes through [[Stanmore railway station, Sydney|Stanmore]] in 1945]]\nOn 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' for the first time.<ref name=Roundhouse>\"The 38 Class\" ''[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]]\" July 1981 pages 22-29</ref> When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the ''Melbourne Limited'' expresses between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]]. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A [[Waratah]] emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \"glamour workings\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38's. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).\n\nIn early 1963 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 28 June 1964. Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] in 1988.<ref>\"New Newcastle Speed Record\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' December 1988 page 437</ref> On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965 the locomotive was found to have serious [[boiler]] problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966 3801 returned to service, however the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the loco was withdrawn. Another boiler exam gave the loco a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' on 31 May 1969, as well as the ''[[Western Endeavour]]'' special across the continent to [[Perth]] between 22 August and 12 September 1970.<ref name=Roundhouse/> In October 1972, 3801 worked to [[South Australia]] with [[3642]] as part of celebrations to open the [[Whyalla railway line|Whyalla line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=William|title=Steel Wheels on Railway to Whyalla|date=1973|publisher=Austrail Publications|location=Bulli|isbn=0 909597 12 X}}</ref><ref name=Enviro>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807230 Locomotive, Steam 3801] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref>\n\nFrom April 1974 under the [[Public Transport Commission]] all steam trains were barred from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film ''[[A Steam Train Passes]]''.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:3801 walsh island.jpg|thumb|3801 under restoration at the [[State Dockyard]]]]\n[[File:3801 (NSW steam locomotive) 2.JPG|thumb|3801 at [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow station]] in January 2006]]\n[[File:3801 Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|3801 at [[Wagga Wagga railway station|Wagga Wagga station]] in June 2006 with a recreation of its original ''Grey Nurse'' colour scheme]]\n3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] to help raise money for survivors of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. After this 3801 was deeded to the Rail Transport Museum.  In June 1975, it hauled [[New South Wales D57 class locomotive|5711]] and [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|1905]] to [[Thirlmere railway station|Thirlmere]] when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.<ref>\"Museum on the Move\" ''Roundhouse'' June 1976 page 16</ref> The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal.\n\nIn November 1982 [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] [[Chief Executive]] of the [[State Rail Authority]] enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the [[South Maitland Railway]]s (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members - [[3820]] and [[3830]] (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) - and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.\n\nWith some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the [[State Dockyard]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company - an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|8111]] on an excursion train from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]].<ref>\"3801 Welcome back\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1986 pages 363-366</ref>\n\nThe firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The [[Tender locomotive|tender]] tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]]. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].<ref>\"Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986\" ''Railway Digest'' January 1987 page 30</ref>\n\nAfter restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by [[3801 Limited]] under a 20-year lease. During the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.<ref>\"3801 West\" ''Railway Digest'' July 1988 page 250</ref> In October 1988, [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']] arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.<ref name=Enviro/>\n\nOn 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the [[Cowan rail disaster]]. 3801 was struggling to climb the [[Cowan Bank]] (on the Sydney side of the [[Hawkesbury River]]) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a [[CityRail]] [[NSW TrainLink V set|Interurban]] passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.<ref>{{cite web|work=Emergency NSW | title=Cowan 1990| url=http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html|accessdate=8 December 2007\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120830/http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html\n|archivedate=2 October 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Emergency Management|title=Transport - Brooklyn Train Collision|url=http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180333/http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 3801 visited [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at [[Robertson railway station|Robertson]]. 3801 was a regular at the [[Hunter Valley Steamfest]].\n\nDespite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007.\n\n==2008-2020 overhaul==\nWhen 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs.<ref>{{cite web| work=Office of Rail Heritage | title=Office of Rail Heritage \u2013 Projects| url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects.htm| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Dampflokwerk Meiningen]] in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair.\n\nIn 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia.  Trial fitting of the boiler revealed a number of dimensional and technical issues which made it unsuitable for use.
