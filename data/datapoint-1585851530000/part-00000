As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 52,160.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22099.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The parish was founded in 1811.\n\nSt. Martin Parish is part of the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. 27% of the population of St. Martin Parish have [[French language|French]] fluency, rated as one of the highest concentrations of French speakers in the nation.\n\n==History==\nIn 1811, the division of [[Attakapas County, Orleans Territory|Attakapas Parish]] created St. Martin Parish and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]].  In 1824, St. Martin Parish was divided, resulting in the creation of [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]].  In 1844, St. Martin Parish was again divided, creating [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion Parish]].  In 1868, [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was formed from parts of St. Martin Parish and St. Mary Parish, literally dividing St. Martin Parish in two, as part of Iberia Parish runs between the two non-contiguous parts of St. Martin Parish.\n\nSt. Martin Parish was largely colonized by people from France and [[Acadia]] in the 1700s, accounting for the large concentration of French-speaking population today.  The Acadians brought with them the tale of Evangeline, a young woman who was separated from her supposedly-mortally-wounded betrothed during the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]]. According to the tale, Evangeline later met her betrothed in St. Martin Parish, but he had moved on to a new love and she never recovered from the shock of both finding him and losing him again.  [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s most famous work, [[Evangeline|'''''Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie''''']], was based on this story.  Evangeline was and remains an icon of Acadian and American culture.  The historical Evangeline, who is believed by some to have been an orphan girl named Emmeline Labiche, is supposed to have been buried on the grounds of the St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church in St. Martinville.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southwestlouisia00perr|title=Southwest Louisiana, biographical and historical|last=Perrin|first=William Henry|date=1891|publisher=New Orleans : Gulf Publishing Co.|others=The Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nSt. Martin was a very prosperous parish, growing rapidly in the early 1800s.  Most of the money at that time was being made by raising cattle.  Other profitable crops were cotton, sugar, corn, rice and tobacco.  These were sold to the New Orleans market.  Wealthy planters utilized slave labor on their plantations, and by 1860, there were over 7,000 slaves in the parish.\n\nA [[yellow fever]] epidemic in 1855, followed by a deadly fire and a destructive hurricane, ended an era of unbridled prosperity.  These events, combined with the effects of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] took a heavy toll on the parish.  However, the people proved resilient, and in short order became prosperous again.  Corn, cotton, and sugar cane ruled once more, and trees from the swamps were profitably sold.\n\n==Geography==\nThe parish is split into two non-contiguous parts because of a surveying error dating to 1868, when [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was created by the [[Louisiana Legislature]]. [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] divides St. Martin Parish into two separate areas, Upper and Lower St. Martin.  According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|816|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|738|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|79|sqmi}} (9.7%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>  St. Martin Parish is in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]], with [[Bayou Teche]] running through it.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 52,160.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22099.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The parish was founded in 1811.\n\nSt. Martin Parish is part of the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. 27% of the population of St. Martin Parish have [[French language|French]] fluency, rated as one of the highest concentrations of French speakers in the nation.\n\n==History==\nIn 1811, the division of [[Attakapas County, Orleans Territory|Attakapas Parish]] created St. Martin Parish and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]].  In 1824, St. Martin Parish was divided, resulting in the creation of [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]].  In 1844, St. Martin Parish was again divided, creating [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion Parish]].  In 1868, [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was formed from parts of St. Martin Parish and St. Mary Parish, literally dividing St. Martin Parish in two, as part of Iberia Parish runs between the two non-contiguous parts of St. Martin Parish.\n\nSt. Martin Parish was largely colonized by people from France and [[Acadia]] in the 1700s, accounting for the large concentration of French-speaking population today.  The Acadians brought with them the tale of Evangeline, a young woman who was separated from her supposedly-mortally-wounded betrothed during the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]]. According to the tale, Evangeline later met her betrothed in St. Martin Parish, but he had moved on to a new love and she never recovered from the shock of both finding him and losing him again.  [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s most famous work, [[Evangeline|'''''Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie''''']], was based on this story.  Evangeline was and remains an icon of Acadian and American culture.  The historical Evangeline, who is believed by some to have been an orphan girl named Emmeline Labiche, is supposed to have been buried on the grounds of the St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church in St. Martinville.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southwestlouisia00perr|title=Southwest Louisiana, biographical and historical|last=Perrin|first=William Henry|date=1891|publisher=New Orleans : Gulf Publishing Co.|others=The Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nSt. Martin was a very prosperous parish, growing rapidly in the early 1800s.  Most of the money at that time was being made by raising cattle.  Other profitable crops were cotton, sugar, corn, rice and tobacco.  These were sold to the New Orleans market.  Wealthy planters utilized slave labor on their plantations, and by 1860, there were over 7,000 slaves in the parish.\n\nA [[yellow fever]] epidemic in 1855, followed by a deadly fire and a destructive hurricane, ended an era of unbridled prosperity.  These events, combined with the effects of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] took a heavy toll on the parish.  However, the people proved resilient, and in short order became prosperous again.  Corn, cotton, and sugar cane ruled once more, and trees from the swamps were profitably sold.\n\n==Geography==\nThe parish is split into two non-contiguous parts because of a surveying error dating to 1868, when [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was created by the [[Louisiana Legislature]]. [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] divides St. Martin Parish into two separate areas, Upper and Lower St. Martin.  According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|816|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|738|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|79|sqmi}} (9.7%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>  St. Martin Parish is in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]], with [[Bayou Teche]] running through it.
