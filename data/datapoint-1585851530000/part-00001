Catholics number about 83,214 (2006 census). Parishes number 22 and the archdiocese extends over central New Zealand between Levin and Masterton in the north to Kaikoura to Westport in the south.<ref>[http://www.wn.catholic.org.nz/ Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington website] (retrieved 15 March 2011)</ref>\n\nThe suffragan sees are:\n\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Auckland]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin|Dunedin]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton in New Zealand|Hamilton in New Zealand]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Palmerston North]]\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Catholic Church in New Zealand}}\n\n===Pioneers===\nThe Catholic faith of the new immigrants to Wellington was initially sustained through the efforts of Dr John Fitzgerald who arrived on 31 January 1840. He led the Sunday prayers and organised [[Christian Doctrine]] classes. The first resident priest was the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Father Jeremiah O\u2019Riley who arrived as chaplain to [[Henry William Petre|Hon Henry William Petre]], a director of the [[New Zealand Company]] and one of the founders of Wellington. O\u2019Riley arrived in January 1843 and within a year the first, small Catholic church was built and dedicated to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]. Meanwhile, the Auckland-based French [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] ministered extensively throughout the country and Fr J.B. Compte SM established a permanent mission at [[Otaki, New Zealand|Otaki]] in 1844.<ref name=\"History\">\"History of the Archdiocese of Wellington\", Archdiocese of Wellington, 2006(?), pp. 1 and 2.</ref>\n\n===Marists===\nIn June 1848, [[Pope Pius IX]] divided New Zealand into two dioceses, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Auckland]] and Wellington which consisting of the lower half of the [[North Island]] and the whole of the [[South Island]]. [[Philippe Viard|Bishop Philippe Viard]], who arrived in Wellington on the barque \u201cClara\u201d on 1 May 1850, was the first Bishop. With him were five Marist priests, ten lay brothers, two lay male teachers, three M\u0101ori and four young women, the \u201cSisters of Mary\u201d who commenced teaching at what became [[St Mary's College, Wellington|St Mary's College]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral School, Thorndon|Sacred Heart Cathedral School]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Establishment===\nViard bought and was given land in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] on which his residence, St Mary's Convent and [[St Mary's Cathedral, Wellington|St Mary's Cathedral]]  were built. Fr Garin and Br Clause went to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] to establish the church there. Fr Lampila and two others established a mission in [[Hawkes Bay]]. Fr Forest and Mr Huntley worked in the [[Hutt Valley]]. Fathers Petitjean and Seon travelled extensively throughout the [[South Island]]. By 1852 a parish had been established in [[Whanganui]] and the M\u0101ori mission on the [[Whanganui River]] had a resident priest. For ten years, however, Viard received no reinforcements and illness took a toll on his personnel. In March 1860 the Sisters of Mercy arrived from Auckland to take over the works of the four Sisters of Mary.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1859 three more Marist priests arrived and pastors could be provided to [[New Plymouth]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]. The discovery of gold in 1857 and after meant a rapid expansion of the Church on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin|Dunedin]] became a separate diocese in 1869. Irish priests arrived and followed their compatriots to the [[gold mine|diggings]]. The [[Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions|Sisters of the Missions]] also arrived to establish schools in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] ([[Sacred Heart College (Napier)|Sacred Heart College Napier]] and [[St Joseph's M\u0101ori Girls' College]]) and in [[Christchurch]] and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Archdiocese===\nBishop Viard died on 2 June 1872 and was succeeded by [[Francis Redwood|Bishop Francis Redwood SM]], who remained ordinary of the Diocese for 61 years. The Diocese was raised to an Archdiocese on 10 May 1887 and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]] became a separate diocese. [[Thomas O'Shea (Archbishop of Wellington)|Thomas O\u2019Shea SM]] became his [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor Archbishop]] in 1913 and remained so for 22 years. Redwood died in 1935 and was succeeded by O\u2019Shea whose [[Bishop|archepiscopate]] lasted for 12 years. [[Peter McKeefry]] was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop in 1947 and succeeded on the death of O\u2019Shea in 1954. McKeefry was appointed a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1969 and was assisted by [[Owen Snedden|Bishop Owen Snedden]] who was [[auxiliary bishop]] from 1962.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Cardinals===\nDuring McKeefry's episcopate the Catholic population of Wellington more than doubled and 39 new parishes were established. New [[religious institute (Catholic)|orders]] arrived such as the [[Southern Star Abbey|Cistercians in Hawkes Bay]].  McKeefry, who became New Zealand's first cardinal in 1969, was succeeded in 1973 by [[Reginald Delargey|Cardinal Reginald Delargey]] who in turn was succeeded, on his death in 1979, by [[Thomas Williams (Archbishop of Wellington)|Archbishop Thomas Williams]], who became a cardinal in 1983. In 1980 the archdiocese was split with the creation of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Palmerston North Diocese]]. Williams retired in March 2005 and [[John Dew (Archbishop)|Archbishop John Dew]] was appointed as his replacement. He was appointed a cardinal in 2015.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Retrenchment===\nIn 2019 Cardinal Dew, addressing the state of the church's buildings and the future of their congregations, stated that soaring insurance costs and a dwindling number of priests meant that the resources of the archdiocese would have to be more efficiently used. He said that fewer resources would be poured into retaining buildings and more attention and energy focused on serving the poor, as required by [[Pope Francis]] and the [[Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod]]. He said that earthquake resilience issues meant that the archdiocese was liable for unsustainable insurance costs and the strengthening of buildings with unacceptable New Building Standard ratings. Already four churches and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] had been closed because of this. He also stated that some parishes would need to amalgamate to cope with the lack of clergy. He said that the reduced number of priests, which was accelerating each year, meant that in most parishes there was a single priest \u2013 often elderly \u2013 expected to minister in more than one church. Availability and ability of priests were highly significant factors governing decisions for the future that could not be delayed. Between 2013 and 2017 the archdiocese carried out a parish amalgamation process, which led to the reduction in parishes from 47 to 22, and many of the new parishes had too many churches, presbyteries, and other buildings.<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/111692890/cardinal-john-dew-calls-for-overhaul-of-catholic-church-in-wellington-archdiocese Tommy Livingston, \"Cardinal John Dew calls for overhaul of Catholic Church in Wellington Archdiocese\", ''Stuff News'', 1 April 2019] (Retrieved 02 April 2019)</ref>\n\n==Ordinaries==\nPhilippe Viard was [[vicar apostolic]] of the Diocese of Wellington from 1848 until 1860 when he became the Bishop of Wellington.
