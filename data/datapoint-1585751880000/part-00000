They are usually presented as a \"non-team\" of individualistic \"outsiders\" who, in their prior adventures, are known for following their own agendas. The team often battle [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[supernatural]] threats.\n\nIts original incarnation was led by [[Doctor Strange]] and included [[Hulk]], [[Namor]], and\u2014eventually\u2014[[Silver Surfer]]. They first appeared as the Defenders in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (Dec. 1971).\n\nThe group had a rotating line-up from 1972 until 1986, with Dr. Strange and the Hulk being usually constant members along with a number of other mainstays such as [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] and [[Luke Cage]], and many temporary members. The publication was retitled near the end of the run as ''The New Defenders'' but featured none of the original members and only Valkyrie, the Beast and the Gargoyle of the former long-term members. The concept was modified in the 1993\u201395 series ''Secret Defenders,'' in which Dr. Strange assembled different teams for each individual mission. The original team was reunited in a short-lived 2001 series by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Erik Larsen]]. In 2005 Marvel published a five-issue miniseries featuring the classic line-up by [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]]. In December 2011 writer [[Matt Fraction]] and artist [[Terry Dodson]] launched a ''Defenders'' series with a mixture of classic and new members, which lasted for 12 issues.\n\nA TV miniseries titled ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' premiered in 2017 on [[Netflix]], with the team consisting of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Marvel Feature 1 (1971).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (December 1971), featuring the first appearance of the team. Cover art by [[Neal Adams]].]]\nThe origin of the Defenders lies in two crossover story arcs by [[Roy Thomas]] prior to the official founding of the team. The first, in ''Doctor Strange'' #183 (November 1969), ''Sub-Mariner'' #22 (February 1970), and ''The Incredible Hulk'' #126 (April 1970) occurred due to the ''Dr. Strange'' series being canceled in the middle of a [[story arc]], leaving Thomas no choice but to resolve the storyline in other series that he wrote.<ref name=\"Back65\">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=3\u201316 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> In the story, Dr. Strange teams with Sub-Mariner and the Hulk to protect the Earth from invasion by [[H.

Barbara Norriss, later the host of the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], first appears in this story. In the second arc, featured in ''Sub-Mariner'' #34\u201335 (February\u2013March 1971), Namor enlists the aid of the Silver Surfer and the Hulk to stop a potentially devastating weather control experiment, inadvertently freeing a small island nation from a dictator and facing [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] under the name of the \"Titans Three\".<ref name=\"Back65\"/>\n\nThe Defenders first appeared as a feature in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (December 1971),<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 151|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= [Roy] Thomas and artist Ross Andru reunited [Doctor] Strange, the Hulk, and Namor as a brand new Marvel superhero team&nbsp;\u2013 the Defenders.\"}}</ref> where the founding members gather to battle the alien techno-wizard [[Yandroth]] and remain as a team afterward. Editor [[Stan Lee]], wanting to write all of the Silver Surfer's stories personally, had asked other writers not to use the character, and suggested that Thomas use Doctor Strange instead. Thomas has also speculated that Lee came up with the team's name: \"The 'Defenders' is far too passive a name for my taste.

They are usually presented as a \"non-team\" of individualistic \"outsiders\" who, in their prior adventures, are known for following their own agendas. The team often battle [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[supernatural]] threats.\n\nIts original incarnation was led by [[Doctor Strange]] and included [[Hulk]], [[Namor]], and\u2014eventually\u2014[[Silver Surfer]]. They first appeared as the Defenders in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (Dec. 1971).\n\nThe group had a rotating line-up from 1972 until 1986, with Dr. Strange and the Hulk being usually constant members along with a number of other mainstays such as [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] and [[Luke Cage]], and many temporary members. The publication was retitled near the end of the run as ''The New Defenders'' but featured none of the original members and only Valkyrie, the Beast and the Gargoyle of the former long-term members. The concept was modified in the 1993\u201395 series ''Secret Defenders,'' in which Dr. Strange assembled different teams for each individual mission. The original team was reunited in a short-lived 2001 series by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Erik Larsen]]. In 2005 Marvel published a five-issue miniseries featuring the classic line-up by [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]]. In December 2011 writer [[Matt Fraction]] and artist [[Terry Dodson]] launched a ''Defenders'' series with a mixture of classic and new members, which lasted for 12 issues.\n\nA TV miniseries titled ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' premiered in 2017 on [[Netflix]], with the team consisting of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Marvel Feature 1 (1971).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (December 1971), featuring the first appearance of the team. Cover art by [[Neal Adams]].]]\nThe origin of the Defenders lies in two crossover story arcs by [[Roy Thomas]] prior to the official founding of the team. The first, in ''Doctor Strange'' #183 (November 1969), ''Sub-Mariner'' #22 (February 1970), and ''The Incredible Hulk'' #126 (April 1970) occurred due to the ''Dr. Strange'' series being canceled in the middle of a [[story arc]], leaving Thomas no choice but to resolve the storyline in other series that he wrote.<ref name=\"Back65\">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=3\u201316 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> In the story, Dr. Strange teams with Sub-Mariner and the Hulk to protect the Earth from invasion by [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] interplanar beings known as the [[Undying Ones]] and their leader, the [[Nameless One (Marvel Comics)|Nameless One]]. Barbara Norriss, later the host of the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], first appears in this story. In the second arc, featured in ''Sub-Mariner'' #34\u201335 (February\u2013March 1971), Namor enlists the aid of the Silver Surfer and the Hulk to stop a potentially devastating weather control experiment, inadvertently freeing a small island nation from a dictator and facing [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] under the name of the \"Titans Three\".<ref name=\"Back65\"/>\n\nThe Defenders first appeared as a feature in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (December 1971),<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 151|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= [Roy] Thomas and artist Ross Andru reunited [Doctor] Strange, the Hulk, and Namor as a brand new Marvel superhero team&nbsp;\u2013 the Defenders.\"}}</ref> where the founding members gather to battle the alien techno-wizard [[Yandroth]] and remain as a team afterward. Editor [[Stan Lee]], wanting to write all of the Silver Surfer's stories personally, had asked other writers not to use the character, and suggested that Thomas use Doctor Strange instead. Thomas has also speculated that Lee came up with the team's name: \"The 'Defenders' is far too passive a name for my taste. I prefer more aggressive-sounding names like the 'Avengers' or the 'Invaders,' so Stan probably came up with that one.\"<ref name=\"Back65\"/> Due to the popularity of their tryout in ''Marvel Feature'', Marvel soon began publishing ''The Defenders'' with [[Steve Englehart]] writing and [[Sal Buscema]] penciling,<ref>Sanderson \"1970s\" in Gilbert (2008), p.&nbsp;156: \"The Defenders moved into their own bimonthly comic book with ''The Defenders'' #1, written by Steve Englehart and penciled by Sal Buscema.\"</ref> while Thomas moved into the editor's seat.
