Both can occur if gallstones leave the gallbladder, pass through the [[cystic duct]], and get stuck in the [[common bile duct]]. The common bile duct drains the liver and pancreas, and a blockage there can lead to inflammation and infection in both the pancreas and biliary system. While cholecystectomy is not usually the immediate treatment choice for either of these conditions, it is often recommended to prevent repeat episodes from additional gallstones getting stuck.<ref name=\"Goldman2011\" />{{rp|940,1017}}\n\n===Gallbladder cancer===\n[[Gallbladder cancer]] (also called carcinoma of the gallbladder) is a rare indication for cholecystectomy. In cases where cancer is suspected, the open technique for cholecystectomy is usually performed.<ref name=EssentialSurg2015/>\n\n===Liver transplantation===\nIn [[living donor liver transplantation]] between adults, a cholecystectomy is performed in the donor because gallbladder interferes with removal of the right (lateral) lobe of the liver and to prevent the formation of gallstones in the recipient.<ref>[https://www.nebraskamed.com/transplant/liver/after-operation What to expect after your liver transplant]</ref><ref>[https://www.umms.org/ummc/health-services/transplant/organ/liver/living-donor Living Donor Liver Transplant]</ref> The gallbladder is not removed in [[pediatric]] transplantations as the left lobe of the liver is used instead.<ref>[https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/education/liver_donor_the_donation_surgery/ Liver Donors FAQ: The Donation Surgery]</ref>\n\n==Contraindications==\nThere are no specific contraindications for cholecystectomy, and in general it is considered a low-risk surgery. However, anyone who cannot tolerate surgery under general anesthesia should not undergo cholecystectomy. People can be split into high and low risk groups using a tool such as the [[ASA physical status classification system|ASA physical status]] classification system. In this system, people who are ASA categories III, IV, and V are considered high risk for cholecystectomy.

Experts agree that this is the preferred treatment for people with gallstones but no symptoms.<ref name=\"Consensus2015\" /> Conservative management may also be appropriate for people with mild biliary colic, as the pain from colic can be managed with pain medications like [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDS]] (ex: ketorolac) or [[opioid]]s.<ref name=\"AFP2014\" />\n\nConservative management for acute cholecystitis involves treating the infection without surgery.

ERCP is often used to retrieve stones stuck in the common bile duct in patients with gallstone pancreatitis or cholangitis. In this procedure, an endoscope, or small, long thin tube with a camera on the end, is passed through the mouth and down the throat. The doctor advances the camera through the stomach and into the first part of the small intestine to reach the opening of the bile duct. The doctor can inject a special, radiopaque dye through the endoscope into the bile duct to see stones or other blockages on x-ray.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007479.htm|title=ERCP: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>  ERCP does not require general anaesthesia and can be done outside of the operating room. While ERCP can be used to remove a specific stone that is causing a blockage to allow drainage, it cannot remove all stones in the gallbladder. Thus, it is not considered a definitive treatment and people with recurrent complications from stones will still likely need a cholecystectomy.\n\n=== Cholecystostomy ===\n[[Cholecystostomy]] is the drainage of the gallbladder via insertion of a small tube through the abdominal wall. This is usually done using guidance from imaging scans to find the right place to insert the tube. Cholecystostomy can be used for people who need immediate drainage of the gallbladder but have a high risk of complications from surgery under general anaesthesia, such as elderly people and those with co-existing illnesses.<ref name=\"Gurusamy_2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurusamy KS, Rossi M, Davidson BR | title = Percutaneous cholecystostomy for high-risk surgical patients with acute calculous cholecystitis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 8 | pages = CD007088 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23939652 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007088.pub2 }}</ref> Draining pus and infected material through the tube reduces inflammation in and around the gallbladder.

Both can occur if gallstones leave the gallbladder, pass through the [[cystic duct]], and get stuck in the [[common bile duct]]. The common bile duct drains the liver and pancreas, and a blockage there can lead to inflammation and infection in both the pancreas and biliary system.

However, anyone who cannot tolerate surgery under general anesthesia should not undergo cholecystectomy.

In this system, people who are ASA categories III, IV, and V are considered high risk for cholecystectomy.

Experts agree that this is the preferred treatment for people with gallstones but no symptoms.<ref name=\"Consensus2015\" /> Conservative management may also be appropriate for people with mild biliary colic, as the pain from colic can be managed with pain medications like [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDS]] (ex: ketorolac) or [[opioid]]s.<ref name=\"AFP2014\" />\n\nConservative management for acute cholecystitis involves treating the infection without surgery. It is usually only considered in patients at very high risk for surgery or other interventions listed below. It consists of treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids.<ref name=\"Gurusamy_2013\" />\n\n=== ERCP ===\n[[File:Detailed diagram of an endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) CRUK 001.svg|thumb|In ERCP, the endoscope enters through the mouth and passes through the stomach and start of the small intestine to reach the bile ducts.]]\n[[File:Cholangiogram with labels.jpg|thumb|This is a [[Cholangiography|cholangiogram]], an x-ray of the bile ducts using contrast medium to make the bile ducts visible. 1 - Duodenum. 2 - Common bile duct. 3 - Cystic duct. 4 - Hepatic duct.

ERCP is often used to retrieve stones stuck in the common bile duct in patients with gallstone pancreatitis or cholangitis. In this procedure, an endoscope, or small, long thin tube with a camera on the end, is passed through the mouth and down the throat. The doctor advances the camera through the stomach and into the first part of the small intestine to reach the opening of the bile duct. The doctor can inject a special, radiopaque dye through the endoscope into the bile duct to see stones or other blockages on x-ray.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007479.htm|title=ERCP: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>  ERCP does not require general anaesthesia and can be done outside of the operating room. While ERCP can be used to remove a specific stone that is causing a blockage to allow drainage, it cannot remove all stones in the gallbladder. Thus, it is not considered a definitive treatment and people with recurrent complications from stones will still likely need a cholecystectomy.\n\n=== Cholecystostomy ===\n[[Cholecystostomy]] is the drainage of the gallbladder via insertion of a small tube through the abdominal wall. This is usually done using guidance from imaging scans to find the right place to insert the tube. Cholecystostomy can be used for people who need immediate drainage of the gallbladder but have a high risk of complications from surgery under general anaesthesia, such as elderly people and those with co-existing illnesses.<ref name=\"Gurusamy_2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurusamy KS, Rossi M, Davidson BR | title = Percutaneous cholecystostomy for high-risk surgical patients with acute calculous cholecystitis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 8 | pages = CD007088 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23939652 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007088.pub2 }}</ref> Draining pus and infected material through the tube reduces inflammation in and around the gallbladder.
