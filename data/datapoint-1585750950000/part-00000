The situation came to a head when Michigan petitioned for [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1835 and sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries. Both sides passed legislation attempting to force the other side's capitulation, while Ohio's [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor]] [[Robert Lucas (governor)|Robert Lucas]] and Michigan's 24-year-old \"Boy [[Governors of Michigan Territory|Governor]]\" [[Stevens T. Mason]] helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to the other's authority. Both states deployed militias on opposite sides of the [[Maumee River]] near [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], but besides mutual taunting, there was little interaction between the two forces. The single military confrontation of the \"war\" ended with a report of shots being fired into the air, incurring no casualties.\n\nDuring the summer of 1836, Congress proposed a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and about three-quarters of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Although the northern region's mineral wealth would later become an economic asset to Michigan, at the time the compromise was considered a poor outcome for the new state, and voters in a statehood convention in September soundly rejected the proposal. But in December, the Michigan government, facing a dire financial crisis and pressure from Congress and President [[Andrew Jackson]], called another convention (called the \"Frostbitten Convention\") which accepted the compromise that resolved the Toledo War.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Northwest territory.png|thumb|right|Map of the [[Northwest Territory]] as established by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in the [[Northwest Ordinance]], shown with present-day state borders, and correct spatial relationship between Lakes Michigan and Erie]]\n\nIn 1787, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]], which created the [[Northwest Territory]] in what is now the upper [[Midwestern United States]].

Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes only via Lakes Michigan, [[Lake Huron|Huron]], and [[Lake Superior|Superior]].<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\">{{harvp|Mendenhall|Graham|1895|pp=127, 154}}</ref>\n\n{{wikisource2| The Northwest Ordinance}}{{wikisource2| Enabling act for Ohio 1802}}During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, the delegates allegedly received reports from a [[fur trapping|fur trapper]] that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than had previously been believed (or mapped). Thus, it was possible that an east-west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of [[Maumee Bay]], or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\" />\n{{wikisource2|Ohio Constitution of 1802}}\n\nAddressing this contingency, the Ohio delegates included a provision in the draft Ohio constitution that if the trapper's report about Lake Michigan's position was correct, the state boundary line would be angled slightly northeast so as to intersect Lake Erie at the \"most northerly cape of the Miami [Maumee] Bay\". This provision would guarantee that most of the [[Maumee River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]] and all of the southern shore of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would fall in Ohio.<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\"/> The draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by the United States Congress, but before Ohio's admission to the Union in February 1803, the proposed constitution was referred to a [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].

U.S. Surveyor General [[Edward Tiffin]], who was in charge of the survey, was a former Ohio governor. As a result, Tiffin employed surveyor William Harris to survey not the Ordinance Line, but the line as described in the Ohio Constitution of 1802.

One such canal system approved by the Ohio legislature in 1825 was the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] that included a connection to the Ohio River and an outflow into Lake Erie via the Maumee River.<ref name=\"MSU\"/>\n\nDuring the conflict over the Toledo Strip, the [[Erie Canal]] was built, linking [[New York City]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] to the Great Lakes at [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The canal finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into [[boomtown]]s.<ref name=\"Meinig1\">{{harvp|Meinig|1993|pp=357, 363, 436, and 440}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Erie Canal inspired many other canal projects. Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and [[Illinois]], Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value. Detroit was {{convert|20|mi|km}} up the Detroit River from Lake Erie, and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south. Because of this, Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals, and later railroads, than was Toledo. From this perspective on the rapidly developing Midwest of the 1820s and 1830s, both states had much to gain by controlling the land in the Toledo Strip.<ref name=\"Meinig1\"/>\n\nIn addition, the Strip west of the Toledo area is a prime location for [[agriculture]], because of its well-drained, fertile [[loam]] soil. The area had for many years produced large amounts of [[maize|corn]] and [[wheat]] per acre.<ref name=\"historicperrysburg.org\"/> Michigan and Ohio both wanted what seemed strategically and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region.<ref name = \"ohiohistory_Graham_p154\"/>\n\n== Prelude to conflict ==\n[[File:Robert Lucas circa 1838 sketch.png|thumb|right|upright|Ohio governor Robert Lucas (1832\u20131836)]]\n\nIn 1820\u201321, the [[Public Land Survey System|federal land surveys]] had reached the disputed area from two directions, progressing southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio.

The Ohio Congressional delegation was active in blocking Michigan from attaining statehood, lobbying other states to vote against Michigan. In January 1835, frustrated by the political stalemate, Michigan's acting territorial Governor [[Stevens T.

At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen [[U.S. representative]]s and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial [[swing state]] in presidential elections, and it would have been devastating to the fledgling [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to lose Ohio's electoral votes.

Before his replacement arrived, Mason ordered 1,000 Michigan militiamen to enter Toledo and prevent the symbolically important first session of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas.

Residents disliked him so much they burned him in [[effigy]] and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw [[Isaac E. Crary]] chosen as Michigan's first [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate.

The situation came to a head when Michigan petitioned for [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1835 and sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries. Both sides passed legislation attempting to force the other side's capitulation, while Ohio's [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor]] [[Robert Lucas (governor)|Robert Lucas]] and Michigan's 24-year-old \"Boy [[Governors of Michigan Territory|Governor]]\" [[Stevens T. Mason]] helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to the other's authority. Both states deployed militias on opposite sides of the [[Maumee River]] near [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], but besides mutual taunting, there was little interaction between the two forces. The single military confrontation of the \"war\" ended with a report of shots being fired into the air, incurring no casualties.\n\nDuring the summer of 1836, Congress proposed a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and about three-quarters of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Although the northern region's mineral wealth would later become an economic asset to Michigan, at the time the compromise was considered a poor outcome for the new state, and voters in a statehood convention in September soundly rejected the proposal.

This provision would guarantee that most of the [[Maumee River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]] and all of the southern shore of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would fall in Ohio.<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\"/> The draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by the United States Congress, but before Ohio's admission to the Union in February 1803, the proposed constitution was referred to a [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].

The canal finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into [[boomtown]]s.<ref name=\"Meinig1\">{{harvp|Meinig|1993|pp=357, 363, 436, and 440}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Erie Canal inspired many other canal projects. Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and [[Illinois]], Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value. Detroit was {{convert|20|mi|km}} up the Detroit River from Lake Erie, and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south. Because of this, Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals, and later railroads, than was Toledo.

Residents disliked him so much they burned him in [[effigy]] and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw [[Isaac E. Crary]] chosen as Michigan's first [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] chosen by the state legislature in November, [[Lucius Lyon]] and [[John Norvell]], were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.<ref name=\"DMVA\"/>\n\n[[File:Bilde-frost.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Journal of the 1836 Michigan Territorial Convention, often called the Frostbitten Convention]]\nOn June 15, 1836, Jackson signed a bill that allowed Michigan to become a state, but only after it ceded the Toledo Strip.

Delegates passed a resolution to accept the terms set forth by the Congress. The calling of the convention was itself controversial. It had only come about because of an upswelling of private summonses, petitions, and public meetings. Since the legislature did not approve a call to convention, some said the convention was illegal. [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] boycotted the convention. As a consequence, the resolution was rejected and ridiculed by many Michigan residents.<ref name=\"Wittkeopcit\" /> Congress questioned the legality of the convention, but accepted the results of the convention regardless of its concerns.

Re-survey protocol would ordinarily require the surveyors to follow the Harris line exactly, but in this case, the surveyors deviated from the line in places. This prevented the situation of certain residents near the border being subject to changes in state residence, or land owners having parcels on both sides of the border. The 1915 survey was delineated by 71 [[granite]] markers, {{convert|12|in|cm}} wide by {{convert|18|in|cm}} high. Upon completion, the two states' governors, [[Woodbridge N. Ferris]] of Michigan and [[Frank B.

Many old north\u2013south roads are offset as they cross the line, forcing traffic to jog east while traveling north. The line is identified on [[United States Geological Survey]] [[topographical map]]s as the \"South [Boundary] Michigan Survey\", and on Lucas County and Fulton County road maps as \"Old State Line Road\".<ref>{{cite map |url= http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&S=14&Z=17&X=82&Y=1440&W=1&qs=%7cToledo%7cOhio%7c |title= 2&nbsp;km NE of Wilkins, Ohio, United States |date= July 1, 1983 |author= [[United States Geological Survey]] |publisher= [[Microsoft Research Maps]] |accessdate= May 13, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |author= [[Ohio Department of Transportation]] |url= http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/ProgramMgt/functionalclass/2004%20Rural%20County%20Maps/Lucas.pdf |title= Lucas County, Ohio |format= PDF |location= Columbus |publisher= Ohio Department of Transportation |scale= Scale not given |accessdate= October 5, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101229063315/http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/ProgramMgt/functionalclass/2004%20Rural%20County%20Maps/Lucas.pdf |archivedate=December 29, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the border on land was firmly set in the early 20th century, the two states were still in disagreement on the path of the border to the east, in Lake Erie.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009903290308 |last= Kienzle |first= Javan |title= How Ohio's Grab for the Maumee River Blocked Michigan's Road to Statehood |date= March 29, 2009 |work= [[Detroit Free Press]] }}</ref> In 1973, the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters.
