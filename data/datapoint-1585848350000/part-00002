It is the second-highest [[mountain]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], after [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=CAG/>\n\nAdams, [[#Exploration|named for]] President [[John Adams]], is a member of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], and is one of the arc's largest volcanoes,<ref name=\"Scott\"/> located in a remote wilderness approximately {{convert|34|mi|km|0}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref name=Wood1990/> The [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] consists of the upper and western part of the volcano's cone. The eastern side of the mountain is designated as part of the territory of the [[Yakama Nation]].<ref name=\"Mt. Adams Wilderness\"/><ref name=YNSite/>\n\nAdams' asymmetrical and broad body rises {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] traverses the western flank of the mountain.<ref name=USFSAdamsPCT/><ref name=USFSPCTWA/>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===General===\n[[File:Mt Adams from south - Wasco County Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Adams from [[Wasco County, Oregon]]]]\n\nMount Adams stands {{convert|37|mi|km}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]] and about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of [[Mount Rainier]]. It is {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of the [[Columbia River]] and {{convert|55|mi|km}} north of [[Mount Hood]] in [[Oregon]]. The nearest major cities are [[Yakima]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the northeast, and the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metropolitan area, {{convert|60|mi|km}} to the southwest. Between half and two thirds of Adams is within the [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] of the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]. The remaining area is within the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] of the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. While many of the volcanic peaks in Oregon are located on the Cascade Crest, Adams is the only active volcano in Washington to do so. It is farther east than all the rest of Washington's volcanoes except [[Glacier Peak]].<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\nAdams is one of the long-lived [[stratovolcano|volcano]]es in the [[Cascade Range]], with minor activity beginning 900,000 years ago and major cone building activity beginning 520,000 years ago. The whole mountain has been completely eroded by glaciers to an elevation of {{convert|8200|ft|m}} twice during its lifetime. The  current cone was built during the most recent major eruptive period 40,000\u201310,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Simcoes/>\n\nStanding at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, Adams towers about {{convert|9800|ft|m}} over the surrounding countryside. It is the second-highest mountain in Washington and third-highest in the [[Cascade Range]]. Because of the way it developed, it is the largest stratovolcano in Washington and second-largest in the Cascades, behind only [[Mount Shasta]]. Its large size is reflected in its {{convert|18|mi|km}}-diameter base, which has a prominent north-south trending axis.<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\n[[File:Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness 03.JPG|thumbnail|left|Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness]]\nAdams is the source of the headwaters for two major rivers, the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] and [[White Salmon River]]. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs at its base flow into two more major river systems, the [[Cispus River]] and the [[Klickitat River]]. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the [[Cowlitz River]] near [[Riffe Lake]], and the Lewis River.\n\nTo the south, the White Salmon River has its source on the lower flanks of the west side of Adams and gains additional flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, at some point in their courses, provide essential [[irrigation]] water for [[farming]] and [[ranching]]. The [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]] rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon)<ref name=Haring/> and [[Check dam|erosion control]] (Klickitat).<ref name=Keller/><ref name=KH_DEIS/> The [[Cispus River|Cispus]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis]] rivers have been [[Dam|impounded]] with dams farther downstream for [[flood control]] and [[hydroelectricity|power generation]] purposes.\n\nMount Adams is the second-most isolated, in terms of access, stratovolcano in Washington; [[Glacier Peak]] is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. [[U.S. Route 12|Highway 12]] passes about 25 miles to the north of Adams through the Cascades. [[Washington State Route 141|Highway 141]] comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the [[Columbia River]] to the small town of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance.<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec/><ref name=AdamsRec/> Access to the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles.<ref name=YNRecArea/> Two small towns, [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.\n\nIts size and distance from major cities, and the tendency of some people to forget or ignore Mount Adams, has led some people to call this volcano \"The Forgotten Giant of Washington.\"<ref name=Harris/>{{rp|237}}\n\nOn a clear day from the summit, other visible volcanoes in the [[Cascade Range]] include [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]] to the north, [[Mount St. Helens]] to the west, all in Washington; and [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]], [[Mount Thielsen]], [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]], [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]], and [[Mount McLoughlin]], all to the south in [[Oregon]].<ref name=WTAClimbTR/><ref name=Lyman1/>\n\n===Summit area===\nContrary to legend, the flatness of Adams' current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano's peak. Instead it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit, Pikers Peak, rises {{convert|11657|ft|m|sigfig=4}} on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about {{convert|600|ft|m|sigfig=2}} higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava and [[scoria]] cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress descending from the false summit to an elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=1}}. This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late [[Pleistocene]]. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from the Adams and White Salmon glaciers. On the east side, The Castle is a low prominence at the top of Battlement Ridge. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Mount Adams Summit Panorama.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view from the relatively flat summit area of Mount Adams, with the center of the image looking due west towards Mount St. Helens. Six [[Cascade Volcanoes]] are visible (not including Adams itself). From left to right: [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]].}}\n\n===Flank terrain features===\nProminent ridges descend from the mountain on all sides. On the north side, the aptly named North Cleaver comes down from a point below the summit [[ice cap]] heading almost due north. The Northwest Ridge and West Ridge descend from the Pinnacle, to the northwest and west, respectively. Stagman Ridge descends west-southwest from a point about halfway up the west side and turns more southwest at about {{convert|6000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. South of Stagman Ridge lies Crofton Ridge. Crofton gradually becomes very broad as it descends southwesterly from the tree line. MacDonald Ridge, on the south side, starts at about tree line below the lower end of Suksdorf Ridge and descends in a southerly direction.\n\nThree prominent ridges descend from the east side of the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is farthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The farthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\nSeveral rock prominences exist on the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence near the bottom of Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\n===Glaciers===\n[[File:Mt. Adams Glaciers above Bird Creek Meadows.JPG|thumb|Heavily crevassed glaciers on the southeast side of the mountain]]\n[[File:USGS Glaciers of Mount Adams Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.45|Glaciers of Mount Adams]]\n\nIn the early 21st century, glaciers cover a total of 2.5% of Adams' surface. During the last [[ice age]] about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Mount Adams has 209 perennial snow and ice features and 12 officially named glaciers. The total ice-covered area makes up {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2}}, while the area of named glaciers is {{convert|7.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/>  Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Klickitat Glacier|Klickitat]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]]) originate from Adams' summit ice cap.<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Reid1/>\n\nOn the northwest face of the mountain, [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] cascades down a steep channel in a series of [[icefall]]s before spreading out and terminating at around the {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} elevation, where it becomes the source of the Lewis River and Adams Creek, a tributary of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=Guardians/> Its eastern lobe ends at a small glacial [[tarn (lake)|tarn]], Equestria Lake. In the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], Adams Glacier is second in size only to [[Carbon Glacier]] on [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Wood\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\n[[File:Upper Portion of the Adams Glacier.JPG|thumb|Deep crevasses and icefalls on Adams Glacier]]\n\nThe [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[White Salmon Glacier (Mount Adams)|White Salmon]], and [[Avalanche Glacier|Avalanche]] glaciers on the west side of the mountain are less thick and voluminous, and are generally patchy in appearance. They all originate from [[cirques|glacial cirques]] below the actual summit. Although the White Salmon Glacier does not originate from the summit [[ice cap]], it does begin very high on the mountain at about {{convert|11600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. In the early 1900s, a portion of it descended from the summit ice cap,<ref name=Reid1/> but volume loss has separated it. Some of its glacial ice feeds the Avalanche Glacier below it to the southwest while the rest tumbles over some large cliffs to its diminutive lower section to the west. The White Salmon and Avalanche Glaciers feed the many streams of the Salt Creek and Cascade Creek drainages, which flow into the [[White Salmon River]]. The Pinnacle Glacier is the source of a fork of the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] as well as Riley Creek, which is also a tributary of the Lewis River.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe south side of the mountain along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small [[Gotchen Glacier]] and the [[Crescent Glacier (Mount Adams)|Crescent Glacier]]. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the [[White Salmon River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe rugged east side has four glaciers, the [[Mazama Glacier (Mount Adams)|Mazama Glacier]], [[Klickitat Glacier]], [[Rusk Glacier]], and the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]]. During the last [[Ice Age]], they carved out two immense canyons: the Hellroaring Canyon and the Avalanche Valley. This created the Ridge of Wonders between the two. Of the four glaciers on the east side, the Mazama Glacier is the farthest south and begins between the Suksdorf Ridge and Ridge of Wonders at about {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Near its terminus, it straddles the Ridge of Wonders and a small portion feeds into the Klickitat Glacier. The glacier gains more area from additional glacier ice that collects from drifting snow and avalanches below the Suksdorf Ridge as the ridge turns south. The Mazama Glacier terminates at about {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and is the source of Hellroaring Creek, which flows over several waterfalls before it joins Big Muddy Creek. [[Klickitat Glacier]] on the volcano's eastern flank originates in a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} wide [[cirque]] and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around {{convert|6600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, where it becomes the source of Big Muddy Creek, a tributary of the [[Klickitat River]]. The Rusk Glacier does not start from the summit ice cap, but starts at {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice from the summit cap. It is enclosed on the south by Battlement Ridge and Victory Ridge on the north and terminates at about {{convert|7100|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is the source of Rusk Creek, which flows over two waterfalls before joining the Big Muddy on its way to the Klickitat. The Wilson Glacier, like the Rusk Glacier, starts below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice; however, the Wilson Glacier starts slightly higher at about {{convert|10800|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is also fed by an arm of the Lyman Glacier as it flows down from the summit ice cap. The Wilson Glacier terminates at {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} where it is the source of Little Muddy Creek, another tributary of the Klickitat.<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe north side is distinguished by two major glaciers, the [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]] and [[Lava Glacier|Lava]] Glaciers. Like the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]], the Lyman Glacier is characterized by deep [[crevasse]]s and many [[icefall]]s as it cascades down from the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Guardians/> It is divided into two arms by a very rugged ridge at {{convert|10200|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and terminates at {{convert|7400|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The [[Lava Glacier]] originates in a large cirque below the summit at about {{convert|10000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, sandwiched between the North Cleaver on the west and the Lava Ridge to the east. It terminates at about {{convert|7600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The Lava and Lyman Glaciers are the source of the Muddy Fork of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe total glacier area on Mount Adams decreased 49%, from {{convert|31.5|km2|order=flip}} to {{convert|16.2|km2|order=flip}}, between 1904 and 2006, with the greatest loss occurring before 1949. Since 1949, the total glacier area has been relatively stable with a small amount of decline since the 1990s.<ref name=Treser/><ref name=\"Sitts\"/>\n\n===Surrounding area===\n[[File:Mt. Adams from the south.JPG|left|thumb|Aerial view of the south face from across the [[Columbia River Gorge]]]]\nMount Adams is surrounded by a variety of other volcanic features and [[volcano]]es. It stands near the center of a north-south trending volcanic field that is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|30|mi|km}} long, from just south of the [[Goat Rocks]] to Guler Mountain, the vent farthest south in the field. This field includes over 120 vents; about 25 of these are considered flank volcanoes of Mount Adams. The largest flank volcano is a [[basalt]]ic [[shield volcano]] on Adams east base called Goat Butte. This structure is at least 150,000&nbsp;years old.\nLittle Mount Adams is a symmetrical [[cinder cone]] on top of the Ridge of Wonders on Adams' southeast flank.<ref name=AdamsNatHistory/>\n\nPotato Hill is a cinder cone on Adams' north side that was created in the late [[Pleistocene]] and stands {{convert|800|ft|m|sigfig=2}} above its lava plain.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\nLavas from its base flowed into the Cispus Valley where they were later modified by glaciers.  At the {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} level on Adams' south flank is South Butte. The lavas associated with this structure are all younger than Suksdorf Ridge but were emplaced before the end of the last ice age.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\n[[File:Simulating Trout Lake, Klickitat County, Washington.jpg|thumbnail|right|Trout Lake (Trout Lake Creek) reflecting Mount Adams near the small town of Trout Lake]]\n\nSeveral relatively young obvious lava flows exist in the area around Adams. Most of these flows are on the north side of the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe many other vents and volcanoes encompassed by the Mount Adams field include Glaciate Butte and Red Butte on the north, King Mountain, Meadow Butte, Quigley Butte, and Smith Butte on the south, with others interspersed throughout.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nLocated a few miles north of Adams is [[Goat Rocks Wilderness]] and the heavily eroded ruins of a [[stratovolcano]] that is much older than Adams. Unlike Adams, the [[Goat Rocks]] volcano was periodically explosive and deposited [[volcanic ash|ash]] 2.5&nbsp;million years ago that later solidified into {{convert|2100|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=2}} thick [[tuff]] layers.<ref name=CascadesVolcanosObservatory/>\n\nIn the area surrounding Mount Adams, many caves have formed around inactive lava vents.<ref name=Lyman1/>  These caves are usually close to the surface and can be hundreds of feet deep and wide.<ref name=NYTCaves/> A few of the more well known caves include the [[Cheese Cave]], Ice Cave, and Deadhorse Caves. Cheese Cave has the largest bore of the caves near Adams with a diameter of {{convert|40|-|50|ft|m}} and a length of over {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.<ref name=Caldwell1953/> Ice cave, which is made up of several sections created by several [[sinkhole]]s, has an ice section that is {{convert|120|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|-|30|ft|m}} in diameter and noted for its ice formations.<ref name=Lyman2/><ref name=AdamsOuting1913/> From the same entrance, the tube continues another {{convert|500|ft|m}} to the west.<ref name=IceCaveWA/><ref name=CavesOfWA/> Deadhorse Cave is a massive network of lava tubes. It the most complex [[lava tube]] in the United States with {{convert|14441|ft|m}} of passage.<ref name=OregonGrotto/> These caves are all just outside of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. These and many other caves in the Trout Lake area were at one time part of a huge system that originated at the [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]]. The most obscure caves around Adams are the Windholes on the southeast side near Island Cabin Campground.<ref name=windholes/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Takh Takh Lava Flow.png|thumb|Takh Takh Lava Flow below Mount Adams]]\nAdams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} diameter base which is elongated in its north-south axis and covers an area of {{convert|250|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The volcano has a volume of {{convert|70|cumi|km3|sigfig=2}} placing it second only to [[Mount Shasta]] in that category among the [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] stratovolcanoes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>  Mount Adams was created by the subduction of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]], which is located just off the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Harris/>\n\nMount Adams was born in the mid to late [[Pleistocene]] and grew in several pulses of mostly [[lava]]-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy and minor activity, during which, [[glacier]]s eroded the mountain to below {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. [[Potassium-argon dating]] has identified three such eruptive periods; the first occurring 520,000&nbsp;to 500,000 years ago, the second 450,000&nbsp;years ago, and the third 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/> Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the [[volcano]], consist of [[lava flows]] with little [[tephra]]. The loose material that makes up much of Adams' core is made of [[breccia]]ted lava.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[Andesite]] and [[basalt]] flows formed a {{convert|20|to|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|adj=on}} thick circle around the base of the Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with handful of [[dacite]] and [[pyroclastic flow]]s which erupted early in Adams' development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last [[ice age]]. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily [[erosion|eroded]] [[andesite]] fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into [[clay]]s (mostly [[kaolinite]]), [[iron oxide]]s, [[sulfur]]-rich compounds and [[quartz]].<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\nThe present eruptive cone above {{convert|7000|ft|m}} was constructed sometime between 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least ten times, generally from above {{convert|6500|ft|m}}. One of the more recent flows issued from South Butte and created the {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500-year-old [[Mount St. Helens]] ash on it, meaning it is at least that old.<ref name=\"Wright\"/> Of a similar age are the Takh Takh Meadows and Muddy Fork lava flows. The lowest vent to erupt since the main cone was constructed is Smith Butte on the south slope of Adams. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams is an approximately 1000-year-old flow that emerged from a vent at about {{convert|8200|ft|m}} on Battlement Ridge.<ref name=Harris/>\n[[File:Mount Adams Volcano Hazard Zones.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Mount Adams, Washington simplified hazards map showing potential impact area for ground-based hazards during a volcanic event.]]\n\nThe Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large [[debris flow]] from Adams and the only large one since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} of the [[White Salmon River]] valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest [[avalanche]] on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} and its debris covered about {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|1}} of the upper Salt Creek area.<ref name=Slide/> Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/> This was the only debris flow in Mount Adams' recorded history, but there are five known lahars.<ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\nSince then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including [[hydrogen sulfide]]) have occurred especially on the summit plateau and indicate that Adams is [[Volcano#Dormant|dormant]], not [[Volcano#Extinct|extinct]]. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of [[andesite]] or [[basalt]]. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams tend to have a low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens and some of the other Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large [[landslide]]s and other debris flows.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams rock and ice debris avalanche.jpg|thumb|Rock and ice debris avalanche that occurred on October 20, 1997 on the east side of Mount Adams.]]\nIn 1997, Adams experienced two slides seven weeks apart that were the largest slides in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], ignoring the catastrophic [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens]], since a slide that occurred on [[Little Tahoma]] in 1963.<ref name=avalanche/> The first occurred at the end of August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three miles down the [[Klickitat Glacier]] and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as {{convert|6.5|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of material.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]] is located between St. Helens and Adams and within the [[Indian Heaven Wilderness]]. Its principal feature is an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} long linear zone of [[shield volcano]]es, [[cinder cone]]s, and flows with volumes of up to {{convert|23|cumi|km3}} with the highest peak, [[Lemei Rock]]. The shield volcanoes, which form the backbone of the volcanic field, are located on the northern and southern sides of the field. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are on the western and the eastern sides.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nTo the east, across the [[Klickitat River]], lies the [[Simcoe Mountains|Simcoe Mountains volcanic field]]. This area contains many small shield volcanoes and cinder cones of mainly [[alkali basalt|alkalic intraplate basalt]] with fractionated intermediate alkalic products, subordinate subalkaline [[mafic]] lavas, and several [[rhyolite]]s as secondary products. There are about 205 vents that were active between 4.2 million and 600 thousand years ago.<ref name=Simcoes/>\n\n[[Seismic activity]] around Adams is very low and it is one of the quietest volcanoes in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is monitored by the [[Pacific Northwest Seismic Network]] and the [[Cascades Volcano Observatory]] via a [[seismic station]] on the southwest flank of the mountain.<ref name=CVO_Seismic/>\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Mount Adams summit area.jpg|thumbnail|right|The South Climb, or South Spur climbing route on Mount Adams along Suksdorf Ridge]]\nLike many other [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] volcanoes, Mount Adams offers many recreational activities, including mountain climbing, hiking and backpacking, berry picking, camping, [[boating]], [[fishing]], [[rafting]], [[photography]], wildlife viewing, and scenic driving among other things.<ref name=\"Mt.

The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, [[Takhlakh Lake]], [[Olallie Lake (Washington)|Ollalie Lake]], and [[Horseshoe Lake (Washington)|Horseshoe Lake]]; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive [[camping]] as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to [[motorcycle]]s. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers [[boating]] and [[fishing]] opportunities on several of the lakes.<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec/><ref name=WDFWLakes/>\n\nOn the south side of Adams, the Morrison Creek area provides additional opportunities for hiking, backpacking, [[biking]], and equestrian sports with several long loop trails. A few small primitive campgrounds exist in the area including the Wicky Creek Shelter. Generally, there are trailheads at these campgrounds.<ref name=AdamsRec/>\n\n{{main|Mount Adams Recreation Area}}\nOn the southeast side of the mountain, the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]], another very popular area, offers activities such as [[hiking]], [[camping]], [[picnicking]], and [[fishing]].

The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription on a rock at Piker's Peak indicates. \"You are a piker if you think this is the summit. Don't crab, the mountain was here first.\"<ref name=Smoot/> [[Crampons]] and [[ice axe]]s are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route's steepness. Aside from [[crevasse]]s on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep [[headwall]]s of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, [[avalanche]]s, [[altitude sickness]], and inexperience. [[Mountaineering|Climbing]] Mount Adams can be dangerous for a variety of reasons and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.<ref name=Smoot/><ref name=KATU_Adams/><ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Beckey/>\n\n====Routes====\nThere are 25 main routes to the summit with alternates of those main routes.<ref name=Wilderness.net/> They range in difficulty from the relatively easy non-technical South Spur (South Climb) route to the extremely challenging and dangerous Victory Ridge, Rusk Glacier Headwall, and Wilson Glacier Headwall routes up Roosevelt Cliff.<ref name=Beckey/><ref name=summitpost/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |{{nowrap|Routes up Mount Adams (Clockwise from the south)<ref name=Smoot/><ref name=Beckey/><ref name=summitpost/>}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Route Name !! scope=\"col\" | Grade ([[Yosemite Decimal System|YDS]], [[Grade (climbing)#WI numeric scale|AIRS]]) !! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| South Spur (South Climb) || I || Most popular route on Adams; non-technical; first climbed in 1863 or 1864\n|-\n| Southwest Chute || I || Steep scree or snow climb; first climbed in 1965\n|-\n| [[Avalanche Glacier]] Headwall || I || Steep scree or snow climb; first climbed in 1976\n|-\n| Avalanche-[[White Salmon Glacier (Mount Adams)|White Salmon Glacier]] || I || Moderate glacier and scree climb; first climbed in 1957\n|-\n| West Ridge || I, Class 2 || Steep ridge climb; first climbed in 1963\n|-\n| [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle Glacier]] Headwall || II, Class 4 || Steep unstable rock or snow climb; first climbed in 1965\n|-\n| Northwest Ridge || II || Steep ridge climb; first climbed in 1924\n|-\n| North Face of Northwest Ridge || II || Steep rock or snow climb; first climbed in 1967\n|-\n| [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] to NW Ridge || II, AI2 || Steep rock and glacier climb\n|-\n| Adams Glacier || II, AI2 || Classic, difficult, steep glacier climb; first climbed in 1945\n|-\n| Stormy Monday Couloir || III, Class 4\u20135 || Steep unstable rock or snow climb; first climbed in 1975\n|-\n| North Ridge Headwall || II, Class 4 || Steep unstable rock or snow climb; first climbed in 1960\n|-\n| North Cleaver || II, Class 2\u20133 || Steep ridge climb; likely route of first ascent in 1854\n|-\n| [[Lava Glacier]] Headwall West || II, Class 4 || Steep unstable rock or snow climb; first climbed in 1965\n|-\n| Lava Glacier Headwall East || II, Class 4 || Steep unstable rock or snow climb; first climbed in 1960\n|-\n| Lava Ridge || II, Class 2\u20133 || Steep ridge climb; first climbed in 1961\n|-\n| [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman Glacier]] North Arm || II, AI2 || Difficult, steep glacier climb; first climbed in 1948\n|-\n| Lyman Glacier South Arm || III, AI2 || Difficult, steep glacier climb; first climbed in 1966\n|-\n| [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]] || III, AI2 || Difficult, steep glacier climb; first climbed in 1961\n|-\n| Wilson Glacier Headwall || IV, Class 4 || Very steep, unstable rock and glacier climb; first climbed in 1961\n|-\n| Victory Ridge || IV-V, Class 4\u20135 || Very steep, unstable rock and glacier climb; first climbed in 1962\n|-\n| [[Rusk Glacier]] Headwall || IV, Class 4 || Very steep, unstable rock and glacier climb; first climbed in 1978\n|-\n| Battlement Ridge || III, Class 3\u20134 || Steep glacier and unstable rock climb; first climbed in 1921<ref name=Rusk/>\n|-\n| South Side of Battlement Ridge || III, Class 3\u20134 || Steep unstable rock climb; first climbed in 1934\n|-\n| [[Klickitat Glacier]] || III, Class 3\u20134, AI2 || Difficult, steep glacier climb; first climbed in 1938\n|-\n| Klickitat Headwall || III, Class 3\u20134, AI2 || Steep unstable rock and ice climb; first climbed in 1971\n|-\n| South Klickitat Glacier || III, Class 3\u20134, AI2 || Difficult, steep glacier climb; first climbed in 1962\n|-\n| [[Mazama Glacier (Mount Adams)|Mazama Glacier]] || I || Easy glacier climb\n|-\n| Mazama Glacier Headwall || II, AI2 || Shorter, more direct alternate from the Mazama Glacier route\n|}\n\n===Hiking===\nWhile the summit is the main draw for many who visit Adams,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} many trails pass through the area around Mount Adams where visitors can find extensive vistas, local history, displays of wildflowers, [[lava flows|lava]] formations, and several [[waterfall]]s.\n\nOne such trail is the unofficially named \"Round the Mountain Trail\" that encircles Mount Adams and is approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} long.<ref name=Spring /> It is called the \"Round the Mountain Trail\" unofficially because it is made up of three different named trails and an area where there is no trail.

On the south, the Shorthorn Trail #16 leaves from near the Morrison Creek Campground and the South Climb Trail #183 starts at Cold Springs Trailhead/Campground and heads up the South Spur, the most popular climbing route to the summit. On the west side, there are three trails going up: the Stagman Ridge Trail #12, [[Pacific Crest Trail]] #2000, and the Riley Creek Trail #64. There are four trails providing access to the \"Round the Mountain Trail\" on north side: the Divide Camp Trail #112, Killen Creek Trail #113, Muddy Meadows Trail #13, and the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] again as it heads down the mountain to the north. These trails accessing the \"Round the Mountain Trail\" generally gain between {{convert|1500|ft|m}} and {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in between {{convert|3|mi|km}} and {{convert|6|mi|km}}.

Like several other trails around Adams, this trail has extensive views of the mountain. Other trails, like the Takh Takh Meadows Trail #136, pass through meadows and old [[lava flow]]s. One of the longest trails on the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest|Gifford Pinchot]], Boundary Trail #1, has its eastern terminus in the Midway High Lakes area at Council Lake. Other trails in the area include the Council Bluff Trail #117, Green Mountain Trail #110, and East Canyon Trail #265.<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec/><ref name=GrnTrl/>\n\nSeveral long trails pass through the Morrison Creek area on the south side of the mountain. The Snipes Mountain Trail #11 follows the eastern edge of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed from the lower end for 6 miles to the Round the Mountain Trail.

There are three sno-parks on Mount Adams south slope: Snow King, Pineside, and Smith Butte Sno-parks. The south side of the mountain, especially the A.G. Aiken Lava Bed, is especially popular with [[snowmobile]]rs and [[Cross-country skiing|ski]]ers. The Mount Adams Recreation Highway (FR 80) is plowed all the way to Pineside and Snow King Sno-parks at about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} elevation for most of the year, as long as there is enough money in the Forest Service's winter budget. Smith Butte Sno-park, at about {{convert|4000|ft|m}}, is accessible in low-snow years. Most of the time, the road is not plowed all the way to Smith Butte. The [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] does this in order to not dry up the forest service's snowplowing funds.<ref name=\"Mt.

According to the [[Bridge of the Gods (geologic event)|Bridge of the Gods]] tale, Wy'east ([[Mount Hood]]) and Pahto (Mount Adams; also called Paddo or Klickitat by native peoples) were the sons of the [[Great Spirit]]. The brothers both competed for the love of the beautiful La-wa-la-clough ([[Mount St. Helens]]). When La-wa-la-clough chose Pahto, Wy'east struck his brother hard so that Pahto's head was flattened and Wy'east took La-wa-la-clough from him (thus attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance).<ref name=Harris/> Other versions of the story state that losing La-wa-la-clough caused Pahto such grief that he dropped his head in shame.<ref name=Scott1997/><ref name=CVO_Volcano_Names/><ref name=Hill/>\n\nIn a legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitats]], the chief of the gods, Tyhee Saghalie, came to [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] with his two sons. The sons quarreled about who would settle where. To settle the dispute, Saghalie shot an arrow to the west and to the north and told his sons to find them and to settle where the arrows had fallen. So one settled in the [[Willamette Valley]] and the other in the area between the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River]]s and they became the ancestors of the [[Multnomah people|Multnomah]] and [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] tribes respectively. To separate the tribes, Saghalie raised the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]]. He also created the \"[[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]]\" as a way for the tribes to meet with one another easily. A \"witch-woman,\" whose name was Loowit, lived on the bridge and had control of the only fire in the world. She wanted to give the tribes fire to improve their condition and Saghalie consented. He was so pleased with Loowit's faithfulness that he offered Loowit whatever she wanted. She asked for youth and beauty and Saghalie granted her wish. Suitors came from near and far until finally she could not decide between Klickitat and Wiyeast. Klickitat and Wiyeast went to war over the matter until finally Sahalie decided to punish them for creating such chaos. He broke the Bridge of the Gods and put the three lovers to death. However, in order to honor their beauty, he raised up three mountains: Wiyeast (Hood), Klickitat (Adams), and Loowit (St. Helens).<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Lyman4/><ref name=Lyman5/><ref name=Lyman6/><ref name=ORNativeSon/>\n\nIn a similar legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitats]], there was a large inland sea between the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at [[Mount Multnomah]], one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled disputes among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), sons of the [[Great Spirit]] Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda's calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the [[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]] was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was in another part of the world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as [[Mount St. Helens]]. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.<ref name=Sterrett/>\n\n[[File:Thunderbird on Totem Pole.jpg|thumb|upright|Thunderbird on a Totem Pole]]\nThe [[Yakama]]s also have a legend attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the [[Goat Rocks]]), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now the first to be greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee ([[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]]) convinced Wyeast ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken with the rest of the mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The [[Great Spirit]] had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.<ref name=WAHistoryOnline/>\n\nIn many of the legends of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], there are [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s that live on them and Adams is no exception. This particular thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized the inhabitants of the land. Speelyi, the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.<ref name=Lyman4/>\n\nSeveral other tribes have legends involving battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz]] and [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]] have a legend where [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]] and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]] were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, St. Helens was the man and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the [[Yakama]]s has a terrific battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), Low-we-lat-Klah (St. Helens), and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.<ref name=Clark/>\n\n===Exploration===\nAdams was known to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal languages ([[Plateau Penutian languages|Plateau Penutian]], [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]]), Pahto means ''high up'', ''very high'', ''standing up'', or ''high sloping mountain''.<ref name=ORNativeSonML/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/> The [[Klickitat people#Name|Klickitat name]] is of [[Sahaptin language#Dialects|Klickitat]] origin and comes from the [[Chinookan]] for ''beyond''.\n\nIn 1805, on the journey westward down the [[Columbia River|Columbia]], the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] recorded seeing the mountain; noting that it was \"a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow\"<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> and thought it \"perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.\"<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> They initially misidentified it as [[Mount St. Helens]], which had been previously discovered and named by [[George Vancouver]]. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it \"a very high humped mountain\".<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/>\n\nFor several decades after Lewis and Clark sighted the mountain, people continued to get Adams confused with [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]], due in part to their somewhat similar appearance and similar [[latitude]]. In the 1830s, [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the [[Cascade Range]] as the President's Range and rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. [[Mount Hood]], in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President [[John Adams]] and St. Helens was to be renamed after [[George Washington]]. In a mistake or deliberate change by mapmaker and proponent of the Kelley plan, [[Thomas J. Farnham]], the names for Hood and St. Helens were interchanged. And, likely because of the confusion about which mountain was St. Helens, he placed the ''Mount Adams'' name north of Mount Hood and about {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of Mount St. Helens. By what would seem sheer coincidence, there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed.<ref name=CVO_Adams/> However, it was not official until 1853, when the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], under the direction of [[Washington Territory]] governor [[Isaac I. Stevens]], determined its location, described the surrounding countryside, and placed the name on the map.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Beckey/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/>\n\nSince its discovery by explorers, the height of Adams has also been subject to revision. The topographer for the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], Lt. [[Johnson K. Duncan]], and [[George Gibbs (ethnologist)|George Gibbs]], ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought it was about the same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation.<ref name=Beckey/> The [[Canada\u2013United States border#The Northwest Boundary Survey (1857\u201361)|Northwest Boundary Survey]] listed Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|9570|ft|m}}<ref name=Beckey/>  while a later [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] gave it an elevation of {{convert|11906|ft|m}}.<ref name=HistorianReport/> The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the [[Mazamas|Mazamas mountaineering club]], William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and [[William Gladstone Steel]]. Using a [[Hypsometer#Pressure hypsometer|boiling point thermometer]], [[Barometer#Mercury barometers|mercurial barometer]], and an [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]], they determined the elevation to be {{convert|12255|,|12402|, and|12150|ft|m}} respectively.<ref name=Elevation/> None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the [[US Geological Survey]] (USGS), using a [[triangulation]] method, also measured the height of several mountains in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and they measured Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|12470|ft|m}}.<ref name=NatGeo/> The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to {{convert|12307|ft|m}} and again in 1970 to {{convert|12276|ft|m}} for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, is generated by the new method, [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]], for calculating altitudes.\n\n[[Claude Ewing Rusk]], a local settler and [[mountaineer]], was one of those most familiar with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle [[glacier]]s. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman<ref name=Rusk/> and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone.<ref name=Beckey/> While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.<ref name=Rusk/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams (Washington) Map 1901 Reid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Reid's map from his survey of Adams in 1901]]\nNo detailed descriptions of Adams or its [[glacier]]s existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams to be the source of some of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia River basalt flows]]. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous [[caldera]] that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the [[anticline]] ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley.<ref name=Lyman2/> Modern [[geology]] has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the [[Mazamas]] in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896.<ref name=Lyman7/> Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted [[geologist]]/[[glaciologist]] [[Harry Fielding Reid]] to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant [[glacier]]s, [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Lava Glacier|Lava]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[Rusk Glacier|Rusk]] with suggestions from Rusk.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Beckey/> He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte.<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Reid2/> Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the [[Little Ice Age]].<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Reid2/> The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nOn the 1895 [[Mazamas]] expedition, the first [[heliograph]]y between several of the peaks of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] was attempted with some success. A party on [[Mount Hood]] was able to communicate back and forth with the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], [[Mount Baker|Baker]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Jefferson]], and [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]] were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and logistical problems.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=HistorianReport/><ref name=Wells/>\n\n[[File:Cascadians Climbing Party east side Mount Adams (Washington).jpg|thumb|left|Cascadians climbing party before starting the ascent of the east side of Adams]]\nThe first ascent of Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken,<ref name=AikenName/> [[Edward Jay Allen]], and Andrew J. Burge.<ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/><ref name=Hazard/> While most sources list the aforementioned names, at least one substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge.<ref name=Guardians/> Their route was likely up the North Cleaver because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through [[Naches Pass]], which is to the north of Adams.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nWhile the north and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the mountain were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and [[icefall|ice cascades]].<ref name=Guardians/> To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, [[C. E. Rusk]] searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]], Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily [[crevasse]]d eastern side of the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Rusk/> One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was \"thrilling to the point of extreme danger.\"<ref name=Hazard/> Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Coursen/> Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the [[Mazamas]] finally climbed the west face of Adams.<ref name=WestAscent/> This route is straightforward, but made difficult by [[icefall]]s, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.<ref name=Hazard/>\n\nSome of the caves around Adams were subject to commercial ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] in years of short supply elsewhere.<ref name=CondonCaves/> Oddly, a \"claim\" to the cave using mining laws was used in order to gain exclusive access to the ice.<ref name=IceCaveWA/> [[Cheese Cave]] was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, for a number of years in the 1950s, a [[bleu cheese]] similar to the [[Roquefort]] produced in [[Roquefort-sur-Soulzon]], France.<ref name=Caldwell1953/><ref name=Cheese/><ref name=Halliday/> A legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]]s regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the \"mouse-wife,\" they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man's wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the \"mouse-wife\" to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nAdams was the feature of a 1915 documentary \"When the Mountains Call.\" This film documented the journey from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to the summit and showed many of the sights along the way.<ref name=Movie/>\n\n===Forest Service operations===\n[[File:Gotchen Creek Guard Station.jpg|thumb|left|Gotchen Creek Guard Station ca. 1911]]\nAdams and the lands surrounding it were initially set aside as part of the [[Mount Rainier Forest Reserve]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], was created under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the [[Rainier National Forest]] was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the [[Columbia National Forest]]. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, [[Gifford Pinchot]]. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.<ref name=GPNF_History/>\n\nAdams is home to the oldest building on the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]], the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area.<ref name=EarToTheGround/> In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large [[wildfire]], the [[Cold Springs Fire]], although fire crews were able to stop the fire before it got too close. Wildfires in 2012 ([[Cascade Creek Fire]]) and 2015 ([[Cougar Creek Fire]]) also required this precaution, and fire crews were able to stop them as well.<ref name=mailonline/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams Lookout.jpg|thumb|right|US Forest Service lookout on the summit, August 9, 1922.]]\nIn 1916, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] began preparations to establish the highest [[Fire lookout tower|fire lookout]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] at the top of Adams. This was part of an endeavor that began in 1915 on [[Mount Hood]]<ref name=HoodLO/> and 1916 on [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]<ref name=StHelensLO/> The idea was to situate lookouts far above all low-lying hills and mountains to give the lookouts an immense area for observation without obstructions. Being at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, the new lookout would also be the third highest in the world and still is.<ref name=showtell/> In 1917, building materials were moved to the base of the mountain and in 1918, Dan Lewis packed the building materials and lumber to the lower portion of Suksdorf Ridge.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The following summer was spent hauling the building materials to the top.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The four men assigned the job, Arthur \"Art\" Jones, Adolph Schmid, Julius Wang, and Jessie Robbins, had a difficult task ahead of them until they engineered a way to quickly and, for the most part, safely bring the building materials up the slope using a deadman/rope technique.<ref name=MtnMen/> Construction of the standard D-6 building with a \u00bc second story cupola<ref name=Abegg/> began in the summer of 1920 and was completed a year later by Art, Adolph, James Huffman and Joe Guler.<ref name=Rusk/> It was manned as a lookout during the last year of its construction through 1924. After which it was abandoned because of the difficulties of operating a [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] that high and because lower level clouds, smoke, and haze frequently and effectively blocked the view of the lower elevations. Arthur Jones was likely the one person most involved in the project, spending five seasons on the mountain. Others who worked on the project or staffed the lookout include Rudolph Deitrich, the last [[fire lookout|lookout]], and Chaffin \"Chafe\" Johnson.<ref name=MtnMen/>\n\nAfter the [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] at the summit was abandoned, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] changed strategies from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as [[airplane]]s became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate.<ref name=WashingtonLO/><ref name=SWWALO/> One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer<ref name=BurleyMtn/> and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending.<ref name=Abegg/><ref name=ORLive/> Two lookouts remain nearby on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high [[National Fire Danger Rating System|fire danger]].<ref name=Abegg/>\n\n===Sulfur mine===\nIn 1929, Wade Dean formed the Glacier Mining Company and filed [[mining claim]]s to the [[sulfur]] on Adams' {{convert|210|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first assessment work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to {{convert|210|ft|m}} thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, it could not be carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made over the course of the mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] [[fire lookout tower|lookout]], a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed {{convert|8|by|12|ft|m}} [[lean-to]] was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above {{convert|12000|ft|m}} could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of {{convert|110|F|C}} recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of {{convert|-48|F|C}}. This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit [[ice cap]]. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean's desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959.<ref name=MtnMen/>  Adams is the only large [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Level IV ecoregions, Cascades.png|thumb|upright|Level IV ecoregions, Cascades]]\nBecause of its remote location and relative inaccessibility, [[Climate Data Records|climate records]] are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, has only been measuring [[precipitation]] since 1982 and [[temperature]]s since 1989.<ref name=PHWeather/> [[Temperature record|Temperature]] and precipitation records from [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], both considerably lower in [[elevation]] and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood<ref name=AdamsCOOP/> and 1924 at Trout Lake.<ref name=NWS/> [[Snow]]fall records from the three [[Snow hydrology#Equipment and Testing|snow station]]s on Adams cover a number of years but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950\u20131976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report snow depth.<ref name=PHWeather/> The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956\u20131978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962\u20131978. Divide Meadow was the most representative of the snow depth on the west side of Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\nLike the rest of the high [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] mountains, Adams receives a large amount of snow, but because it lies farther east than many of its [[Washington (state)|Washington]] compatriots, it receives less than one might expect for a mountain of its height. Although snowfall is not measured directly, it can be estimated from the [[Snow#Snowfall measurement|snow depth]]; and since the Potato Hill station was upgraded to report daily snow depth in 2006, there has been an average of {{convert|210|in|cm}} of snow every year. Also since 2006, the most snow to fall in a day was {{convert|28|in|cm}} (Feb 26, 2011), in a month, {{convert|92|in|cm}} (Dec 2007), and in a year, {{convert|288|in|cm}} (2012).<ref name=PHWeather/>\n\n[[File:Lenticular clouds over Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|Towering [[lenticular cloud]]s over Mount Adams]]\nBy April, there is, on average, {{convert|89|in|cm}} of snow on the ground at Potato Hill.<ref name=PHWeather/> The average monthly snow depth at Potato Hill has not changed much from the records collected from 1950\u20131976 with only a small decrease in January, February, and May and a small increase in March and April. Records from Council Pass and Divide Meadow also show depth increasing throughout the winter, peaking in April. These two stations average a greater amount of snow than Potato Hill, with an average of {{convert|102|in|cm}} at Council Pass and {{convert|141|in|cm}} at Divide Meadow by April. Divide Meadow generally receives the most snow with a record depth of {{convert|222|in|cm}} in 1972. The [[snowpack]] at Potato Hill starts building in late October to early November and the last of the snow generally melts by the beginning of June, but occasionally lingers into July.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\n[[Temperature]]s and [[precipitation]] can be highly variable around Adams, due in part to its geographic location astride the Cascade Crest, which gives it more of a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental.2Fmicrothermal climates|continental]] influence than some of its neighbors.

[[climate]] of Adams gives it a large amount of diversity within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, [[Abies grandis|grand fir]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|Douglas fir]] dominate the forest with [[Tsuga heterophylla|Western hemlock]] and [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] are dominant with some patches of dense [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]] and [[Abies procera|noble fir]]; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases, the forest changes again with [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]], [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]], and [[Tsuga mertensiana|mountain hemlock]] becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine]] and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are [[Pinus monticola|Western white pine]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]], [[Larix occidentalis|Western larch]], [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]], [[Cupressus nootkatensis|Alaska cedar]], and [[Juniperus communis|mountain juniper]]. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species [[Acer macrophyllum|big leaf maple]], [[Quercus garryana|Oregon white oak]], [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]], [[Populus trichocarpa|black cottonwood]], and [[Alnus rubra|red alder]]. Large shrubs/small trees include the [[Betula glandulosa|dwarf birch]], [[Crataegus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's hawthorn]], [[Corylus cornuta|California hazelnut]], [[Prunus emarginata|bitter cherry]], [[Acer circinatum|vine maple]], [[Acer glabrum|Douglas maple]], and [[Sambucus cerulea|blue elderberry]] and contribute to a vibrant fall display.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=flora2/>\n\n[[Big Tree (Washington)|Big Tree]], (also known as Trout Lake Big Tree), is a massive [[Ponderosa pine|ponderosa]] pine tree in majestic, [[old growth]] pine and fir forests at the southern base of Mount Adams.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> The tree rises to a lofty {{convert|202|ft|m}}<ref name=\"richard1\"/>  with a diameter of {{convert|7|ft|m}},<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/> and is one of the largest known ponderosa pine trees in the world.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> As of 2015, however, the tree has been stressed by attacks from [[Bark beetle|pine beetle]]s.<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/>\n\nThe large diversity of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the [[Herbaceous plant|herbage]] and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is more than any other mountain in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by [[Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf|William Suksdorf]] and [[Thomas J. Howell (botanist)|Thomas Howell]] and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts.<ref name=flora/> This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed.<ref name=flora2/> Adams is home to many rare plants including [[Actaea elata|tall bugbane]], [[Mimulus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's monkeyflower]], northern microseris (''[[Microceris borealis]]''), Brewer's potentilla (''[[Potentilla breweri]]''), and [[Sisyrinchium sarmentosum|mountain blue-eyed grass]].<ref name=flora2/> The plant diversity is most evident in the many [[meadow]]s and [[wetland]]s on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, [[Castilleja parviflora|magenta paintbrush]], [[Senecio triangularis|arrowleaf ragwort]], [[penstemon]]s, [[Lupinus|lupine]]s, [[Mimulus|monkeyflower]]s, [[Phyllodoce (plant)|mountain heather]]s, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find [[Vaccinium uliginosum|bog blueberry]], [[Viburnum edule|highbush cranberry]], [[Drosera anglica|sundew]], [[Comarum palustre|purple cinquefoil]], and [[Utricularia intermedia|flatleaf bladderwort]], in addition to many [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[Juncaceae|rush]]es. [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|Subalpine]] and [[Montane ecology#Alpine grasslands and tundra|alpine]] meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a display as well with [[Luetkea|partrigefoot]], Cascade [[Boechera|rockcress]], [[subalpine buttercup]], [[Valeriana sitchensis|Sitka valerian]], [[Smelowskia ovalis|alpine false candytuft]], [[Polemonium elegans|elegant Jacob's ladder]], and various [[Polygonaceae|buckwheat]]s as prominent players.<ref name=Friends/>\n\n===Fauna===\n[[File:Hoary marmot Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|[[Hoary marmot]] above the tree line on Adams]]\nAdams is home to a fairly wide variety of animal species. Several [[hoofed mammals]] call the mountain home: [[mountain goat]]s, [[Roosevelt elk]], [[black-tailed deer]], and [[mule deer]]. Large carnivores include [[cougar]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[coyote]], [[bobcat]], and the [[Red fox#Subspecies|Cascade mountain fox]],<ref name=CCP/> an endemic subspecies of the [[red fox]]. There have also been sightings of [[wolverine]]<ref name=CCP/><ref name=Wolverine_Oregonian /> and unconfirmed reports of [[Gray wolf|wolves]].<ref name=WDFWWolf/> Many small mammals also make Adams their home. [[Squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s are numerous throughout the forest. [[Douglas squirrel]]s, [[least chipmunk]]s, and [[Townsend's chipmunk]]s live throughout the forest with [[golden-mantled ground squirrel]]s and [[California ground squirrel]]s occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive [[pine marten]]s that also call Adams their home. [[Hoary marmot]]s and [[pika]]s make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive [[snowshoe hare]] lives throughout the forest.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=CCP/><ref name=Lyman3/><ref name=animals/>\n\nThe profusion of wildflowers attracts a large number of [[pollinator]]s including [[butterflies]] such as [[Parnassius|Apollos]], ''[[Melitaea]]'', ''[[Coenonympha]]'', [[Neophasia menapia|snowflakes]], [[Painted lady|painted ladies]], [[Pieris (butterfly)|garden whites]], [[Papilio|swallowtails]], [[Skipper (butterfly)|skippers]], [[Limenitis|admirals]], [[Coliadinae|sulphurs]], [[Lycaenidae|blues]], and [[List of fritillaries (butterflies)|fritillaries]].<ref name=animals/><ref name=Butterflies/>\n\n[[File:Gray-crowned rosy finch Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|[[Grey-crowned rosy finch|Gray-crowned rosy finch]] high up the slopes on Adams]]\nMany birds call Adams home or a stopover on their migration routes. Songbirds include three species of [[chickadee]], two [[kinglet]]s, several [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]]es, [[warbler]]s, [[American sparrow|sparrow]]s, and [[finch]]es. One unique [[songbird]] to the high elevations is the [[grey-crowned rosy finch|gray-crowned rosy finch]], who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. [[Raptor (bird)|Raptors]] that live in the forest and meadows include ''[[Accipiter]]''s, [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[golden eagle|golden]] and [[bald eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[great horned owl]]s, and [[falcon]]s. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the [[hairy woodpecker]], [[downy woodpecker]], and [[white-headed woodpecker]]. Jays such as the [[Steller's jay]] and [[Canada jay]] are common and the Canada jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the [[Clark's nutcracker]] with its distinctive call. [[Swallow]]s and [[swift]]s are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. [[Common merganser]]s and several other species of [[water bird]]s can be found on many of the lakes as well. The [[American dipper]] with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several [[grouse]] species, the [[sooty grouse|sooty]], [[spruce grouse|spruce]], and [[ruffed grouse]] and the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=animals/><ref name=MountaineerBirds/>\n\nThe streams and lakes around Adams offer a number of [[fish]] for the [[Angling|angler]] to seek out. The two most common species, [[eastern brook trout]] and [[rainbow trout]] ([[Columbia River redband trout]]), are in nearly every lake and stream. [[Brown trout]] and [[cutthroat trout]] appear in most of the lakes in the [[Midway High Lakes Area|High Lakes Area]] and three lakes are home to [[tiger trout]]. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of [[trout]].<ref name=WDFWFish/> [[Bull trout]] can be found in the upper reaches of the [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]]s.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> [[Westslope cutthroat trout]] can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the [[Cispus River]]. [[mountain whitefish|Whitefish]] can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and [[Cowlitz River]]s, falls on the [[White Salmon River]]), the only river where [[anadromous fish]]es can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. [[Chinook salmon]], [[coho salmon]], and [[steelhead]], in several different [[Salmon run|run]]s, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.<ref name=YKFP/>\n\nThe [[Conboy Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] lies at the base of Mount Adams. The refuge covers {{convert|6500|acres|ha}} and contains conifer forests, grasslands, and shallow wetlands. Protected wildlife includes [[deer]], [[elk]], [[beaver]], [[coyote]], [[otter]], small [[rodent]]s, [[bald eagle]], greater [[sandhill crane]], and the [[Oregon spotted frog]].<ref name=USFWS_CLNWR/> It and the lands nearby are home to several rare and threatened species of plants and animals including the previously mentioned Oregon spotted frog and greater sandhill crane, [[Astragalus pulsiferae|Suksdorf's milk vetch]], [[Orthocarpus bracteosus|rosy owl's-clover]], [[Eryngium|Oregon coyote thistle]], [[Polites mardon|Mardon skipper]], [[peregrine falcon]], and [[Western gray squirrel]].<ref name=FWSRare/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mountains|Volcanoes}}\n*[[List of mountain peaks of North America]]\n**[[List of mountain peaks of the United States]]\n***[[List of Ultras of the United States]]\n***[[List of volcanoes in the United States]]\n***[[List of highest points in Washington by county]]\n*[[Geology of the Pacific Northwest]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"ngs\">{{cite ngs |pid=SB1004 |name=Mount Adams |accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=peakbagger>{{cite peakbagger |pid=2365 |title=Mount Adams, Washington |accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=CAG>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.climbingwashington.com/features/wahighest.htm\n |title       = Washington's 100 highest Mountains\n |publisher   = Cascade Alpine Guide\n |accessdate  = 2008-12-21\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172523/http://www.climbingwashington.com/features/wahighest.htm\n |archivedate = 2008-05-11\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=AdamsRec>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31184\n| title = Mount Adams Area\n| work = Gifford Pinchot National Forest\n| publisher = [[United States Forest Service|USFS]]\n| date = 2015-11-24 | accessdate = 2016-02-17\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160204183043/http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31184\n| archivedate= 2016-02-04}}</ref>\n<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31180\n| title = Cowlitz Valley Area\n| work = Gifford Pinchot National Forest\n| publisher = [[United States Forest Service|USFS]]\n| date = 2015-10-24 | accessdate = 2016-02-17\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160113140220/http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31180\n| archivedate= 2016-01-13}}</ref>\n<ref name=BurleyMtn>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=31222\n| title = Trail #256 Burley Mountain\n| work = Gifford Pinchot National Forest\n| publisher = [[United States Forest Service|USFS]]\n| date = 2015-11-24 | accessdate = 2016-03-21}}</ref>\n<ref name=YNSite>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.yakamanation-nsn.gov/\n| title = Official Site of the Yakama Nation\n| accessdate = 2012-05-21 }}</ref>\n<ref name=USFSAdamsPCT>\n{{cite web\n| title = Pacific Northwest Region Viewing Area - Mt.

It is the second-highest [[mountain]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], after [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=CAG/>\n\nAdams, [[#Exploration|named for]] President [[John Adams]], is a member of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], and is one of the arc's largest volcanoes,<ref name=\"Scott\"/> located in a remote wilderness approximately {{convert|34|mi|km|0}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref name=Wood1990/> The [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] consists of the upper and western part of the volcano's cone. The eastern side of the mountain is designated as part of the territory of the [[Yakama Nation]].<ref name=\"Mt. Adams Wilderness\"/><ref name=YNSite/>\n\nAdams' asymmetrical and broad body rises {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] traverses the western flank of the mountain.<ref name=USFSAdamsPCT/><ref name=USFSPCTWA/>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===General===\n[[File:Mt Adams from south - Wasco County Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Adams from [[Wasco County, Oregon]]]]\n\nMount Adams stands {{convert|37|mi|km}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]] and about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of [[Mount Rainier]]. It is {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of the [[Columbia River]] and {{convert|55|mi|km}} north of [[Mount Hood]] in [[Oregon]]. The nearest major cities are [[Yakima]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the northeast, and the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metropolitan area, {{convert|60|mi|km}} to the southwest. Between half and two thirds of Adams is within the [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] of the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]. The remaining area is within the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] of the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. While many of the volcanic peaks in Oregon are located on the Cascade Crest, Adams is the only active volcano in Washington to do so. It is farther east than all the rest of Washington's volcanoes except [[Glacier Peak]].<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\nAdams is one of the long-lived [[stratovolcano|volcano]]es in the [[Cascade Range]], with minor activity beginning 900,000 years ago and major cone building activity beginning 520,000 years ago. The whole mountain has been completely eroded by glaciers to an elevation of {{convert|8200|ft|m}} twice during its lifetime. The  current cone was built during the most recent major eruptive period 40,000\u201310,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Simcoes/>\n\nStanding at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, Adams towers about {{convert|9800|ft|m}} over the surrounding countryside. It is the second-highest mountain in Washington and third-highest in the [[Cascade Range]]. Because of the way it developed, it is the largest stratovolcano in Washington and second-largest in the Cascades, behind only [[Mount Shasta]]. Its large size is reflected in its {{convert|18|mi|km}}-diameter base, which has a prominent north-south trending axis.<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\n[[File:Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness 03.JPG|thumbnail|left|Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness]]\nAdams is the source of the headwaters for two major rivers, the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] and [[White Salmon River]]. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs at its base flow into two more major river systems, the [[Cispus River]] and the [[Klickitat River]]. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the [[Cowlitz River]] near [[Riffe Lake]], and the Lewis River.\n\nTo the south, the White Salmon River has its source on the lower flanks of the west side of Adams and gains additional flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, at some point in their courses, provide essential [[irrigation]] water for [[farming]] and [[ranching]]. The [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]] rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon)<ref name=Haring/> and [[Check dam|erosion control]] (Klickitat).<ref name=Keller/><ref name=KH_DEIS/> The [[Cispus River|Cispus]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis]] rivers have been [[Dam|impounded]] with dams farther downstream for [[flood control]] and [[hydroelectricity|power generation]] purposes.\n\nMount Adams is the second-most isolated, in terms of access, stratovolcano in Washington; [[Glacier Peak]] is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. [[U.S. Route 12|Highway 12]] passes about 25 miles to the north of Adams through the Cascades. [[Washington State Route 141|Highway 141]] comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the [[Columbia River]] to the small town of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance.<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec/><ref name=AdamsRec/> Access to the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles.<ref name=YNRecArea/> Two small towns, [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.\n\nIts size and distance from major cities, and the tendency of some people to forget or ignore Mount Adams, has led some people to call this volcano \"The Forgotten Giant of Washington.\"<ref name=Harris/>{{rp|237}}\n\nOn a clear day from the summit, other visible volcanoes in the [[Cascade Range]] include [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]] to the north, [[Mount St. Helens]] to the west, all in Washington; and [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]], [[Mount Thielsen]], [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]], [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]], and [[Mount McLoughlin]], all to the south in [[Oregon]].<ref name=WTAClimbTR/><ref name=Lyman1/>\n\n===Summit area===\nContrary to legend, the flatness of Adams' current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano's peak. Instead it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit, Pikers Peak, rises {{convert|11657|ft|m|sigfig=4}} on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about {{convert|600|ft|m|sigfig=2}} higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava and [[scoria]] cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress descending from the false summit to an elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=1}}. This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late [[Pleistocene]]. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from the Adams and White Salmon glaciers. On the east side, The Castle is a low prominence at the top of Battlement Ridge. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Mount Adams Summit Panorama.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view from the relatively flat summit area of Mount Adams, with the center of the image looking due west towards Mount St. Helens. Six [[Cascade Volcanoes]] are visible (not including Adams itself). From left to right: [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]].}}\n\n===Flank terrain features===\nProminent ridges descend from the mountain on all sides. On the north side, the aptly named North Cleaver comes down from a point below the summit [[ice cap]] heading almost due north. The Northwest Ridge and West Ridge descend from the Pinnacle, to the northwest and west, respectively. Stagman Ridge descends west-southwest from a point about halfway up the west side and turns more southwest at about {{convert|6000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. South of Stagman Ridge lies Crofton Ridge. Crofton gradually becomes very broad as it descends southwesterly from the tree line. MacDonald Ridge, on the south side, starts at about tree line below the lower end of Suksdorf Ridge and descends in a southerly direction.\n\nThree prominent ridges descend from the east side of the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is farthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The farthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\nSeveral rock prominences exist on the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence near the bottom of Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\n===Glaciers===\n[[File:Mt. Adams Glaciers above Bird Creek Meadows.JPG|thumb|Heavily crevassed glaciers on the southeast side of the mountain]]\n[[File:USGS Glaciers of Mount Adams Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.45|Glaciers of Mount Adams]]\n\nIn the early 21st century, glaciers cover a total of 2.5% of Adams' surface. During the last [[ice age]] about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Mount Adams has 209 perennial snow and ice features and 12 officially named glaciers. The total ice-covered area makes up {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2}}, while the area of named glaciers is {{convert|7.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/>  Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Klickitat Glacier|Klickitat]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]]) originate from Adams' summit ice cap.<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Reid1/>\n\nOn the northwest face of the mountain, [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] cascades down a steep channel in a series of [[icefall]]s before spreading out and terminating at around the {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} elevation, where it becomes the source of the Lewis River and Adams Creek, a tributary of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=Guardians/> Its eastern lobe ends at a small glacial [[tarn (lake)|tarn]], Equestria Lake. In the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], Adams Glacier is second in size only to [[Carbon Glacier]] on [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Wood\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\n[[File:Upper Portion of the Adams Glacier.JPG|thumb|Deep crevasses and icefalls on Adams Glacier]]\n\nThe [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[White Salmon Glacier (Mount Adams)|White Salmon]], and [[Avalanche Glacier|Avalanche]] glaciers on the west side of the mountain are less thick and voluminous, and are generally patchy in appearance. They all originate from [[cirques|glacial cirques]] below the actual summit. Although the White Salmon Glacier does not originate from the summit [[ice cap]], it does begin very high on the mountain at about {{convert|11600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. In the early 1900s, a portion of it descended from the summit ice cap,<ref name=Reid1/> but volume loss has separated it. Some of its glacial ice feeds the Avalanche Glacier below it to the southwest while the rest tumbles over some large cliffs to its diminutive lower section to the west. The White Salmon and Avalanche Glaciers feed the many streams of the Salt Creek and Cascade Creek drainages, which flow into the [[White Salmon River]]. The Pinnacle Glacier is the source of a fork of the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] as well as Riley Creek, which is also a tributary of the Lewis River.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe south side of the mountain along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small [[Gotchen Glacier]] and the [[Crescent Glacier (Mount Adams)|Crescent Glacier]]. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the [[White Salmon River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe rugged east side has four glaciers, the [[Mazama Glacier (Mount Adams)|Mazama Glacier]], [[Klickitat Glacier]], [[Rusk Glacier]], and the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]]. During the last [[Ice Age]], they carved out two immense canyons: the Hellroaring Canyon and the Avalanche Valley. This created the Ridge of Wonders between the two. Of the four glaciers on the east side, the Mazama Glacier is the farthest south and begins between the Suksdorf Ridge and Ridge of Wonders at about {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Near its terminus, it straddles the Ridge of Wonders and a small portion feeds into the Klickitat Glacier. The glacier gains more area from additional glacier ice that collects from drifting snow and avalanches below the Suksdorf Ridge as the ridge turns south. The Mazama Glacier terminates at about {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and is the source of Hellroaring Creek, which flows over several waterfalls before it joins Big Muddy Creek. [[Klickitat Glacier]] on the volcano's eastern flank originates in a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} wide [[cirque]] and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around {{convert|6600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, where it becomes the source of Big Muddy Creek, a tributary of the [[Klickitat River]]. The Rusk Glacier does not start from the summit ice cap, but starts at {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice from the summit cap. It is enclosed on the south by Battlement Ridge and Victory Ridge on the north and terminates at about {{convert|7100|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is the source of Rusk Creek, which flows over two waterfalls before joining the Big Muddy on its way to the Klickitat. The Wilson Glacier, like the Rusk Glacier, starts below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice; however, the Wilson Glacier starts slightly higher at about {{convert|10800|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is also fed by an arm of the Lyman Glacier as it flows down from the summit ice cap. The Wilson Glacier terminates at {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} where it is the source of Little Muddy Creek, another tributary of the Klickitat.<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe north side is distinguished by two major glaciers, the [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]] and [[Lava Glacier|Lava]] Glaciers. Like the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]], the Lyman Glacier is characterized by deep [[crevasse]]s and many [[icefall]]s as it cascades down from the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Guardians/> It is divided into two arms by a very rugged ridge at {{convert|10200|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and terminates at {{convert|7400|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The [[Lava Glacier]] originates in a large cirque below the summit at about {{convert|10000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, sandwiched between the North Cleaver on the west and the Lava Ridge to the east. It terminates at about {{convert|7600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The Lava and Lyman Glaciers are the source of the Muddy Fork of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe total glacier area on Mount Adams decreased 49%, from {{convert|31.5|km2|order=flip}} to {{convert|16.2|km2|order=flip}}, between 1904 and 2006, with the greatest loss occurring before 1949. Since 1949, the total glacier area has been relatively stable with a small amount of decline since the 1990s.<ref name=Treser/><ref name=\"Sitts\"/>\n\n===Surrounding area===\n[[File:Mt. Adams from the south.JPG|left|thumb|Aerial view of the south face from across the [[Columbia River Gorge]]]]\nMount Adams is surrounded by a variety of other volcanic features and [[volcano]]es. It stands near the center of a north-south trending volcanic field that is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|30|mi|km}} long, from just south of the [[Goat Rocks]] to Guler Mountain, the vent farthest south in the field. This field includes over 120 vents; about 25 of these are considered flank volcanoes of Mount Adams. The largest flank volcano is a [[basalt]]ic [[shield volcano]] on Adams east base called Goat Butte. This structure is at least 150,000&nbsp;years old.\nLittle Mount Adams is a symmetrical [[cinder cone]] on top of the Ridge of Wonders on Adams' southeast flank.<ref name=AdamsNatHistory/>\n\nPotato Hill is a cinder cone on Adams' north side that was created in the late [[Pleistocene]] and stands {{convert|800|ft|m|sigfig=2}} above its lava plain.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\nLavas from its base flowed into the Cispus Valley where they were later modified by glaciers.  At the {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} level on Adams' south flank is South Butte. The lavas associated with this structure are all younger than Suksdorf Ridge but were emplaced before the end of the last ice age.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\n[[File:Simulating Trout Lake, Klickitat County, Washington.jpg|thumbnail|right|Trout Lake (Trout Lake Creek) reflecting Mount Adams near the small town of Trout Lake]]\n\nSeveral relatively young obvious lava flows exist in the area around Adams. Most of these flows are on the north side of the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe many other vents and volcanoes encompassed by the Mount Adams field include Glaciate Butte and Red Butte on the north, King Mountain, Meadow Butte, Quigley Butte, and Smith Butte on the south, with others interspersed throughout.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nLocated a few miles north of Adams is [[Goat Rocks Wilderness]] and the heavily eroded ruins of a [[stratovolcano]] that is much older than Adams. Unlike Adams, the [[Goat Rocks]] volcano was periodically explosive and deposited [[volcanic ash|ash]] 2.5&nbsp;million years ago that later solidified into {{convert|2100|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=2}} thick [[tuff]] layers.<ref name=CascadesVolcanosObservatory/>\n\nIn the area surrounding Mount Adams, many caves have formed around inactive lava vents.<ref name=Lyman1/>  These caves are usually close to the surface and can be hundreds of feet deep and wide.<ref name=NYTCaves/> A few of the more well known caves include the [[Cheese Cave]], Ice Cave, and Deadhorse Caves. Cheese Cave has the largest bore of the caves near Adams with a diameter of {{convert|40|-|50|ft|m}} and a length of over {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.<ref name=Caldwell1953/> Ice cave, which is made up of several sections created by several [[sinkhole]]s, has an ice section that is {{convert|120|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|-|30|ft|m}} in diameter and noted for its ice formations.<ref name=Lyman2/><ref name=AdamsOuting1913/> From the same entrance, the tube continues another {{convert|500|ft|m}} to the west.<ref name=IceCaveWA/><ref name=CavesOfWA/> Deadhorse Cave is a massive network of lava tubes. It the most complex [[lava tube]] in the United States with {{convert|14441|ft|m}} of passage.<ref name=OregonGrotto/> These caves are all just outside of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. These and many other caves in the Trout Lake area were at one time part of a huge system that originated at the [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]]. The most obscure caves around Adams are the Windholes on the southeast side near Island Cabin Campground.<ref name=windholes/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Takh Takh Lava Flow.png|thumb|Takh Takh Lava Flow below Mount Adams]]\nAdams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} diameter base which is elongated in its north-south axis and covers an area of {{convert|250|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The volcano has a volume of {{convert|70|cumi|km3|sigfig=2}} placing it second only to [[Mount Shasta]] in that category among the [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] stratovolcanoes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>  Mount Adams was created by the subduction of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]], which is located just off the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Harris/>\n\nMount Adams was born in the mid to late [[Pleistocene]] and grew in several pulses of mostly [[lava]]-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy and minor activity, during which, [[glacier]]s eroded the mountain to below {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. [[Potassium-argon dating]] has identified three such eruptive periods; the first occurring 520,000&nbsp;to 500,000 years ago, the second 450,000&nbsp;years ago, and the third 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/> Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the [[volcano]], consist of [[lava flows]] with little [[tephra]]. The loose material that makes up much of Adams' core is made of [[breccia]]ted lava.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[Andesite]] and [[basalt]] flows formed a {{convert|20|to|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|adj=on}} thick circle around the base of the Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with handful of [[dacite]] and [[pyroclastic flow]]s which erupted early in Adams' development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last [[ice age]]. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily [[erosion|eroded]] [[andesite]] fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into [[clay]]s (mostly [[kaolinite]]), [[iron oxide]]s, [[sulfur]]-rich compounds and [[quartz]].<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\nThe present eruptive cone above {{convert|7000|ft|m}} was constructed sometime between 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least ten times, generally from above {{convert|6500|ft|m}}. One of the more recent flows issued from South Butte and created the {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500-year-old [[Mount St. Helens]] ash on it, meaning it is at least that old.<ref name=\"Wright\"/> Of a similar age are the Takh Takh Meadows and Muddy Fork lava flows. The lowest vent to erupt since the main cone was constructed is Smith Butte on the south slope of Adams. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams is an approximately 1000-year-old flow that emerged from a vent at about {{convert|8200|ft|m}} on Battlement Ridge.<ref name=Harris/>\n[[File:Mount Adams Volcano Hazard Zones.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Mount Adams, Washington simplified hazards map showing potential impact area for ground-based hazards during a volcanic event.]]\n\nThe Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large [[debris flow]] from Adams and the only large one since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} of the [[White Salmon River]] valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest [[avalanche]] on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} and its debris covered about {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|1}} of the upper Salt Creek area.<ref name=Slide/> Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/> This was the only debris flow in Mount Adams' recorded history, but there are five known lahars.<ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\nSince then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including [[hydrogen sulfide]]) have occurred especially on the summit plateau and indicate that Adams is [[Volcano#Dormant|dormant]], not [[Volcano#Extinct|extinct]]. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of [[andesite]] or [[basalt]]. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams tend to have a low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens and some of the other Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large [[landslide]]s and other debris flows.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams rock and ice debris avalanche.jpg|thumb|Rock and ice debris avalanche that occurred on October 20, 1997 on the east side of Mount Adams.]]\nIn 1997, Adams experienced two slides seven weeks apart that were the largest slides in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], ignoring the catastrophic [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens]], since a slide that occurred on [[Little Tahoma]] in 1963.<ref name=avalanche/> The first occurred at the end of August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle.

According to the [[Bridge of the Gods (geologic event)|Bridge of the Gods]] tale, Wy'east ([[Mount Hood]]) and Pahto (Mount Adams; also called Paddo or Klickitat by native peoples) were the sons of the [[Great Spirit]]. The brothers both competed for the love of the beautiful La-wa-la-clough ([[Mount St. Helens]]). When La-wa-la-clough chose Pahto, Wy'east struck his brother hard so that Pahto's head was flattened and Wy'east took La-wa-la-clough from him (thus attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance).<ref name=Harris/> Other versions of the story state that losing La-wa-la-clough caused Pahto such grief that he dropped his head in shame.<ref name=Scott1997/><ref name=CVO_Volcano_Names/><ref name=Hill/>\n\nIn a legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitats]], the chief of the gods, Tyhee Saghalie, came to [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] with his two sons. The sons quarreled about who would settle where. To settle the dispute, Saghalie shot an arrow to the west and to the north and told his sons to find them and to settle where the arrows had fallen. So one settled in the [[Willamette Valley]] and the other in the area between the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River]]s and they became the ancestors of the [[Multnomah people|Multnomah]] and [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] tribes respectively. To separate the tribes, Saghalie raised the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]]. He also created the \"[[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]]\" as a way for the tribes to meet with one another easily. A \"witch-woman,\" whose name was Loowit, lived on the bridge and had control of the only fire in the world. She wanted to give the tribes fire to improve their condition and Saghalie consented. He was so pleased with Loowit's faithfulness that he offered Loowit whatever she wanted. She asked for youth and beauty and Saghalie granted her wish. Suitors came from near and far until finally she could not decide between Klickitat and Wiyeast. Klickitat and Wiyeast went to war over the matter until finally Sahalie decided to punish them for creating such chaos. He broke the Bridge of the Gods and put the three lovers to death. However, in order to honor their beauty, he raised up three mountains: Wiyeast (Hood), Klickitat (Adams), and Loowit (St. Helens).<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Lyman4/><ref name=Lyman5/><ref name=Lyman6/><ref name=ORNativeSon/>\n\nIn a similar legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitats]], there was a large inland sea between the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at [[Mount Multnomah]], one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled disputes among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), sons of the [[Great Spirit]] Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda's calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the [[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]] was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was in another part of the world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as [[Mount St. Helens]]. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.<ref name=Sterrett/>\n\n[[File:Thunderbird on Totem Pole.jpg|thumb|upright|Thunderbird on a Totem Pole]]\nThe [[Yakama]]s also have a legend attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the [[Goat Rocks]]), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now the first to be greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee ([[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]]) convinced Wyeast ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken with the rest of the mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The [[Great Spirit]] had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.<ref name=WAHistoryOnline/>\n\nIn many of the legends of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], there are [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s that live on them and Adams is no exception. This particular thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized the inhabitants of the land. Speelyi, the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.<ref name=Lyman4/>\n\nSeveral other tribes have legends involving battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz]] and [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]] have a legend where [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]] and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]] were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, St. Helens was the man and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the [[Yakama]]s has a terrific battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), Low-we-lat-Klah (St. Helens), and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.<ref name=Clark/>\n\n===Exploration===\nAdams was known to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal languages ([[Plateau Penutian languages|Plateau Penutian]], [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]]), Pahto means ''high up'', ''very high'', ''standing up'', or ''high sloping mountain''.<ref name=ORNativeSonML/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/> The [[Klickitat people#Name|Klickitat name]] is of [[Sahaptin language#Dialects|Klickitat]] origin and comes from the [[Chinookan]] for ''beyond''.\n\nIn 1805, on the journey westward down the [[Columbia River|Columbia]], the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] recorded seeing the mountain; noting that it was \"a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow\"<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> and thought it \"perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.\"<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> They initially misidentified it as [[Mount St. Helens]], which had been previously discovered and named by [[George Vancouver]]. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it \"a very high humped mountain\".<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/>\n\nFor several decades after Lewis and Clark sighted the mountain, people continued to get Adams confused with [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]], due in part to their somewhat similar appearance and similar [[latitude]]. In the 1830s, [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the [[Cascade Range]] as the President's Range and rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. [[Mount Hood]], in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President [[John Adams]] and St. Helens was to be renamed after [[George Washington]]. In a mistake or deliberate change by mapmaker and proponent of the Kelley plan, [[Thomas J. Farnham]], the names for Hood and St. Helens were interchanged. And, likely because of the confusion about which mountain was St. Helens, he placed the ''Mount Adams'' name north of Mount Hood and about {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of Mount St. Helens. By what would seem sheer coincidence, there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed.<ref name=CVO_Adams/> However, it was not official until 1853, when the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], under the direction of [[Washington Territory]] governor [[Isaac I. Stevens]], determined its location, described the surrounding countryside, and placed the name on the map.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Beckey/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/>\n\nSince its discovery by explorers, the height of Adams has also been subject to revision. The topographer for the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], Lt. [[Johnson K. Duncan]], and [[George Gibbs (ethnologist)|George Gibbs]], ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought it was about the same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation.<ref name=Beckey/> The [[Canada\u2013United States border#The Northwest Boundary Survey (1857\u201361)|Northwest Boundary Survey]] listed Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|9570|ft|m}}<ref name=Beckey/>  while a later [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] gave it an elevation of {{convert|11906|ft|m}}.<ref name=HistorianReport/> The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the [[Mazamas|Mazamas mountaineering club]], William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and [[William Gladstone Steel]]. Using a [[Hypsometer#Pressure hypsometer|boiling point thermometer]], [[Barometer#Mercury barometers|mercurial barometer]], and an [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]], they determined the elevation to be {{convert|12255|,|12402|, and|12150|ft|m}} respectively.<ref name=Elevation/> None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the [[US Geological Survey]] (USGS), using a [[triangulation]] method, also measured the height of several mountains in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and they measured Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|12470|ft|m}}.<ref name=NatGeo/> The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to {{convert|12307|ft|m}} and again in 1970 to {{convert|12276|ft|m}} for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, is generated by the new method, [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]], for calculating altitudes.\n\n[[Claude Ewing Rusk]], a local settler and [[mountaineer]], was one of those most familiar with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle [[glacier]]s. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman<ref name=Rusk/> and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone.<ref name=Beckey/> While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.<ref name=Rusk/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams (Washington) Map 1901 Reid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Reid's map from his survey of Adams in 1901]]\nNo detailed descriptions of Adams or its [[glacier]]s existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams to be the source of some of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia River basalt flows]]. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous [[caldera]] that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the [[anticline]] ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley.<ref name=Lyman2/> Modern [[geology]] has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the [[Mazamas]] in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896.<ref name=Lyman7/> Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted [[geologist]]/[[glaciologist]] [[Harry Fielding Reid]] to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant [[glacier]]s, [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Lava Glacier|Lava]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[Rusk Glacier|Rusk]] with suggestions from Rusk.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Beckey/> He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte.<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Reid2/> Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the [[Little Ice Age]].<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Reid2/> The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nOn the 1895 [[Mazamas]] expedition, the first [[heliograph]]y between several of the peaks of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] was attempted with some success. A party on [[Mount Hood]] was able to communicate back and forth with the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], [[Mount Baker|Baker]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Jefferson]], and [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]] were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and logistical problems.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=HistorianReport/><ref name=Wells/>\n\n[[File:Cascadians Climbing Party east side Mount Adams (Washington).jpg|thumb|left|Cascadians climbing party before starting the ascent of the east side of Adams]]\nThe first ascent of Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken,<ref name=AikenName/> [[Edward Jay Allen]], and Andrew J. Burge.<ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/><ref name=Hazard/> While most sources list the aforementioned names, at least one substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge.<ref name=Guardians/> Their route was likely up the North Cleaver because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through [[Naches Pass]], which is to the north of Adams.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nWhile the north and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the mountain were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and [[icefall|ice cascades]].<ref name=Guardians/> To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, [[C. E. Rusk]] searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]], Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily [[crevasse]]d eastern side of the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Rusk/> One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was \"thrilling to the point of extreme danger.\"<ref name=Hazard/> Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Coursen/> Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the [[Mazamas]] finally climbed the west face of Adams.<ref name=WestAscent/> This route is straightforward, but made difficult by [[icefall]]s, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.<ref name=Hazard/>\n\nSome of the caves around Adams were subject to commercial ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] in years of short supply elsewhere.<ref name=CondonCaves/> Oddly, a \"claim\" to the cave using mining laws was used in order to gain exclusive access to the ice.<ref name=IceCaveWA/> [[Cheese Cave]] was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, for a number of years in the 1950s, a [[bleu cheese]] similar to the [[Roquefort]] produced in [[Roquefort-sur-Soulzon]], France.<ref name=Caldwell1953/><ref name=Cheese/><ref name=Halliday/> A legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]]s regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the \"mouse-wife,\" they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man's wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the \"mouse-wife\" to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nAdams was the feature of a 1915 documentary \"When the Mountains Call.\" This film documented the journey from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to the summit and showed many of the sights along the way.<ref name=Movie/>\n\n===Forest Service operations===\n[[File:Gotchen Creek Guard Station.jpg|thumb|left|Gotchen Creek Guard Station ca. 1911]]\nAdams and the lands surrounding it were initially set aside as part of the [[Mount Rainier Forest Reserve]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], was created under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the [[Rainier National Forest]] was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the [[Columbia National Forest]]. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, [[Gifford Pinchot]]. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.<ref name=GPNF_History/>\n\nAdams is home to the oldest building on the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]], the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area.<ref name=EarToTheGround/> In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large [[wildfire]], the [[Cold Springs Fire]], although fire crews were able to stop the fire before it got too close. Wildfires in 2012 ([[Cascade Creek Fire]]) and 2015 ([[Cougar Creek Fire]]) also required this precaution, and fire crews were able to stop them as well.<ref name=mailonline/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams Lookout.jpg|thumb|right|US Forest Service lookout on the summit, August 9, 1922.]]\nIn 1916, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] began preparations to establish the highest [[Fire lookout tower|fire lookout]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] at the top of Adams. This was part of an endeavor that began in 1915 on [[Mount Hood]]<ref name=HoodLO/> and 1916 on [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]<ref name=StHelensLO/> The idea was to situate lookouts far above all low-lying hills and mountains to give the lookouts an immense area for observation without obstructions. Being at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, the new lookout would also be the third highest in the world and still is.<ref name=showtell/> In 1917, building materials were moved to the base of the mountain and in 1918, Dan Lewis packed the building materials and lumber to the lower portion of Suksdorf Ridge.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The following summer was spent hauling the building materials to the top.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The four men assigned the job, Arthur \"Art\" Jones, Adolph Schmid, Julius Wang, and Jessie Robbins, had a difficult task ahead of them until they engineered a way to quickly and, for the most part, safely bring the building materials up the slope using a deadman/rope technique.<ref name=MtnMen/> Construction of the standard D-6 building with a \u00bc second story cupola<ref name=Abegg/> began in the summer of 1920 and was completed a year later by Art, Adolph, James Huffman and Joe Guler.<ref name=Rusk/> It was manned as a lookout during the last year of its construction through 1924. After which it was abandoned because of the difficulties of operating a [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] that high and because lower level clouds, smoke, and haze frequently and effectively blocked the view of the lower elevations. Arthur Jones was likely the one person most involved in the project, spending five seasons on the mountain. Others who worked on the project or staffed the lookout include Rudolph Deitrich, the last [[fire lookout|lookout]], and Chaffin \"Chafe\" Johnson.<ref name=MtnMen/>\n\nAfter the [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] at the summit was abandoned, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] changed strategies from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as [[airplane]]s became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate.<ref name=WashingtonLO/><ref name=SWWALO/> One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer<ref name=BurleyMtn/> and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending.<ref name=Abegg/><ref name=ORLive/> Two lookouts remain nearby on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high [[National Fire Danger Rating System|fire danger]].<ref name=Abegg/>\n\n===Sulfur mine===\nIn 1929, Wade Dean formed the Glacier Mining Company and filed [[mining claim]]s to the [[sulfur]] on Adams' {{convert|210|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first assessment work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to {{convert|210|ft|m}} thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, it could not be carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made over the course of the mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] [[fire lookout tower|lookout]], a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed {{convert|8|by|12|ft|m}} [[lean-to]] was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above {{convert|12000|ft|m}} could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of {{convert|110|F|C}} recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of {{convert|-48|F|C}}. This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit [[ice cap]]. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean's desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959.<ref name=MtnMen/>  Adams is the only large [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Level IV ecoregions, Cascades.png|thumb|upright|Level IV ecoregions, Cascades]]\nBecause of its remote location and relative inaccessibility, [[Climate Data Records|climate records]] are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, has only been measuring [[precipitation]] since 1982 and [[temperature]]s since 1989.<ref name=PHWeather/> [[Temperature record|Temperature]] and precipitation records from [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], both considerably lower in [[elevation]] and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood<ref name=AdamsCOOP/> and 1924 at Trout Lake.<ref name=NWS/> [[Snow]]fall records from the three [[Snow hydrology#Equipment and Testing|snow station]]s on Adams cover a number of years but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950\u20131976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report snow depth.<ref name=PHWeather/> The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956\u20131978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962\u20131978. Divide Meadow was the most representative of the snow depth on the west side of Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\nLike the rest of the high [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] mountains, Adams receives a large amount of snow, but because it lies farther east than many of its [[Washington (state)|Washington]] compatriots, it receives less than one might expect for a mountain of its height. Although snowfall is not measured directly, it can be estimated from the [[Snow#Snowfall measurement|snow depth]]; and since the Potato Hill station was upgraded to report daily snow depth in 2006, there has been an average of {{convert|210|in|cm}} of snow every year. Also since 2006, the most snow to fall in a day was {{convert|28|in|cm}} (Feb 26, 2011), in a month, {{convert|92|in|cm}} (Dec 2007), and in a year, {{convert|288|in|cm}} (2012).<ref name=PHWeather/>\n\n[[File:Lenticular clouds over Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|Towering [[lenticular cloud]]s over Mount Adams]]\nBy April, there is, on average, {{convert|89|in|cm}} of snow on the ground at Potato Hill.<ref name=PHWeather/> The average monthly snow depth at Potato Hill has not changed much from the records collected from 1950\u20131976 with only a small decrease in January, February, and May and a small increase in March and April.

These two stations average a greater amount of snow than Potato Hill, with an average of {{convert|102|in|cm}} at Council Pass and {{convert|141|in|cm}} at Divide Meadow by April. Divide Meadow generally receives the most snow with a record depth of {{convert|222|in|cm}} in 1972. The [[snowpack]] at Potato Hill starts building in late October to early November and the last of the snow generally melts by the beginning of June, but occasionally lingers into July.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\n[[Temperature]]s and [[precipitation]] can be highly variable around Adams, due in part to its geographic location astride the Cascade Crest, which gives it more of a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental.2Fmicrothermal climates|continental]] influence than some of its neighbors.

[[climate]] of Adams gives it a large amount of diversity within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, [[Abies grandis|grand fir]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|Douglas fir]] dominate the forest with [[Tsuga heterophylla|Western hemlock]] and [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] are dominant with some patches of dense [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]] and [[Abies procera|noble fir]]; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases, the forest changes again with [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]], [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]], and [[Tsuga mertensiana|mountain hemlock]] becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine]] and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are [[Pinus monticola|Western white pine]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]], [[Larix occidentalis|Western larch]], [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]], [[Cupressus nootkatensis|Alaska cedar]], and [[Juniperus communis|mountain juniper]]. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species [[Acer macrophyllum|big leaf maple]], [[Quercus garryana|Oregon white oak]], [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]], [[Populus trichocarpa|black cottonwood]], and [[Alnus rubra|red alder]]. Large shrubs/small trees include the [[Betula glandulosa|dwarf birch]], [[Crataegus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's hawthorn]], [[Corylus cornuta|California hazelnut]], [[Prunus emarginata|bitter cherry]], [[Acer circinatum|vine maple]], [[Acer glabrum|Douglas maple]], and [[Sambucus cerulea|blue elderberry]] and contribute to a vibrant fall display.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=flora2/>\n\n[[Big Tree (Washington)|Big Tree]], (also known as Trout Lake Big Tree), is a massive [[Ponderosa pine|ponderosa]] pine tree in majestic, [[old growth]] pine and fir forests at the southern base of Mount Adams.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> The tree rises to a lofty {{convert|202|ft|m}}<ref name=\"richard1\"/>  with a diameter of {{convert|7|ft|m}},<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/> and is one of the largest known ponderosa pine trees in the world.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> As of 2015, however, the tree has been stressed by attacks from [[Bark beetle|pine beetle]]s.<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/>\n\nThe large diversity of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the [[Herbaceous plant|herbage]] and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is more than any other mountain in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by [[Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf|William Suksdorf]] and [[Thomas J. Howell (botanist)|Thomas Howell]] and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts.<ref name=flora/> This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed.<ref name=flora2/> Adams is home to many rare plants including [[Actaea elata|tall bugbane]], [[Mimulus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's monkeyflower]], northern microseris (''[[Microceris borealis]]''), Brewer's potentilla (''[[Potentilla breweri]]''), and [[Sisyrinchium sarmentosum|mountain blue-eyed grass]].<ref name=flora2/> The plant diversity is most evident in the many [[meadow]]s and [[wetland]]s on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, [[Castilleja parviflora|magenta paintbrush]], [[Senecio triangularis|arrowleaf ragwort]], [[penstemon]]s, [[Lupinus|lupine]]s, [[Mimulus|monkeyflower]]s, [[Phyllodoce (plant)|mountain heather]]s, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find [[Vaccinium uliginosum|bog blueberry]], [[Viburnum edule|highbush cranberry]], [[Drosera anglica|sundew]], [[Comarum palustre|purple cinquefoil]], and [[Utricularia intermedia|flatleaf bladderwort]], in addition to many [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[Juncaceae|rush]]es. [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|Subalpine]] and [[Montane ecology#Alpine grasslands and tundra|alpine]] meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a display as well with [[Luetkea|partrigefoot]], Cascade [[Boechera|rockcress]], [[subalpine buttercup]], [[Valeriana sitchensis|Sitka valerian]], [[Smelowskia ovalis|alpine false candytuft]], [[Polemonium elegans|elegant Jacob's ladder]], and various [[Polygonaceae|buckwheat]]s as prominent players.<ref name=Friends/>\n\n===Fauna===\n[[File:Hoary marmot Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|[[Hoary marmot]] above the tree line on Adams]]\nAdams is home to a fairly wide variety of animal species. Several [[hoofed mammals]] call the mountain home: [[mountain goat]]s, [[Roosevelt elk]], [[black-tailed deer]], and [[mule deer]]. Large carnivores include [[cougar]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[coyote]], [[bobcat]], and the [[Red fox#Subspecies|Cascade mountain fox]],<ref name=CCP/> an endemic subspecies of the [[red fox]]. There have also been sightings of [[wolverine]]<ref name=CCP/><ref name=Wolverine_Oregonian /> and unconfirmed reports of [[Gray wolf|wolves]].<ref name=WDFWWolf/> Many small mammals also make Adams their home. [[Squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s are numerous throughout the forest. [[Douglas squirrel]]s, [[least chipmunk]]s, and [[Townsend's chipmunk]]s live throughout the forest with [[golden-mantled ground squirrel]]s and [[California ground squirrel]]s occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive [[pine marten]]s that also call Adams their home. [[Hoary marmot]]s and [[pika]]s make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive [[snowshoe hare]] lives throughout the forest.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=CCP/><ref name=Lyman3/><ref name=animals/>\n\nThe profusion of wildflowers attracts a large number of [[pollinator]]s including [[butterflies]] such as [[Parnassius|Apollos]], ''[[Melitaea]]'', ''[[Coenonympha]]'', [[Neophasia menapia|snowflakes]], [[Painted lady|painted ladies]], [[Pieris (butterfly)|garden whites]], [[Papilio|swallowtails]], [[Skipper (butterfly)|skippers]], [[Limenitis|admirals]], [[Coliadinae|sulphurs]], [[Lycaenidae|blues]], and [[List of fritillaries (butterflies)|fritillaries]].<ref name=animals/><ref name=Butterflies/>\n\n[[File:Gray-crowned rosy finch Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|[[Grey-crowned rosy finch|Gray-crowned rosy finch]] high up the slopes on Adams]]\nMany birds call Adams home or a stopover on their migration routes. Songbirds include three species of [[chickadee]], two [[kinglet]]s, several [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]]es, [[warbler]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, and [[finch]]es. One unique [[songbird]] to the high elevations is the [[grey-crowned rosy finch|gray-crowned rosy finch]], who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. [[Raptor (bird)|Raptors]] that live in the forest and meadows include ''[[Accipiter]]''s, [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[golden eagle|golden]] and [[bald eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[great horned owl]]s, and [[falcon]]s. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the [[hairy woodpecker]], [[downy woodpecker]], and [[white-headed woodpecker]]. Jays such as the [[Steller's jay]] and [[Canada jay]] are common and the Canada jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the [[Clark's nutcracker]] with its distinctive call. [[Swallow]]s and [[swift]]s are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. [[Common merganser]]s and several other species of [[water bird]]s can be found on many of the lakes as well. The [[American dipper]] with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several [[grouse]] species, the [[sooty grouse|sooty]], [[spruce grouse|spruce]], and [[ruffed grouse]] and the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=animals/><ref name=MountaineerBirds/>\n\nThe streams and lakes around Adams offer a number of [[fish]] for the [[Angling|angler]] to seek out. The two most common species, [[eastern brook trout]] and [[rainbow trout]] ([[Columbia River redband trout]]), are in nearly every lake and stream. [[Brown trout]] and [[cutthroat trout]] appear in most of the lakes in the [[Midway High Lakes Area|High Lakes Area]] and three lakes are home to [[tiger trout]]. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of [[trout]].<ref name=WDFWFish/> [[Bull trout]] can be found in the upper reaches of the [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]]s.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> [[Westslope cutthroat trout]] can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the [[Cispus River]]. [[mountain whitefish|Whitefish]] can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and [[Cowlitz River]]s, falls on the [[White Salmon River]]), the only river where [[anadromous fish]]es can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. [[Chinook salmon]], [[coho salmon]], and [[steelhead]], in several different [[Salmon run|run]]s, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.<ref name=YKFP/>\n\nThe [[Conboy Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] lies at the base of Mount Adams. The refuge covers {{convert|6500|acres|ha}} and contains conifer forests, grasslands, and shallow wetlands. Protected wildlife includes [[deer]], [[elk]], [[beaver]], [[coyote]], [[otter]], small [[rodent]]s, [[bald eagle]], greater [[sandhill crane]], and the [[Oregon spotted frog]].<ref name=USFWS_CLNWR/> It and the lands nearby are home to several rare and threatened species of plants and animals including the previously mentioned Oregon spotted frog and greater sandhill crane, [[Astragalus pulsiferae|Suksdorf's milk vetch]], [[Orthocarpus bracteosus|rosy owl's-clover]], [[Eryngium|Oregon coyote thistle]], [[Polites mardon|Mardon skipper]], [[peregrine falcon]], and [[Western gray squirrel]].<ref name=FWSRare/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mountains|Volcanoes}}\n*[[List of mountain peaks of North America]]\n**[[List of mountain peaks of the United States]]\n***[[List of Ultras of the United States]]\n***[[List of volcanoes in the United States]]\n***[[List of highest points in Washington by county]]\n*[[Geology of the Pacific Northwest]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"ngs\">{{cite ngs |pid=SB1004 |name=Mount Adams |accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=peakbagger>{{cite peakbagger |pid=2365 |title=Mount Adams, Washington |accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=CAG>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.climbingwashington.com/features/wahighest.htm\n |title       = Washington's 100 highest Mountains\n |publisher   = Cascade Alpine Guide\n |accessdate  = 2008-12-21\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172523/http://www.climbingwashington.com/features/wahighest.htm\n |archivedate = 2008-05-11\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=AdamsRec>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31184\n| title = Mount Adams Area\n| work = Gifford Pinchot National Forest\n| publisher = [[United States Forest Service|USFS]]\n| date = 2015-11-24 | accessdate = 2016-02-17\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160204183043/http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31184\n| archivedate= 2016-02-04}}</ref>\n<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31180\n| title = Cowlitz Valley Area\n| work = Gifford Pinchot National Forest\n| publisher = [[United States Forest Service|USFS]]\n| date = 2015-10-24 | accessdate = 2016-02-17\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160113140220/http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31180\n| archivedate= 2016-01-13}}</ref>\n<ref name=BurleyMtn>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=31222\n| title = Trail #256 Burley Mountain\n| work = Gifford Pinchot National Forest\n| publisher = [[United States Forest Service|USFS]]\n| date = 2015-11-24 | accessdate = 2016-03-21}}</ref>\n<ref name=YNSite>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.yakamanation-nsn.gov/\n| title = Official Site of the Yakama Nation\n| accessdate = 2012-05-21 }}</ref>\n<ref name=USFSAdamsPCT>\n{{cite web\n| title = Pacific Northwest Region Viewing Area - Mt.
