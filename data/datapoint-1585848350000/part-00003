To this end, O'Hara must act as a substitute teacher in Cullen Jr's [[kindergarten]] class at Astoria Elementary School. O'Hara gets a terrible case of [[stomach flu]], falling ill at the last moment, so  Kimble takes her place. The suspicious school principal, Miss Schlowski, is convinced he will not last long before quitting. Though initially overwhelmed, he adapts to his new status quickly, despite not having any formal teaching experience. With the use of his pet [[ferret]] as a class mascot, positive reinforcement, his police training as a model for structure in class and his experience as a father, he becomes a much admired and cherished figure to the students.\n\nKimble begins to enjoy his undercover role. At one point, he deals with a case of [[child abuse]] by assaulting and threatening the father of the abused child, winning Miss Schlowski's favor. In observation of his teaching style, she assures him that even though she does not agree with his methods, she can see that he is a good teacher. Kimble also becomes fond of fellow teacher Joyce Palmieri, whose son Dominic is one of his students. She is estranged from her husband and will not speak of him, telling Dominic that he lives in [[France]]. Conversing with the gradually more trusting Joyce, Kimble deduces that she is Rachel and that Dominic is Cullen Jr. Back in California, the case holding Crisp in jail is closed after the witness dies from using tainted cocaine provided by Crisp's mother, Eleanor. He is subsequently released from prison, and quickly travels to Astoria with Eleanor to search for Cullen Jr.\n\nWhen Kimble learns Crisp has been released, he confronts Rachel about her identity, saying he can protect her if she cooperates. Outraged that he misled her, she tells him that Crisp lied about her stealing the money to convince drug dealers to help him find her; the real reason was to find Cullen Jr, as he was angry that Rachel disappeared with him (even though she had every reason to do this, given her ex-husband's infamy, and the bad example of a father he would be as a result). Crisp starts a fire in the library as a distraction to kidnap Cullen Jr, but uses him as a hostage when Kimble arrives. Kimble's ferret, who was hiding in Cullen Jr's shirt, bites Crisp in the neck, allowing Cullen Jr to escape; Crisp shoots Kimble in the leg before Kimble fatally shoots Crisp. Outside, Eleanor injures O'Hara with her car before going inside and discovering Crisp dead; she wounds Kimble in the shoulder, but O'Hara appears and vengefully knocks her unconscious with a baseball bat. Eleanor is then arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with O'Hara, with both of them making a full recovery. O'Hara returns to the police force in Los Angeles, while Kimble decides to retire, staying in Astoria to become a kindergarten teacher at the school full-time. Rachel joins him and the two share a kiss while everyone cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- top billed in closing credits order --->\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Detective John Kimble\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Joyce Palmieri/Rachel Myatt Crisp\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Detective Phoebe O'Hara\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Miss Schlowski\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Cullen Crisp\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Eleanor Crisp \n* [[Christian and Joseph Cousins]] as Dominic Palmieri/Cullen Crisp, Jr.\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Jillian  \n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Zach's mother\n* [[Park Overall]] as Samantha's mother\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Captain Salazar\n* [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] as Henry Shoop\n* Justin Page as Zach Sullivan\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emma\n* [[Adam Wylie]] as Larry\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Stewardess\n* Marissa Rosen as Samantha\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Joseph\n* [[Ben Diskin]] as Sylvester\n* Ben McCreary as Lowell \n* Krystle and Tiffany Mataras as Tina and Rina\n* Amber Reaves as Mary\n* [[Odette Annable|Odette Yustman]] as Rosa\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Bill Murray]] was approached to play the role of John Kimble.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|accessdate=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=20 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned more than 2,000 children for the roles of the students.<ref>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=King | title=Ivan Reitman, 'Kindergarten Cop's' Top Sergeant | work=The Los Angeles Times | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | accessdate=December 2, 2010 | date=December 21, 1990 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425210549/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | archivedate=25 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\nExterior scenes at Astoria Elementary School were filmed at John Jacob Astor Elementary School, located at 3550 Franklin Avenue in [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref name = \"Filming\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/locations |title=Filming locations for Kindergarten Cop |website=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Universal Studios]] hired local artists Judith Niland and Carl Lyle Jenkins to paint murals on the walls at Astoria, and provided new playground equipment, a fenced playground, and a new lawn and hedges around the school.

Outside, Eleanor injures O'Hara with her car before going inside and discovering Crisp dead; she wounds Kimble in the shoulder, but O'Hara appears and vengefully knocks her unconscious with a baseball bat. Eleanor is then arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with O'Hara, with both of them making a full recovery. O'Hara returns to the police force in Los Angeles, while Kimble decides to retire, staying in Astoria to become a kindergarten teacher at the school full-time. Rachel joins him and the two share a kiss while everyone cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- top billed in closing credits order --->\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Detective John Kimble\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Joyce Palmieri/Rachel Myatt Crisp\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Detective Phoebe O'Hara\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Miss Schlowski\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Cullen Crisp\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Eleanor Crisp \n* [[Christian and Joseph Cousins]] as Dominic Palmieri/Cullen Crisp, Jr.\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Jillian  \n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Zach's mother\n* [[Park Overall]] as Samantha's mother\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Captain Salazar\n* [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] as Henry Shoop\n* Justin Page as Zach Sullivan\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emma\n* [[Adam Wylie]] as Larry\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Stewardess\n* Marissa Rosen as Samantha\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Joseph\n* [[Ben Diskin]] as Sylvester\n* Ben McCreary as Lowell \n* Krystle and Tiffany Mataras as Tina and Rina\n* Amber Reaves as Mary\n* [[Odette Annable|Odette Yustman]] as Rosa\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Bill Murray]] was approached to play the role of John Kimble.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|accessdate=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=20 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned more than 2,000 children for the roles of the students.<ref>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=King | title=Ivan Reitman, 'Kindergarten Cop's' Top Sergeant | work=The Los Angeles Times | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | accessdate=December 2, 2010 | date=December 21, 1990 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425210549/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | archivedate=25 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\nExterior scenes at Astoria Elementary School were filmed at John Jacob Astor Elementary School, located at 3550 Franklin Avenue in [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref name = \"Filming\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/locations |title=Filming locations for Kindergarten Cop |website=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Universal Studios]] hired local artists Judith Niland and Carl Lyle Jenkins to paint murals on the walls at Astoria, and provided new playground equipment, a fenced playground, and a new lawn and hedges around the school.
