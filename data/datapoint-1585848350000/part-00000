Caricatures of far-left leaders from the Russian Empire in [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]'']]\n[[Walter Laqueur]] traces the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory to Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]], for whom Bolshevism was \"the revolt of the Jewish, Slavic and [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] against the German ([[Aryan]]) element in Russia\". Germans, according to Rosenberg, had been responsible for Russia's historic achievements and had been sidelined by the Bolsheviks, who did not represent the interests of the Russian people, but instead those of its ethnic Jewish and Chinese population.{{sfn|Laqueur|1990|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nMichael Kellogg, in his Ph.D. thesis, argues that the racist ideology of Nazis was to a significant extent influenced by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9]]s in Germany, many of whom, while being former subjects of the Russian Empire, were of non-Russian descent: [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|ethnic Germans]], residents of Baltic lands including [[Baltic Germans]], and [[Ukrainians]]. Of particular role was their ''Aufbau'' organization (Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung f\u00fcr den Osten (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organization for the East)). For example, its leader was instrumental in making ''The Protocols of The Elders of Zion'' available in German language. He argues that early Hitler was rather [[philosemitic]], and became rabidly antisemitic since 1919 under the influence of the White \u00e9migr\u00e9 convictions about the conspiracy of the Jews, an unseen unity from financial capitalists to Bolsheviks, to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Kellogg |title=The Russian Roots of Nazism: White \u00c9migr\u00e9s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917\u20131945 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-84512-0 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511079498&ss=exc}}</ref> Therefore, his conclusion is that White \u00e9migr\u00e9s were at the source of the Nazi concept of Jewish Bolshevism. Annemarie Sammartino argues that this view is contestable. While there is no doubt that White emigres were instrumental in reinforcing the idea of 'Jewish Bolshevism' among Nazis, the concept is also found in many German early post\u2013World War I documents. Also, Germany had its own share of Jewish Communists \"to provide fodder for the paranoid fantasies of German antisemites\" without Russian Bolsheviks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12282 |title=Michael Kellogg: ''The Russian Roots of Nazism'' (review) |first=Annemarie |last=Sammartino |work=Humanities and Social Sciences Net |date=September 2006 |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, Hitler declared that the mission of the Nazi movement was to destroy \"Jewish Bolshevism\".{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=257}} Hitler asserted that the \"three vices\" of \"Jewish Marxism\" were democracy, pacifism and internationalism,{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=303}} and that the Jews were behind Bolshevism, communism and Marxism.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=259}}\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], this concept of Jewish Bolshevism reflected a common perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led movement seeking world domination from its origin. The term was popularized in print in German journalist [[Dietrich Eckhart]]'s 1924 pamphlet \"{{lang|de|italic=no|Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin}}\" (\"Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin\") which depicted [[Moses]] and Lenin as both being Communists and Jews. This was followed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s 1923 edition of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925, which saw Bolshevism as \"Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself\".\n\nAccording to French spymaster and writer [[Henri Rollin]], \"Hitlerism\" was based on \"anti-Soviet counter-revolution\" promoting the \"myth of a mysterious Jewish\u2013Masonic\u2013Bolshevik plot\", entailing that the [[First World War]] had been instigated by a vast Jewish\u2013Masonic conspiracy to topple the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires and implement Bolshevism by fomenting liberal ideas.{{sfn|Kellogg|2008}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nA major source for [[propaganda]] about Jewish Bolshevism in the 1930s and early 1940s was the pro-Nazi and antisemitic international ''Welt-Dienst'' news agency founded in 1933 by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].\n\nWithin the German Army, a tendency to see Soviet Communism as a Jewish conspiracy had grown since the First World War, something that became officialized under the Nazis. A 1932 pamphlet by [[Ewald Banse]] of the Government-financed German National Association for the Military Sciences described the Soviet leadership as mostly Jewish, dominating an apathetic and mindless Russian population.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2005|p=119}}\n\n[[File:German antisemitic and anti-Soviet poster.JPG|thumb|upright|German antisemitic and anti-Soviet propaganda poster, written in the Polish language.

One option was to recognize the structural link between the oppression of the Jews and their involvement in the Left, and to introduce social and political reforms which ended discrimination against Jews... This option would have meant accepting that Jews had as much right as any other religious or ethnic grouping to freely participate in political activities. The second option... was to reject any social or political emancipation of Jews... Instead, this policy blamed the Jewish victims for their persecution, and assumed that anti-Semitic legislation and violence was justified as a response to the alleged threat of \u2018Jewish Bolshevism\u2019. In short, cause and effect were reversed, and Jewish responses to anti-Semitism were utilized to rationalize anti-Semitic practices.<ref name=\"Mendes 2014\"/>}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cultural Bolshevism]]\n*[[Frankfurt School#Conspiracy theory|Cultural Marxism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Alderman\n  | first = G.\n  | title = The Jewish Community in British Politics\n  | publisher = Clarendon Press\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 1983\n  | page = 102\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ascher\n  | first = Abraham\n  | author-link = Berel Wein\n  | title = The Revolution of 1905\n  | publisher = Stanford University Press\n  | location = Palo Alto\n  | year = 1992\n  | isbn = \n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite news\n  | last = Churchill\n  | first = Winston\n  | authorlink = Winston Churchill\n  | title = Zionism versus Bolshevism\n  | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Zionism_versus_Bolshevism\n  | newspaper = Illustrated Sunday Herald\n  | date = 8 February 1920\n  | ref = {{harvid|Churchill|8 February 1920}}\n  }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Evans\n  | first = Richard J.\n  | title = In Hitler's Shadow West German Historians and the Attempt to Escape the Nazi Past\n  | publisher = Pantheon\n  | location = New York\n  | year = 1989\n  | isbn = 978-0-394-57686-2\n  | ref = harv\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/inhitlersshadow00rich\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Figes\n  | first = Orlando\n  | title = The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia\n  | publisher = Picador\n  | location = London\n  | year = 2008\n  | isbn = \n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = F\u00f6rster\n  | first = J\u00fcrgen\n  | authorlink = J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster\n  | contribution = The German Military's Image of Russia\n  | editor1-last = Erickson\n  | editor1-first = Ljubica\n  | editor2-last = Erickson\n  | editor2-first = Mark \n  | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy\n  | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson\n  | location = London\n  | year = 2005\n  | isbn =\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* Friedman, Isaiah (1997).

Germans, according to Rosenberg, had been responsible for Russia's historic achievements and had been sidelined by the Bolsheviks, who did not represent the interests of the Russian people, but instead those of its ethnic Jewish and Chinese population.{{sfn|Laqueur|1990|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nMichael Kellogg, in his Ph.D. thesis, argues that the racist ideology of Nazis was to a significant extent influenced by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9]]s in Germany, many of whom, while being former subjects of the Russian Empire, were of non-Russian descent: [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|ethnic Germans]], residents of Baltic lands including [[Baltic Germans]], and [[Ukrainians]]. Of particular role was their ''Aufbau'' organization (Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung f\u00fcr den Osten (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organization for the East)). For example, its leader was instrumental in making ''The Protocols of The Elders of Zion'' available in German language. He argues that early Hitler was rather [[philosemitic]], and became rabidly antisemitic since 1919 under the influence of the White \u00e9migr\u00e9 convictions about the conspiracy of the Jews, an unseen unity from financial capitalists to Bolsheviks, to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Kellogg |title=The Russian Roots of Nazism: White \u00c9migr\u00e9s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917\u20131945 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-84512-0 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511079498&ss=exc}}</ref> Therefore, his conclusion is that White \u00e9migr\u00e9s were at the source of the Nazi concept of Jewish Bolshevism. Annemarie Sammartino argues that this view is contestable. While there is no doubt that White emigres were instrumental in reinforcing the idea of 'Jewish Bolshevism' among Nazis, the concept is also found in many German early post\u2013World War I documents. Also, Germany had its own share of Jewish Communists \"to provide fodder for the paranoid fantasies of German antisemites\" without Russian Bolsheviks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12282 |title=Michael Kellogg: ''The Russian Roots of Nazism'' (review) |first=Annemarie |last=Sammartino |work=Humanities and Social Sciences Net |date=September 2006 |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, Hitler declared that the mission of the Nazi movement was to destroy \"Jewish Bolshevism\".{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=257}} Hitler asserted that the \"three vices\" of \"Jewish Marxism\" were democracy, pacifism and internationalism,{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=303}} and that the Jews were behind Bolshevism, communism and Marxism.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=259}}\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], this concept of Jewish Bolshevism reflected a common perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led movement seeking world domination from its origin. The term was popularized in print in German journalist [[Dietrich Eckhart]]'s 1924 pamphlet \"{{lang|de|italic=no|Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin}}\" (\"Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin\") which depicted [[Moses]] and Lenin as both being Communists and Jews. This was followed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s 1923 edition of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925, which saw Bolshevism as \"Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself\".\n\nAccording to French spymaster and writer [[Henri Rollin]], \"Hitlerism\" was based on \"anti-Soviet counter-revolution\" promoting the \"myth of a mysterious Jewish\u2013Masonic\u2013Bolshevik plot\", entailing that the [[First World War]] had been instigated by a vast Jewish\u2013Masonic conspiracy to topple the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires and implement Bolshevism by fomenting liberal ideas.{{sfn|Kellogg|2008}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nA major source for [[propaganda]] about Jewish Bolshevism in the 1930s and early 1940s was the pro-Nazi and antisemitic international ''Welt-Dienst'' news agency founded in 1933 by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].\n\nWithin the German Army, a tendency to see Soviet Communism as a Jewish conspiracy had grown since the First World War, something that became officialized under the Nazis. A 1932 pamphlet by [[Ewald Banse]] of the Government-financed German National Association for the Military Sciences described the Soviet leadership as mostly Jewish, dominating an apathetic and mindless Russian population.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2005|p=119}}\n\n[[File:German antisemitic and anti-Soviet poster.JPG|thumb|upright|German antisemitic and anti-Soviet propaganda poster, written in the Polish language.

In the pamphlet ''The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization'', published in 1936, ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|We shall take care that never again in Germany, the heart of Europe, will the Jewish-Bolshevistic revolution of subhumans be able to be kindled either from within or through emissaries from without.{{sfn|Himmler|1936|p=8}}}}\n\nIn his speech to the ''Reichstag'' justifying [[Operation Barbarossa]] in 1941, Hitler said:\n\n{{quote|For more than two decades the Jewish Bolshevik regime in Moscow had tried to set fire not merely to Germany but to all of Europe&nbsp;...

In the article, which asserted that [[Zionism]] and Bolshevism were engaged in a \"struggle for the soul of the Jewish people\", he called on Jews to repudiate \"the Bolshevik conspiracy\" and make clear that \"the Bolshevik movement is not a Jewish movement\" but stated that:\n\n<blockquote>[Bolshevism] among the Jews is nothing new. From the days of [[Adam Weishaupt|Spartacus-Weishaupt]] to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), [[Bela Kun]] (Hungary), [[Rosa Luxemburg]] (Germany), and [[Emma Goldman]] (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing.{{sfn|Churchill|1920}}</blockquote>\n\nAuthor [[Gisela C.

It included a foreword by the German [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] who promulgated the concept of \"Jewish Bolshevism\".\n\nThis relatively obscure publication embodies the Nazi doctrine that \"[[Jews|Jewishness]]\" and [[Bolshevism]] are the same; or that Bolshevism is Jewish, whether everything Jewish is included within Bolshevism. The methodology used consists of identifying Bolsheviks as Jews; by birth, or by name or by [[demographics]].\n\nAccording to Singerman, ''The Jewish Bolshevism'', which he dubs as item \"0121\" in his Bibliography, is \"Identical in content to item '0120', the pamphlet ''The Grave Diggers of Russia'', which was published in 1921 in Germany, by Dr. [[E.

This option would have meant accepting that Jews had as much right as any other religious or ethnic grouping to freely participate in political activities. The second option... was to reject any social or political emancipation of Jews... Instead, this policy blamed the Jewish victims for their persecution, and assumed that anti-Semitic legislation and violence was justified as a response to the alleged threat of \u2018Jewish Bolshevism\u2019.
