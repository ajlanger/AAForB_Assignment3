In return, you pledge not to restrict others' use of these seeds or their derivatives by patents or other means, and to include this Pledge with any transfer of these seeds or their derivatives.\" Use of the Pledge ensures the four open source seed freedoms for this and future generations, including: \n# The freedom to save or grow seed for replanting or for any other purpose.\n# The freedom to share, trade, or sell seed to others.\n# The freedom to trial and study seed and to share or publish information about it.\n# The freedom to select or adapt the seed, make crosses with it, or use it to breed new lines and varieties.\nOSSI's mission bears some similarities to the mission of organizations such as Seed Savers Exchange, but it is different in that OSSI provides an explicit Pledge with its seeds that is designed to keep seeds free through the establishment of a protected commons. OSSI differs from [[plant breeders' rights]] and [[plant variety protection]] in that the Pledge allows recipients to do anything they want with the seed except restrict it. In addition, it automatically extends the Pledge to new varieties developed from OSSI-Pledged parents. In addition, OSSI does not Pledge heirlooms or indigenous varieties. It only Pledges varieties contributed and Pledged by their breeders.\n\nOSSI involves plant breeders and seed company partners in its mission. First OSSI works with plant breeders who commit to making one or more of their varieties available exclusively under the OSSI Pledge. OSSI Partner Seed Companies sell OSSI-Pledged varieties, acknowledge the OSSI breeders in their variety descriptions, label OSSI-Pledged varieties with the OSSI logo, and include the Pledge and information about OSSI in their catalogs and on their websites. The Seed List of OSSI-Pledged varieties gives complete descriptions and photos for each OSSI-Pledged variety and links to every OSSI Partner Seed Company that carries each variety.\n\nOSSI also places articles in magazines for gardeners and farmers during the seed ordering season so as to attract visitors to its website and channel those visitors to its seed company partners where they can buy the seed. See, for example, Carol Deppe's article in the January issue of ''Acres/USA-'' [[Osseeds.org|Thirty-three Great Open-Source Organic-Adapted Vegetable Varieties]]. OSSI thus creates a market for ethically produced, \"freed seed\" analogous to the markets for \"fair trade\" and \"organic\" products.\n\n== Influences and early history ==\n\nThe work of University of Wisconsin sociologist Jack Kloppenburg, particularly his book ''First the Seed:The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492-2000'' (2nd ed.)<ref>https://www.amazon.com/First-Seed-Political-Biotechnology-Technology/dp/029919244X </ref> influenced the development of OSSI. Originally published in 1990, then updated in 2000, this book chronicles the vast changes in seed sovereignty that took place during the 20th century through the rise of modern plant breeding approaches, the expansion of intellectual property rights, and emerging crop biotechnologies. Kloppenburg's work explored global consequences of legal control over crop seeds during an era of heavy consolidation in the seed industry. Kloppenburg himself was inspired by the work of writers and activists Pat Roy Mooney, a Canadian, and Cary Fowler, an American, who began engaging with issues of the public versus private ownership of seed and genetic resources in the 1970s. While some of these views were criticized by plant breeders in the 1980s and 1990s, Kloppenburg argued that the expansion of intellectual property rights over crop genetic resources, including cultivars, genes, and plant traits, is an issue of concern for the future of global agriculture. Kloppenburg documented the ever-increasing encroachments upon the traditional rights of farmers, gardeners, and plant breeders to save, replant, share, or breed with seed, as well as forced plant breeders and all others interested in crop genetic resources to confront the degree to which they had lost or were losing \"freedom to operate\" with their seeds. (This term \"freedom to operate\" has come to mean the degree to which seeds and the genes contained in those seeds can be freely used by breeders, gardeners, farmers, and seed producers without legal restriction.)\n\nOne of the consequences of an increasing global awareness of the finite nature of crop genetic resources and the debate over ownership of these resources has been the establishment of gene banks and seed banks in many countries, notably Fowler's recent efforts to develop the Svalbard Global Seed Vault off the coast of Norway in the Arctic Svalbard Archipelago. Kloppenburg's focus on the ownership and control of those resources still remains one of the most pressing questions for future generations.\n\nInternational efforts, coordinated through the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations and the [[United Nations Environment Program]], and manifest through agreements such as the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], have sought global solutions to sustainable and fair use of the planet's crop genetic resources. While these efforts are ongoing, significant limitations to global [[germplasm]] exchange still challenge and limit their potential gains.\n\nBuilding from these ideas, plant breeder Thomas Michaels proposed [[General Public License]] for Plant Germplasm (GPLPG) in 1999. The objective of the license was to build a pool of shared plant germplasm that could be freely used for breeding new crop varieties. The two key features of this license were 1) that GPLPG varieties were freely available for use in as a parent any breeding program and 2) that new varieties developed using one or more GPLPG parents must also be designated as GPLPG. The license was explicitly modeled on the General Public License that had been developed by Richard Stallman and others in the computer software community. General Public License for Plant Germplasm was the first license of its kind to treat the plant genotype as if it were computer source code that can be freely used in a new program (crop variety) so long as the new program (crop variety) is also designated as General Public License.\n\nOpen Source Seed Initiative, founded some 15 years later, creates a seed commons involving the method of germplasm exchange based upon a Pledge. Any user can gain access to the germplasm and use it for any purpose, as long as they pledge not to restrict others' use of this same germplasm as well as to pass the Pledge along if they share or sell the germplasm. OSSI provides maximal freedom to operate for those who wish to save, replant, share, sell, trade, breed, and otherwise innovate with seeds.\n\n== Release of OSSI varieties and current activity ==\n\nIn April 2014, the OSSI released its first 36 open-source seed varieties.<ref name=\"VQR\" />\n\nNPR opined in their report in 2014 that large seed companies would be unlikely to use open-source seeds, as patented seeds are more profitable. And they speculated that farmers may have trouble finding open-source seeds for sale.<ref name=\"NPR\" /> However by July, 2017, OSSI had over 375 varieties of more than 50 crops bred by 36 breeders and being sold by 46 seed company partners. While varieties have been contributed by public sector plant breeders at universities and not-for-profit organizations, most OSSI varieties have been contributed by freelance plant breeders and seed companies.\n\nOn 10 August 2015 an OSSI-Pledged red [[romaine lettuce]] variety called 'Outredgeous' bred by farmer-breeder Frank Morton became the first plant variety to be planted, harvested and eaten entirely in space, as a part of [[Expedition 44]] to the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news|last1=Brownlee|first1=Lisa|title=International Space Station Astronauts Look Forward To Today's First Taste Of Space Harvest|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisabrownlee/2015/08/10/international-space-station-astronauts-look-forward-to-todays-first-taste-of-space-harvest/#20b0f0d01172|accessdate=26 February 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|date=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nOSSI has also become a topic of academic research in both the biological and social sciences.
