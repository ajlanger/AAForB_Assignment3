Crackle! and Pop! came later, and since 1939, the three have been together in many forms of advertising, including radio, movie shorts, and comic strips.  An updated version of the elf-like Snap! Crackle! and Pop! appeared for the first time on television in 1960; before that it was advertised by [[Woody Woodpecker]].  They are the first and longest-running cartoon characters to represent a Kellogg's product.<ref name=\"ricebubblesau\">[http://www.kelloggs.com.au/Home/Products/Cereal/RiceBubbles/SnapCrackleandPop/tabid/477/Default.aspx Rice Bubbles: The history of Snap, Crackle and Pop!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428061108/http://www.kelloggs.com.au/Home/Products/Cereal/RiceBubbles/SnapCrackleandPop/tabid/477/Default.aspx |date=April 28, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Taglines ===\n*Snap!
