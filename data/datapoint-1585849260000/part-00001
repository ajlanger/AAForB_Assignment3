A second [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Scott Spencer (writer)|Scott Spencer]]'s novel, the film stars [[Alex Pettyfer]], [[Gabriella Wilde]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Joely Richardson]], and [[Robert Patrick]].\n\nThe film was released on February 14, 2014 by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in the US and UK, and on February 13, 2014 in Australia.\n\n==Plot==\nReserved, lovely 17-year-old Jade ([[Gabriella Wilde]]) graduates from high school with an impressive college scholarship but few friends, having focused on her studies rather than a social life. David ([[Alex Pettyfer]]), another graduating senior, has had a crush on her for years but never acted on it.\n\nHoping to make some summer memories, Jade asks her parents, Hugh ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) and Anne ([[Joely Richardson]]), for a graduation party. She invites the entire class, including David. The two hit it off and are caught fooling around in a closet during the party. Hugh worries that David's impulsive and carefree nature will adversely affect his daughter, who is preparing to leave for a medical-school internship.\n\nDavid, who works at his widower-father Harry's garage, tries to please Hugh by fixing a car which belonged to Jade's brother Chris...who died of cancer years ago. Ironically, Hugh is the only one ''not'' pleased by David's gesture. Late that night, Jade invites David into her family's study where - at her own urging - they make love. The two strive to make the most of the ten days she has left at home. Ultimately, Jade opts to decline the internship and spend the rest of the summer with David...which infuriates Hugh. Later, Jade invites David to accompany the family to their lake house; he is welcomed with open arms by everybody except Hugh, whom Anne urges to give David a chance. Anne points out that Jade seems truly happy for the first time since Chris passed away. \n\nOne night, David sees Hugh cheating on Anne with another woman; the next morning Hugh intimidates David into keeping quiet about the affair. David and Jade, along with Jade's brother Keith and his girlfriend Sabine, sneak into a local zoo after-hours for a night of fun. Jenny, David's jealous ex-girlfriend, calls the police; when they arrive, David allows himself to be caught so the others can escape. Hugh agrees to bail David out, on the condition that he breaks up with Jade and she takes the internship as planned. \n\nAgainst Hugh's orders, Jade goes to meet David at a restaurant where he's eating with his friend Mace...who, unbeknownst to either David or Jade, has invited Jenny (he figured David could use a sympathetic ear, after being forced to stop seeing Jade). Jade suddenly turns up, and jumps to the obvious-but-wrong conclusion; frustrated, she drives off and gets into an accident. At the hospital, Hugh gives Harry a restraining order to keep David away from Jade...who has suffered only minor injuries. Upon leaving the hospital, she tries to contact David - having realized by now that he was never unfaithful to her and never would be. But Harry won't allow this because it would land his son in prison. Over the next few months, David and Jade each attempt to move on with their lives by seeing other people; still, both are unhappy. \n\nDavid runs into Anne at a bookstore. She tells him that - despite the tension between her and Hugh - she admires his and Jade's love for each other. Anne arranges for David to meet Jade at the airport when she comes home for the holidays. The couple reaffirm their love, and Jade plans to move in with David that night, while Anne confronts Hugh about his obsession with destroying Jade's life. Anne also learns that Hugh prevented her recommendation letter for David from being sent out to college.\n\nBack at home, Hugh reams Keith and Sabine for listening to records from Chris's collection. Keith seconds his mother's sentiments regarding what losing Chris has done to Hugh. When Keith subsequently announces that he's moving in with Sabine, Anne opts for going with him. Hugh then finds Jade preparing to leave with David, who is waiting outside. Hugh charges outside in a rage, knocking over a burning candle on the way, and furiously attacks David with a baseball bat. Jade rushes to his defense...proclaiming that it was Hugh himself, not David, who tore their family apart. The defeated Hugh goes back inside, and discovers the fire which has started in Chris's room; Jade and David see the house in flames, so David rushes back in to save Jade's father, who is struggling to gather up Chris' possessions. When David falls unconscious, Hugh decides to leave the things and help David to safety instead. Outside, David and Hugh put aside their differences while they wait for medical attention. \n\nAnne and Hugh amicably separate but remain determined to rediscover the love, inspired by Jade and David. Jade meets David at the airport and they fly to California to be maid of honor and best man at Sabine and Keith's wedding. Both couples celebrate on the beach, where they camp for the night. Lying next to David, Jade fondly recalls how her first love, the relationship she shares with David was everything all at once, the kind of undying love worth fighting to keep.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gabriella Wilde]] as Jade Butterfield\n* [[Alex Pettyfer]] as David Elliot\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Hugh Butterfield\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Anne Butterfield\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Harry Elliot\n* [[Rhys Wakefield]] as Keith Butterfield \n* [[Dayo Okeniyi]] as Mace\n* [[Emma Rigby]] as Jenny\n* Anna Enger as Sabine\n* [[Patrick Johnson (actor)|Patrick Johnson]] as Chris Butterfield\n* Alexandra Bartee as Kelly\n* Sharon Conley as Dr. Edie Watanabe\n* Stephanie Northrup as Dawn Besser\n* Matt Withers as Miles\n\n==Production==\n[[Emma Roberts]] was originally offered the role of Jade, but turned it down.
