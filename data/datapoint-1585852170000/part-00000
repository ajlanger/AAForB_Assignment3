He has been awarded several prizes, not only within the field of poetry but also for his contributions to theatre and opera.\n\nGala's work has been more appreciated by his readership than by the critics, who find it hard to classify it due to its particular blend of lyricism and epic.\n\nAmong his most successful plays are ''Los verdes campos del Ed\u00e9n'' (''The Green Fields of Eden'', National Theatre Prize \"Calder\u00f3n de la Barca\" 1963), ''Anillos para una dama'' (''Rings for a Lady'', 1973), ''\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 corres, Ulises?'' (''Why do you run, Ulysses?'', 1975), ''Petra Regalada'' (1980), ''Samarkanda'' (1985), ''Carmen, Carmen'' (1988) and ''La truhana'' (''The rogue'', 1992).\n\nAmong his collections of poetry are ''Sonetos de La Zubia'' (La Zubia Sonets), ''Poemas de amor'' (''Love Poems''), ''Testamento Andaluz'' (''Andalusian Will'') and ''Enemigo \u00edntimo'' (''Intimate Enemy'', Adonais Prize 1959).\n\nHe started to write novels late in life, but he obtained an overwhelming success with ''El manuscrito carmes\u00ed'' (''The Crimson Manuscript'', Planeta Prize 1990), ''\u00c1guila Bic\u00e9fala'' (''Two-Headed Eagle'', 1994), ''La regla de tres'' (''The Rule of Three'', 1996) and ''La pasi\u00f3n turca'' (''Turkish Passion'', 1993), adapted for the cinema by Spanish director [[Vicente Aranda]] and'' M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del Jard\u00edn'' (''Beyond the Garden'', 1995), adapted by [[Pedro Olea]].\n\nGala's literature is marked by historic issues, which are used more to lighten the present than to deepen in the past.\n\nHe is the current president of the International Theatre Institute.\n\n== Political views ==\nDuring the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1976 to the early 1980s) Gala publicly defended leftist political view points while not linked to a specific political party. In 1978 he called for a [[statute of autonomy]] for [[Andalusia]].<ref>[http://elpais.com/diario/1978/04/04/cultura/260488803_850215.html Apertura del Congreso de Cultura Andaluza].
