He is the majority owner and co-founder of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He was the mayor of [[New York City]] from 2002 to 2013, and was briefly a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]].\n\nBloomberg grew up in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]].

He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor. He has also faced significant criticism for his expansion of the city's [[stop and frisk]] program.\n\nIn November 2019, Bloomberg officially launched [[Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the Democratic nomination for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He ended his campaign in March 2020, after having won only 61 delegates.

(Under New York's [[Electoral fusion|fusion]] rules, a candidate can run on more than one party's line and combine all the votes received.)

(born February 14, 1942) is an American businessman, politician, philanthropist, and author. He is the majority owner and co-founder of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He was the mayor of [[New York City]] from 2002 to 2013, and was briefly a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]].\n\nBloomberg grew up in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]]. Pursuing [[Political positions of Michael Bloomberg|socially liberal and fiscally moderate policies]], Bloomberg developed a [[Technocracy|technocratic managerial style]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/01/nyregion/political-memo-bloomberg-the-technocrat-seeks-his-inner-la-guardia.html |title=Political Memo; Bloomberg, the Technocrat, Seeks His Inner La Guardia |author1=Cooper, Michael |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 1, 2003|accessdate=February 25, 2020|url-access=limited}}</ref> After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, he re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014.\n\nAs mayor of New York, Bloomberg established public [[charter school]]s, rebuilt urban infrastructure, and supported [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]], [[public health]] initiatives, and [[Environmental policy of the United States|environmental protections]]. He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor. He has also faced significant criticism for his expansion of the city's [[stop and frisk]] program.\n\nIn November 2019, Bloomberg officially launched [[Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the Democratic nomination for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He ended his campaign in March 2020, after having won only 61 delegates.

(Under New York's [[Electoral fusion|fusion]] rules, a candidate can run on more than one party's line and combine all the votes received.)
