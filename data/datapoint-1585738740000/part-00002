Later in November, Agresta was terminated by the department for a low call response percentage.  Agresta maintains that the termination was a political action taken by the department, spearheaded by his political opponent's brother and husband who are respectively the President and Chief of the department as retaliation for his candidacy for the office of Councilman.  Agresta has explained his low call response percentage by stating that he was on academic leave from the department.  He filed a suit for retaliatory termination and civil rights violations in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.<ref>http://www.northjersey.com/news/crimeandcourts/36362974.html</ref>  Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on September 2, 2009, the insurance company representing the defendants agreed to pay a portion of Agresta's legal fees.

Later in November, Agresta was terminated by the department for a low call response percentage.  Agresta maintains that the termination was a political action taken by the department, spearheaded by his political opponent's brother and husband who are respectively the President and Chief of the department as retaliation for his candidacy for the office of Councilman.  Agresta has explained his low call response percentage by stating that he was on academic leave from the department.  He filed a suit for retaliatory termination and civil rights violations in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.<ref>http://www.northjersey.com/news/crimeandcourts/36362974.html</ref>  Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on September 2, 2009, the insurance company representing the defendants agreed to pay a portion of Agresta's legal fees.
