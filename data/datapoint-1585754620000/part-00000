After the war he became a successful lawyer, and went on to join the governments of [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellors]] [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. In 1938, Schuschnigg resigned in the face of a German invasion, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed his successor. The newly installed Nazis proceeded to transfer power to Germany, and Austria subsequently became the German province of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]], with Seyss-Inquart as its governor (''Reichsstatthalter'').\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Low Countries]] in [[World War II]], Seyss-Inquart was appointed ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' of the occupied Netherlands. He instituted a reign of terror, with Dutch civilians subjected to forced labour and the vast majority of Dutch Jews deported and murdered.\n\nAt the [[Nuremberg trials]], Seyss-Inquart was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]], sentenced to death, and executed.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Arthur Seyss-Inquart (1925).jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Seyss-Inquart in 1925]]\nSeyss-Inquart was born in 1892 in [[Stona\u0159ov|Stannern]] ({{lang-cs|Stona\u0159ov}}), a German-speaking village in the neighbourhood of the predominantly German-speaking town of [[Jihlava|Iglau]] ({{lang-cs|Jihlava}}). This area constituted a German linguistic island in the midst of a [[Czech language|Czech]]-speaking environment and this situation may have contributed to the outspoken national consciousness of the family and the young Arthur in particular. Iglau was an important town in [[Moravia]], one of the Czech provinces of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], in which an increasing competition between Germans and Czechs was going on. His parents were the school principal Emil Seyss-Inquart and Augusta Hirenbach.\n\nThe family moved to [[Vienna]] in 1907. Seyss-Inquart later went to study [[jurisprudence|law]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. At the beginning of [[World War I]] in August 1914 Seyss-Inquart enlisted with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian Army]] and was given a commission with the [[German Tyrol|Tyrolean]] ''Kaiserj\u00e4ger'', subsequently serving in [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russia]], [[Romania during World War I|Romania]] and [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]]. He was decorated for bravery on a number of occasions and, while recovering from wounds in 1917, he completed his final examinations for his degree. Seyss-Inquart had five older siblings: Hedwig (born 1881), Richard (born 3 April 1883, became a Catholic priest, but left the Church and ministry, married in civil ceremony and became ''Oberregierungsrat'' and prison superior by 1940 in the [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]), Irene (born 1885), Henriette (born 1887) and Robert (born 1891).\n\nIn 1911, Seyss-Inquart met Gertrud Maschka. The couple married in December 1916 and had three children: Ingeborg Carolina Augusta Seyss-Inquart (born 18 September 1917), Richard Seyss-Inquart (born 22 August 1921) and Dorothea Seyss-Inquart (born 7 May 1928).\n\n== Political career and the ''Anschluss'' ==\nHe went into law after the war and in 1921 set up his own practice. During the early years of the [[Austrian First Republic]], he was close to the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]]. A successful lawyer, he was invited to join the [[cabinet (politics)|cabinet]] of Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in 1933. Following Dollfuss' murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. A keen mountaineer, Seyss-Inquart became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to [[Tibet]] and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving [[Aryan race|Aryan racial concepts]] and theories. He was not initially a member of the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialist]] party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Louis L.|authorlink1=Louis Leo Snyder|title=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich|date=1976|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=320}}</ref> By 1938, however, Seyss-Inquart knew which way the political wind was blowing and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-5243, Wien, Arthur Sey\u00df-Inquart, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|Seyss-Inquart with Hitler, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] in Vienna, 1938]]\n\nIn February 1938, Seyss-Inquart was appointed Austrian [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Minister of the Interior]] by Schuschnigg, after [[Adolf Hitler]] had threatened Schuschnigg with military actions against Austria in the event of non-compliance. On 11 March 1938, faced with a German invasion aimed at preventing a [[plebiscite]] of independence, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor.  Under growing pressure from Berlin, President [[Wilhelm Miklas]] reluctantly appointed Seyss-Inquart his successor. On the next day German troops crossed the border of Austria at the [[telegraph]]ed invitation of Seyss-Inquart.  This telegram had actually been drafted beforehand and was released after the troops had begun to march, so as to justify the action in the eyes of the international community. Before his triumphant entry into [[Vienna]], Hitler had planned to leave Austria as a pro-Nazi puppet state headed by Seyss-Inquart. However, the acclamation for the German army from the majority of the Austrian population led Hitler to change course and opt for a full ''Anschluss,'' in which Austria was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] as the province of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] (see [[Anschluss]]). Only then, on 13 March 1938, did Seyss-Inquart join the Nazi Party.<ref name=Judseyss>{{Cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judseyss.asp |title=Judgement : Seyss-Inquart |publisher=[[Avalon Project|The Avalon Project]]}}</ref>\n\n== Head of Ostmark and Southern Poland ==\n\nSeyss-Inquart drafted the legislative act reducing Austria to a province of Germany and signed it into law on 13 March. With Hitler's approval he became Governor (''[[Reichsstatthalter]]'') of the newly named Ostmark, thus becoming Hitler's personal representative in Austria. [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] served as chief minister and [[Josef Burckel]] as Commissioner for the Reunion of Austria (concerned with the \"Jewish Question\"). Seyss-Inquart also received an honorary [[SS]] rank of [[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]] and in May 1939 he was made a [[Minister without portfolio]] in [[Cabinet Hitler|Hitler's cabinet]].  Almost as soon as he took office, he ordered the confiscation of Jewish property and sent Jews to concentration camps.  Late in his regime, he collaborated in the deportation of Jews from Austria.\n\nFollowing the invasion of [[Poland]], Seyss-Inquart became administrative chief for Southern Poland, but did not take up that post before the [[General Government]] was created, in which he became a deputy to the [[Governor General]] [[Hans Frank]]. He fully supported the heavy-handed policies put into effect by Frank, including persecution of Jews.  He was also aware of the [[Abwehr]]'s murder of Polish intellectuals.\n\n==Reichskommissar in the Netherlands==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-1976, Arthur Sey\u00df-Inquart.jpg|thumb|left|Seyss-Inquart in [[The Hague]] (1940)]]\n\nFollowing the capitulation of the [[Low Countries]] Seyss-Inquart was appointed [[Reichskommissar]] for the Occupied Netherlands in May 1940, charged with directing the civil administration, with creating close economic collaboration with Germany and with defending the interests of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]]. Among the Dutch people he was mockingly referred to as \"Zes en een kwart\" (six and a quarter), a play on his name, and the fact that Seyss-Inquart suffered from a limp. He supported the Dutch [[Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging|NSB]] and allowed them to create a paramilitary ''Landwacht'', which acted as an auxiliary police force. Other political parties were banned in late 1941 and many former government officials were imprisoned at [[Sint-Michielsgestel]]. The administration of the country was controlled by Seyss-Inquart himself and he answered directly to Hitler.<ref name=\"OSS Biography\">{{cite web|work = Donovan Nuremberg Trials Collection|title = Biographical Sketch: Seyss-Inquart, Arthur |url =http://hydrastg.library.cornell.edu/fedora/objects/nur:01572/datastreams/pdf/content |publisher = [[Cornell University Law Library]] / [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Research and Analysis Branch |date=27 August 1945 |accessdate = 27 October 2018}}</ref> He oversaw the politicization of cultural groups from the [[:nl:Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer|Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer]] \"right down to 'the chessplayers' club\", and set up a number of other politicised associations.\n\nHe introduced measures to combat resistance, and when a widespread strike took place in [[Amsterdam]], [[Arnhem]] and [[Hilversum]] in May 1943, special summary [[court-martial]] procedures were brought in, and a collective fine of 18 million [[guilder]]s was imposed. Up until the liberation, Seyss-Inquart authorized the execution of around 800 people, although some reports put this total at over 1,500, including the executions of people under the so-called \"Hostage Law\", the death of political prisoners who were close to being liberated, the [[Putten raid]], and the reprisal executions of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader [[Hanns Albin Rauter]]. Although the majority of Seyss-Inquart's powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the [[Gestapo]] in July 1944, he remained a force to be reckoned with. It is thought he met with [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], an exiled leader of Palestinian Arabs, [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], somewhere in Germany in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/MAGAZINE-revealed-photos-of-palestinian-mufti-visiting-nazi-germany-1.5483980|title=Never-before-seen Photos of Palestinian Mufti With Hitler Ties Visiting Nazi Germany|first=Ofer|last=Aderet|date=15 June 2017|publisher=|work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref>\n\nThere were three [[concentration camp]]s in the Netherlands \u2013 the smaller [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|KZ Herzogenbusch]] near [[Vught]], [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Kamp Amersfoort]] near [[Amersfoort]], and [[Westerbork transit camp]] (a \"Jewish assembly camp\"); there were a number of other camps variously controlled by the military, the police, the SS or Seyss-lnquart's administration. These included a \"voluntary labour recruitment\" camp at [[Ommen]] ([[Kamp Erika|Camp Erika]]). In total around 530,000 Dutch civilians forcibly worked for the Germans, of whom 250,000 were sent to factories in Germany. There was an unsuccessful attempt by Seyss-Inquart to send only workers aged 21 to 23 to Germany, and he refused demands in 1944 for a further 250,000 Dutch workers and in that year sent only 12,000 people.\n\n[[File:Voorwerpen die Arthur Sey\u00df-Inquart ridiculiseren.jpg|thumb|Objects [[ridicule|ridiculing]] Seyss-Inquart, including a cigarette extinguisher made of six-and-quarter coins. Zes-en-een-kwart (six-and-a-quarter) was a commonly used [[nickname]] for Seyss-Inquart.  The quarter also refers to his crippled leg.]]\n\nSeyss-Inquart was an unwavering [[anti-Semite]]; within a few months of his arrival in the [[Netherlands]], he took measures to remove Jews from the government, the press and leading positions in industry. Anti-Jewish measures intensified after 1941: approximately 140,000 Jews were registered, a 'ghetto' was created in [[Amsterdam]] and a transit camp was set up at [[Westerbork concentration camp|Westerbork]]. Subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], a concentration camp located within Germany's borders, and to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], located in Upper Austria. Later, the Dutch Jews were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], the notorious complex operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. As Allied forces approached in September 1944, the remaining Jews at Westerbork were removed to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]], the SS-established concentration camp/ghetto in the Nazi German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia. Of the 140,000 that were registered, only 30,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands#The Holocaust|Dutch Jews]] survived the war.\n\nWhen the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] advanced into the Netherlands in late 1944, the Nazi regime had attempted to enact a [[scorched earth]] policy, and some docks and harbours were destroyed. Seyss-Inquart, however, was in agreement with Armaments Minister [[Albert Speer]] over the futility of such actions, and with the open connivance of many military commanders, they greatly limited the implementation of the scorched earth orders.<ref name=Judseyss /> At the very end of the \"[[Dutch famine of 1944|hunger winter]]\" in April 1945, Seyss-Inquart was with difficulty persuaded by the Allies to allow airplanes to [[Operations Manna and Chowhound|drop food for the hungry people of the occupied north-west of the country]]. Although he knew the war was lost, Seyss-Inquart did not want to surrender. This led General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] to snap: \"''Well, in any case, you are going to be shot''\". \"''That leaves me cold''\", Seyss-Inquart replied, to which Smith then retorted: \"''It will''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/civaff/ch28.htm |work=United States Army in World War II: Civil Affairs: Soldiers Become Governors|title= Chapter XXVIII: Piecemeal Liberation of the Netherlands Amid Serious Civilian Distress |authors=Harry L.

Cf. also [[Dwight Eisenhower]], ''[[Crusade in Europe]]'', London: Heinemann, 1949 (third printing), p. 455</ref>\n\nBefore Hitler committed suicide in April 1945, he named a new government headed by Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] in his [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], in which Seyss-Inquart replaced [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], who had long since fallen out of favour, as Foreign Minister. It was a token of the high regard Hitler felt for his Austrian comrade, at a time when he was rapidly disowning or being abandoned by so many of his other key lieutenants in the Third Reich. Unsurprisingly, at such a late stage in the war, Seyss-Inquart failed to achieve anything in his new office.\n\nHe remained in his posts until 7 May 1945, when, after a meeting with D\u00f6nitz to confirm his rescinding of the scorched earth orders, he was arrested on the Elbe Bridge at Hamburg by two members of the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]], one of whom was Norman Miller (birth name: Norbert Mueller), a German Jew from Nuremberg who had escaped to Britain at the age of 15 on a [[kindertransport]] just before the war and then returned to Germany as part of the British occupation forces.<ref>The Flash (A Fortnightly Edition Published by The Royal Welch Fusiliers), 10 December 1945, Front Page</ref> Miller's entire family had been killed at the [[Jungfernhof Camp]] in [[Riga]], Latvia in March 1942.\n\n== Nuremberg trials ==\n[[File:Arthur Seyss-Inquart N\u00fcrnberg.jpg|thumb|left|Seyss-Inquart (seated) talking to [[Wilhelm Frick]] at the Nuremberg trials.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Inquart.png|thumb|Seyss-Inquart's body after his execution.]] -->\nAt the [[Nuremberg trials]], Seyss-Inquart was defended by Gustav Steinbauer and faced four charges: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity. During the trial, [[Gustave Gilbert]], an American army psychologist, was allowed to examine the Nazi leaders who were tried at Nuremberg for war crimes. Among other tests, a German version of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|Wechsler-Bellevue]] [[IQ test]] was administered. Arthur Seyss-Inquart scored 141, the second highest among the defendants, behind [[Hjalmar Schacht]].\n\nIn his final statement, Seyss-Inquart denied knowledge of various war crimes including the shooting of hostages, and said that while he had moral objections to the deportation of Jews, there must sometimes be justifications for mass evacuations, and pointed to the Allies forcibly resettling millions of Germans after the war. He added that his \"conscience was untroubled\" as he improved the conditions of the Dutch people while [[Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood|Commissioner]]. Seyss-Inquart concluded by saying, \"My last word is the principle by which I have always acted and to which I will adhere to my last breath: I believe in Germany.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.go2war2.nl/artikel/4571/Final-statement-Arthur-Seyss-Inquart.htm|title=Final statement Arthur Seyss-Inquart|website=Go2War2.nl |publisher=[[STIWOT]] |language=nl|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeyss-Inquart was acquitted of conspiracy, but convicted on all other counts and sentenced to death by hanging. The final judgment against him cited his involvement in harsh suppression of Nazi opponents and atrocities against the Jews during all his billets, but particularly stressed his reign of terror in the Netherlands. It was these atrocities that sent him to the gallows.\n\nUpon hearing of his death sentence, Seyss-Inquart was fatalistic: \"Death by hanging... well, in view of the whole situation, I never expected anything different. It's all right.\"<ref>[[G. M. Gilbert]], ''Nuremberg Diary'' (1947), Farrar Straus, page 433.</ref>\n\nBefore his execution, Seyss-Inquart returned to the [[Catholic church]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} receiving absolution in the sacrament of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] from [[prison chaplain]] Father Bruno Spitzl.\n\nHe was hanged in Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. He was the last to mount the scaffold, and his [[last words]] were the following: \"I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany.\"\n\nHis body, with those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann G\u00f6ring, was cremated at the [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]] in [[Munich]], and their ashes were scattered into the river [[Isar]].<ref>{{citation\n  |title=Ein Gl\u00fccksfall der Geschichte\n  |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39916258.html\n  |author=Thomas Darnst\u00e4dt\n  |work=[[Der Spiegel]]\n  |year=2005\n  |volume=14\n  |issue=14\n  |series=13 September\n  |pages=128\n  |quote=\n  |language=German\n}}</ref>{{sfn|Manvell|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}}\n{{-}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn [[Doris Orgel]]'s children's novel, ''The Devil in Vienna'', he is the father of Lise, the only [[Gentile]] friend of its Jewish character Inge Dournenvald, and his only daughter, second born after his son, Heinz.

served as [[Chancellor of Austria]] in 1938 for two days, before the annexation of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]] (the ''[[Anschluss]]'').\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Seyss-Inquart fought for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] with distinction. After the war he became a successful lawyer, and went on to join the governments of [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellors]] [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. In 1938, Schuschnigg resigned in the face of a German invasion, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed his successor. The newly installed Nazis proceeded to transfer power to Germany, and Austria subsequently became the German province of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]], with Seyss-Inquart as its governor (''Reichsstatthalter'').\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Low Countries]] in [[World War II]], Seyss-Inquart was appointed ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' of the occupied Netherlands. He instituted a reign of terror, with Dutch civilians subjected to forced labour and the vast majority of Dutch Jews deported and murdered.\n\nAt the [[Nuremberg trials]], Seyss-Inquart was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]], sentenced to death, and executed.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Arthur Seyss-Inquart (1925).jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Seyss-Inquart in 1925]]\nSeyss-Inquart was born in 1892 in [[Stona\u0159ov|Stannern]] (now {{lang|cs|Stona\u0159ov}}), a German-speaking village in the neighbourhood of the predominantly German-speaking town of [[Jihlava|Iglau]] (now {{lang|cs|Jihlava}}). This area constituted a German linguistic island in the midst of a [[Czech language|Czech]]-speaking environment and this situation may have contributed to the outspoken national consciousness of the family and the young Arthur in particular. Iglau was an important town in [[Moravia]], one of the Czech provinces of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], in which an increasing competition between Germans and Czechs was going on. His parents were the school principal Emil Seyss-Inquart and Augusta Hirenbach.\n\nThe family moved to [[Vienna]] in 1907. Seyss-Inquart later went to study [[jurisprudence|law]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. At the beginning of [[World War I]] in August 1914 Seyss-Inquart enlisted with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian Army]] and was given a commission with the [[German Tyrol|Tyrolean]] ''Kaiserj\u00e4ger'', subsequently serving in [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russia]], [[Romania during World War I|Romania]] and [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]]. He was decorated for bravery on a number of occasions and, while recovering from wounds in 1917, he completed his final examinations for his degree. Seyss-Inquart had five older siblings: Hedwig (born 1881), Richard (born 3 April 1883, became a Catholic priest, but left the Church and ministry, married in civil ceremony and became ''Oberregierungsrat'' and prison superior by 1940 in the [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]), Irene (born 1885), Henriette (born 1887) and Robert (born 1891).\n\nIn 1911, Seyss-Inquart met Gertrud Maschka. The couple married in December 1916 and had three children: Ingeborg Carolina Augusta Seyss-Inquart (born 18 September 1917), Richard Seyss-Inquart (born 22 August 1921) and Dorothea Seyss-Inquart (born 7 May 1928).\n\n== Political career and the ''Anschluss'' ==\nHe went into law after the war and in 1921 set up his own practice. During the early years of the [[Austrian First Republic]], he was close to the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]]. A successful lawyer, he was invited to join the [[cabinet (politics)|cabinet]] of Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in 1933. Following Dollfuss' murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. A keen mountaineer, Seyss-Inquart became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to [[Tibet]] and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving [[Aryan race|Aryan racial concepts]] and theories. He was not initially a member of the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialist]] party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Louis L.|authorlink1=Louis Leo Snyder|title=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich|date=1976|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=320}}</ref> By 1938, however, Seyss-Inquart knew which way the political wind was blowing and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-5243, Wien, Arthur Sey\u00df-Inquart, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|Seyss-Inquart with Hitler, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] in Vienna, 1938]]\n\nIn February 1938, Seyss-Inquart was appointed Austrian [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Minister of the Interior]] by Schuschnigg, after [[Adolf Hitler]] had threatened Schuschnigg with military actions against Austria in the event of non-compliance. On 11 March 1938, faced with a German invasion aimed at preventing a [[plebiscite]] of independence, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor.  Under growing pressure from Berlin, President [[Wilhelm Miklas]] reluctantly appointed Seyss-Inquart his successor. On the next day German troops crossed the border of Austria at the [[telegraph]]ed invitation of Seyss-Inquart.  This telegram had actually been drafted beforehand and was released after the troops had begun to march, so as to justify the action in the eyes of the international community. Before his triumphant entry into [[Vienna]], Hitler had planned to leave Austria as a pro-Nazi puppet state headed by Seyss-Inquart. However, the acclamation for the German army from the majority of the Austrian population led Hitler to change course and opt for a full ''Anschluss,'' in which Austria was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] as the province of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] (see [[Anschluss]]). Only then, on 13 March 1938, did Seyss-Inquart join the Nazi Party.<ref name=Judseyss>{{Cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judseyss.asp |title=Judgement : Seyss-Inquart |publisher=[[Avalon Project|The Avalon Project]]}}</ref>\n\n== Head of Ostmark and Southern Poland ==\n\nSeyss-Inquart drafted the legislative act reducing Austria to a province of Germany and signed it into law on 13 March. With Hitler's approval he became Governor (''[[Reichsstatthalter]]'') of the newly named Ostmark, thus becoming Hitler's personal representative in Austria. [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] served as chief minister and [[Josef Burckel]] as Commissioner for the Reunion of Austria (concerned with the \"Jewish Question\"). Seyss-Inquart also received an honorary [[SS]] rank of [[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]] and in May 1939 he was made a [[Minister without portfolio]] in [[Cabinet Hitler|Hitler's cabinet]].  Almost as soon as he took office, he ordered the confiscation of Jewish property and sent Jews to concentration camps.  Late in his regime, he collaborated in the deportation of Jews from Austria.\n\nFollowing the invasion of [[Poland]], Seyss-Inquart became administrative chief for Southern Poland, but did not take up that post before the [[General Government]] was created, in which he became a deputy to the [[Governor General]] [[Hans Frank]]. He fully supported the heavy-handed policies put into effect by Frank, including persecution of Jews.  He was also aware of the [[Abwehr]]'s murder of Polish intellectuals.\n\n==Reichskommissar in the Netherlands==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-1976, Arthur Sey\u00df-Inquart.jpg|thumb|left|Seyss-Inquart in [[The Hague]] (1940)]]\n\nFollowing the capitulation of the [[Low Countries]] Seyss-Inquart was appointed [[Reichskommissar]] for the Occupied Netherlands in May 1940, charged with directing the civil administration, with creating close economic collaboration with Germany and with defending the interests of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]]. Among the Dutch people he was mockingly referred to as \"Zes en een kwart\" (six and a quarter), a play on his name, and the fact that Seyss-Inquart suffered from a limp. He supported the Dutch [[Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging|NSB]] and allowed them to create a paramilitary ''Landwacht'', which acted as an auxiliary police force. Other political parties were banned in late 1941 and many former government officials were imprisoned at [[Sint-Michielsgestel]]. The administration of the country was controlled by Seyss-Inquart himself and he answered directly to Hitler.<ref name=\"OSS Biography\">{{cite web|work = Donovan Nuremberg Trials Collection|title = Biographical Sketch: Seyss-Inquart, Arthur |url =http://hydrastg.library.cornell.edu/fedora/objects/nur:01572/datastreams/pdf/content |publisher = [[Cornell University Law Library]] / [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Research and Analysis Branch |date=27 August 1945 |accessdate = 27 October 2018}}</ref> He oversaw the politicization of cultural groups from the [[:nl:Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer|Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer]] \"right down to 'the chessplayers' club\", and set up a number of other politicised associations.\n\nHe introduced measures to combat resistance, and when a widespread strike took place in [[Amsterdam]], [[Arnhem]] and [[Hilversum]] in May 1943, special summary [[court-martial]] procedures were brought in, and a collective fine of 18 million [[guilder]]s was imposed. Up until the liberation, Seyss-Inquart authorized the execution of around 800 people, although some reports put this total at over 1,500, including the executions of people under the so-called \"Hostage Law\", the death of political prisoners who were close to being liberated, the [[Putten raid]], and the reprisal executions of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader [[Hanns Albin Rauter]]. Although the majority of Seyss-Inquart's powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the [[Gestapo]] in July 1944, he remained a force to be reckoned with. It is thought he met with [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], an exiled leader of Palestinian Arabs, [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], somewhere in Germany in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/MAGAZINE-revealed-photos-of-palestinian-mufti-visiting-nazi-germany-1.5483980|title=Never-before-seen Photos of Palestinian Mufti With Hitler Ties Visiting Nazi Germany|first=Ofer|last=Aderet|date=15 June 2017|publisher=|work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref>\n\nThere were three [[concentration camp]]s in the Netherlands \u2013 the smaller [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|KZ Herzogenbusch]] near [[Vught]], [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Kamp Amersfoort]] near [[Amersfoort]], and [[Westerbork transit camp]] (a \"Jewish assembly camp\"); there were a number of other camps variously controlled by the military, the police, the SS or Seyss-lnquart's administration. These included a \"voluntary labour recruitment\" camp at [[Ommen]] ([[Kamp Erika|Camp Erika]]). In total around 530,000 Dutch civilians forcibly worked for the Germans, of whom 250,000 were sent to factories in Germany. There was an unsuccessful attempt by Seyss-Inquart to send only workers aged 21 to 23 to Germany, and he refused demands in 1944 for a further 250,000 Dutch workers and in that year sent only 12,000 people.\n\n[[File:Voorwerpen die Arthur Sey\u00df-Inquart ridiculiseren.jpg|thumb|Objects [[ridicule|ridiculing]] Seyss-Inquart, including a cigarette extinguisher made of six-and-quarter coins. Zes-en-een-kwart (six-and-a-quarter) was a commonly used [[nickname]] for Seyss-Inquart.  The quarter also refers to his crippled leg.]]\n\nSeyss-Inquart was an unwavering [[anti-Semite]]; within a few months of his arrival in the [[Netherlands]], he took measures to remove Jews from the government, the press and leading positions in industry. Anti-Jewish measures intensified after 1941: approximately 140,000 Jews were registered, a 'ghetto' was created in [[Amsterdam]] and a transit camp was set up at [[Westerbork concentration camp|Westerbork]]. Subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], a concentration camp located within Germany's borders, and to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], located in Upper Austria. Later, the Dutch Jews were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], the notorious complex operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. As Allied forces approached in September 1944, the remaining Jews at Westerbork were removed to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]], the SS-established concentration camp/ghetto in the Nazi German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia. Of the 140,000 that were registered, only 30,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands#The Holocaust|Dutch Jews]] survived the war.\n\nWhen the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] advanced into the Netherlands in late 1944, the Nazi regime had attempted to enact a [[scorched earth]] policy, and some docks and harbours were destroyed. Seyss-Inquart, however, was in agreement with Armaments Minister [[Albert Speer]] over the futility of such actions, and with the open connivance of many military commanders, they greatly limited the implementation of the scorched earth orders.<ref name=Judseyss /> At the very end of the \"[[Dutch famine of 1944|hunger winter]]\" in April 1945, Seyss-Inquart was with difficulty persuaded by the Allies to allow airplanes to [[Operations Manna and Chowhound|drop food for the hungry people of the occupied north-west of the country]]. Although he knew the war was lost, Seyss-Inquart did not want to surrender. This led General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] to snap: \"''Well, in any case, you are going to be shot''\". \"''That leaves me cold''\", Seyss-Inquart replied, to which Smith then retorted: \"''It will''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/civaff/ch28.htm |work=United States Army in World War II: Civil Affairs: Soldiers Become Governors|title= Chapter XXVIII: Piecemeal Liberation of the Netherlands Amid Serious Civilian Distress |authors=Harry L.

It was a token of the high regard Hitler felt for his Austrian comrade, at a time when he was rapidly disowning or being abandoned by so many of his other key lieutenants in the Third Reich. Unsurprisingly, at such a late stage in the war, Seyss-Inquart failed to achieve anything in his new office.\n\nHe remained in his posts until 7 May 1945, when, after a meeting with D\u00f6nitz to confirm his rescinding of the scorched earth orders, he was arrested on the Elbe Bridge at Hamburg by two members of the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]], one of whom was Norman Miller (birth name: Norbert Mueller), a German Jew from Nuremberg who had escaped to Britain at the age of 15 on a [[kindertransport]] just before the war and then returned to Germany as part of the British occupation forces.<ref>The Flash (A Fortnightly Edition Published by The Royal Welch Fusiliers), 10 December 1945, Front Page</ref> Miller's entire family had been killed at the [[Jungfernhof Camp]] in [[Riga]], Latvia in March 1942.\n\n== Nuremberg trials ==\n[[File:Arthur Seyss-Inquart N\u00fcrnberg.jpg|thumb|left|Seyss-Inquart (seated) talking to [[Wilhelm Frick]] at the Nuremberg trials.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Inquart.png|thumb|Seyss-Inquart's body after his execution.]] -->\nAt the [[Nuremberg trials]], Seyss-Inquart was defended by Gustav Steinbauer and faced four charges: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity. During the trial, [[Gustave Gilbert]], an American army psychologist, was allowed to examine the Nazi leaders who were tried at Nuremberg for war crimes. Among other tests, a German version of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|Wechsler-Bellevue]] [[IQ test]] was administered. Arthur Seyss-Inquart scored 141, the second highest among the defendants, behind [[Hjalmar Schacht]].\n\nIn his final statement, Seyss-Inquart denied knowledge of various war crimes including the shooting of hostages, and said that while he had moral objections to the deportation of Jews, there must sometimes be justifications for mass evacuations, and pointed to the Allies forcibly resettling millions of Germans after the war. He added that his \"conscience was untroubled\" as he improved the conditions of the Dutch people while [[Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood|Commissioner]]. Seyss-Inquart concluded by saying, \"My last word is the principle by which I have always acted and to which I will adhere to my last breath: I believe in Germany.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.go2war2.nl/artikel/4571/Final-statement-Arthur-Seyss-Inquart.htm|title=Final statement Arthur Seyss-Inquart|website=Go2War2.nl |publisher=[[STIWOT]] |language=nl|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeyss-Inquart was acquitted of conspiracy, but convicted on all other counts and sentenced to death by hanging. The final judgment against him cited his involvement in harsh suppression of Nazi opponents and atrocities against the Jews during all his billets, but particularly stressed his reign of terror in the Netherlands. It was these atrocities that sent him to the gallows.\n\nUpon hearing of his death sentence, Seyss-Inquart was fatalistic: \"Death by hanging... well, in view of the whole situation, I never expected anything different. It's all right.\"<ref>[[G. M. Gilbert]], ''Nuremberg Diary'' (1947), Farrar Straus, page 433.</ref>\n\nBefore his execution, Seyss-Inquart returned to the [[Catholic church]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} receiving absolution in the sacrament of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] from [[prison chaplain]] Father Bruno Spitzl.\n\nHe was hanged in Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. He was the last to mount the scaffold, and his [[last words]] were the following: \"I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany.\"\n\nHis body, with those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann G\u00f6ring, was cremated at the [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]] in [[Munich]], and their ashes were scattered into the river [[Isar]].<ref>{{citation\n  |title=Ein Gl\u00fccksfall der Geschichte\n  |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39916258.html\n  |author=Thomas Darnst\u00e4dt\n  |work=[[Der Spiegel]]\n  |year=2005\n  |volume=14\n  |issue=14\n  |series=13 September\n  |pages=128\n  |quote=\n  |language=German\n}}</ref>{{sfn|Manvell|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}}\n{{-}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn [[Doris Orgel]]'s children's novel, ''The Devil in Vienna'', he is the father of Lise, the only [[Gentile]] friend of its Jewish character Inge Dournenvald, and his only daughter, second born after his son, Heinz.
