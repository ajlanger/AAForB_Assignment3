He also hosted the hit series ''Strictly Come Dancing'', as well as many seasons of his own talk show, ''Pulse'', for the largest commercial network [[RTL Television]].\n\nIn 2001, Oerlemans founded his own production company, Eyeworks.

He presented a wide variety of entertainment shows including the first season of ''American Idol'', which achieved the highest ratings on a commercial channel ever. His later work includes the presentation of ''Strictly Come Dancing'' and his own talk show ''Pulse''.\n\nIn 2001, Oerlemans founded his own production company, Eyeworks, with partners Robert van den Bogaard and Ronald van Wechem. He became one of the industry's most successful producers and directors of global unscripted and scripted content. Titles produced by the Eyeworks Group include: ''[[Test The Nation]]'', ''CQC'', ''Who Wants to Marry my Son?'', ''[[Beat The Blondes]]'', ''Reality Queens of the Jungle'', ''I Know What You Did Last Friday'', ''Obese'' (aka ''Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition''), and ''Celebrity Splash''.\n\nOerlemans\u2019 creation of the format ''Test The Nation'', broadcast in over 50 countries, greatly contributed to the company's acclaim.\n\nIn 2004, Oerlemans won the Zilveren Televizierster, a national prize for the male television personality of the year.

In 2011 he brought the Dutch 3D movie to theatres: ''Nova Zembla'' (starring supermodel Doutzen Kroes in her first on screen appearance), which sold close to a million tickets in the [[Benelux]].\n\nHis love for drama turned him into an active, award-winning producer in the scripted space &mdash; producing numerous feature films, including: ''The Dinner'' (with director [[Menno Meyjes]], writer of ''[[The Color Purple]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''), ''[[New Kids Turbo]]'' (over 1.5 million tickets sold in Holland, Germany and Belgium), and ''[[Jackie (2012 film)|Jackie]]'' (featuring Oscar-winning actress [[Holly Hunter]]).\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n|-\n!
