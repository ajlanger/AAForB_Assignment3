In 2011, [[Relient K]] covered the show's theme song for [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]]\n\n==History==\nThe program, created by [[David Rudman]], his brother Adam and Todd Hannert, under their [[Spiffy Pictures]] banner, began airing in Canada on November 3, 2007, and in the USA a week later. \n \nUK viewers got a premiere of the program on January 13, 2008 on the Playhouse Disney channel sublet of pay-broadcaster [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]].  In France, the series began on January 27, 2008, and kept its original title ''Bunnytown''. The show was produced at [[Ontario, Canada]] with many of the \"Peopletown\" segment exterior scenes done at Clarence Park and Verulamium Park in [[St Albans]]. It is rated [[TV-Y]] in the USA and C in Canada as per their respective countries.\n\n==Format==\nThe basic format features between ten and twelve segments as follows:\n*A [[ski race]], played out in four parts such as kids getting ready to race while Max Mekker, Alfa and Bjarne Betjent, but instead [[ballet]] dancing in the first part, then sleeping in the second part, followed by flying in the third part, and then finally racing in the last part, with the payoff that a rubber band is at the finish line, and they fly back to the starting point.\n*Red and Fred, a silent comedy-slapstick pratfall team in Peopletown made up of a fat ginger haired man and a smaller, thin dark haired male, played by Ed Gaughan and Andrew Buckley.  This is done in the vein of [[Laurel and Hardy]], who have the same style as Red and Fred. On the US broadcast they are known as \"Two Best Friends\".\n*The Adventures of Super-Bunny, created new for Bunnytown follows the format of Little Bad Bunny stealing carrots from Bunnytown, and Super-Bunny comes to the rescue.\n*The Bunnytown Hop, done by a rock-and-roll band inspired by mega groups such as [[Earth Wind and Fire]].\n*Super Silly Sports, also held in Peopletown, hosted by Pinky Pinkerton (portrayed by Scottish actress [[Polly Frame]]), best known for her wearing a pink [[Alice band]] in her blonde [[bouffant]] hairdo along with a matching neck [[scarf]] and [[sportsjacket]] over a white tennis dress, along with pink and white-striped above-the-knee socks. An example of this spoofing of sports contests and their telecasts within is a staring contest between an 11-year-old boy and an Idaho potato (because both of them have \"eyes\").  Pinky's signature exclamation is \"Oh me, oh my!\" done multiple times.\n*Following the payoff of the running gag, all of the bunnies gather to sing the closing song \"It's A Bunnytown Life\".\n* Currently the Bunnytown segments, Two Best Friends (Red and Fred) and Super Silly Sports are being shown in bumper segments on Disney Junior and Disney Junior Night Light.\n\n==Puppets, characters and sets==\nThe bunny [[rod puppets]] (which take up to eight puppeteers to operate with a trigger at the bottom to move their mouths and invisible [[marionette]] strings to work from above on all other parts) are made from foam rubber and covered in fake fur.\n\nCharacters include the many types of characters found in pop culture and storybooks. Included are a king and his court (supposedly the leaders of Bunnytown as they live in a castle), pirates, a superhero bunny, a female bunny who is an astronaut, two cave bunnies and their pet [[dinosaur]], an inventor, a farmer and his helpers and many more.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n |background=#2299FF\n |overall=\n |title=\n |segment=\n |airdate=\n |airdateR=<ref>{{cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/bunnytown-season-1/id266203436|title = Bunnytown \u2013 Episode list<!-- NOTE: air dates can only be seen on iTunes application --> |publisher = iTunes |access-date = 2015-07-18}}</ref>\n |prodcode=\n |prodcodeR=<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First |title=Public Catalog - Copyright Catalog (1978 to present) - Basic Search [search: \"Bunnytown\"] |publisher=United States Copyright Office |access-date=}}</ref>\n |viewers=\n |country=US\n |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = Hello Bunnies!\n|Segment = Running Gag: Runners - The Runners are dancing<hr>Song: Makin' Music in Bunnytown<hr>Running Gag: Runners - The Runners are sleeping<hr>Running Gag: Runners - The Runners are flying<hr>Running Gag: Runners - The Runners are running\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|10}}\n|ProdCode = 101\n|Viewers = <!-- Unknown -->\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Bunny Funnies!\n|Segment = Running Gag: Artistic Bunny painting an apple - A worm going inside an apple as a spaceship Running Gag: Artistic Bunny painting an apple - A Fruit Dancing Bunny<hr>The Adventures of Super-Bunny: Bunnytown Carrot Festival<hr>Running Gag: Artistic Bunny painting an apple -  \n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|11}}\n|ProdCode = 102\n|Viewers = <!-- Unknown -->\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 3\n|Title = Bunny Giggles!\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|17}}\n|ProdCode = 103\n|Viewers = <!-- Unknown -->\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 4\n|Title = Barrel Full of Bunnies!\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|18}}\n|ProdCode = 104\n|Viewers = <!-- Unknown -->\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 5\n|Title = Bunny Shenanigans!\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|24}}\n|ProdCode = 105\n|Viewers = <!-- Unknown -->\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 6\n|Title = Wintertime In Bunnytown!<!-- Don't change from \"Bunnytown\" to \"Bunntyown\".
