Around the St. Nicholas church ([[Bogdana Monastery]]), archaeologists have uncovered a [[Archaeological stratigraphy|habitation layer]] preceding Bogdan's period of rule, one which could point to the existence of a local center prior to the [[foundation of Moldavia]].\n\nAwarded the [[Town privileges|privilege]] of organizing [[fair]]s, R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi evolved due to its favorable location midway between the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the tableland area (with traders from both regions establishing contact in the local market).

Persecutions became widespread around 1938, when Jews were harassed and attacked by authorities under the [[Octavian Goga]] government; they were confirmed by anti-Semitic legislation passed by the [[Ion Gigurtu]] cabinet, and, in late 1940, exceptionally violent following the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]].

Around the St. Nicholas church ([[Bogdana Monastery]]), archaeologists have uncovered a [[Archaeological stratigraphy|habitation layer]] preceding Bogdan's period of rule, one which could point to the existence of a local center prior to the [[foundation of Moldavia]].\n\nAwarded the [[Town privileges|privilege]] of organizing [[fair]]s, R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi evolved due to its favorable location midway between the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the tableland area (with traders from both regions establishing contact in the local market). The fairs at R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi have been dated to the time of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (a document from 1481; however, since the mention includes details of Stephen's intervention in solving a commercial dispute, it is possible that the fairs were well established by then).\n\nR\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi has a cathedral (built 1402) with the tombs of several Moldavian princes.<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Radautz |volume=22 |page=783}}</ref> R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi was also the seat of a Greek bishopric, moved to [[Chernivtsi]] in 1786.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nR\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi was one of the largest cities of the Duchy of [[Bukovina]] during the period of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] administration (1775\u20131918).

The community was allowed a degree of self-administration, and witnessed a period of prosperity and cultural effervescence during the 19th century.\n\nThe majority of R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi's Jewish population was exterminated during the [[Holocaust]]. Persecutions became widespread around 1938, when Jews were harassed and attacked by authorities under the [[Octavian Goga]] government; they were confirmed by anti-Semitic legislation passed by the [[Ion Gigurtu]] cabinet, and, in late 1940, exceptionally violent following the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]]. In October 1941, all Jews present in R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi (more than 10,000) were deported to [[concentration camp]]s in [[Transnistria]].<ref name=\"JEWISH_RADAUTI\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_romania/rom2_00516.html | title = Translation of ''R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi'' chapter from ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Communities in Romania'', Vol. 2 | year = 1980 | accessdate = January 29, 2013 | publisher = Yad Vashem, Jerusalim }}</ref>\n\n==Bogdana Monastery==\nThe Princely Church at R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i contained the graves of [[Bogdan I]] and his son [[La\u0163cu]], both [[Voivode]]s/[[Prince]]s of [[Moldavia]], as well as a later ruler, [[Roman I of Moldavia]].
