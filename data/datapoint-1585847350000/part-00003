The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u20131999===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Williams College]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a [[lawn ornament]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] that is no longer in business.

That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label.

Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single, \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, [[The Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000.

According to Porter, \"It\u2019s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn\u2019t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down. Overall it\u2019s not as brash or guitar-heavy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/130729-out-of-the-shadows-into-the-light-an-interview-with-jody-porter-2496141124.html|title=Out of the Shadows, Into the Light: An Interview with Jody Porter|author=Souleo|magazine=Popmatters|date=2010-09-14|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the band released ''[[Sky Full of Holes]]'', an album put out in Japan by [[Warner Music Japan]] (with two bonus tracks), Europe by [[Lojinx]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojinx.com/releases/fountains-of-wayne/sky-full-of-holes |title=Lojinx // Fountains of Wayne / Sky Full of Holes album |publisher=Lojinx.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> and the U.S. by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, \"The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we've ever done. I think I'm partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end. We'll see what happens if we end up making another record.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottsmerc.com/arts_and_entertainment/fountains-of-wayne-performs-songs-from-newest-release-at-sellersville/article_d07ddcbc-6d81-5ad1-9140-13b5e2474459.html|title=Fountains of Wayne performs songs from newest release at Sellersville|first=David|last=Kleinman|publisher=The Mercury|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fountains-of-Wayne-acoustic-July-09.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The band playing [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] in July 2009]]\n\n==Future plans==\nThe band has no plans to record new material. Neither Schlesinger nor Collingwood had ruled out a future reunion, but both saw the possibility as remote. \"I try never to say never,\" Collingwood has said, \"but it\u2019s staggering to think of everything that would have to happen for me to want to repeat that experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambeth, Sam|url=http://louderthanwar.com/interview-fountains-wayne/|title=Interview: Fountains of Wayne|publisher=Louder Than War|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=2016-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Collingwood elaborated on the band's demise by saying, \"When we were recording the record before the last Fountains of Wayne record, which was called ''Traffic and Weather'', I didn't really have a whole lot to contribute to that album. I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over. And when I was ready to actually make another album, you know, several years later after I'd sort of cleaned up my act, it was very difficult. It was very, very hard to get back into the position where we were equals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/24/487237229/fountains-of-wayne-s-chris-collingwood-returns-with-new-project-look-park|title=Fountains of Wayne's Chris Collingwood Returns With New Project 'Look Park'|first=Elise|last=Hu|publisher=NPR|date=2016-07-24|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nPorter and Young joined Schlesinger in 2016 on [[The Monkees]] album ''[[Good Times!]]'', and again in 2018 on the group's [[Christmas Party (The Monkees album)|''Christmas Party'']].

Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single, \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, [[The Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000. The show was cancelled and Collingwood was taken to an emergency department,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theywillrockyou.com/2007/06/fountains-of-wayne/|title=Fountains of Wayne|first=Lexi|last=Shapiro|publisher=They Will Rock You|date=2007-06-26|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> followed by recovery in a mental hospital after returning to the US.<ref name=Myers>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/08/fountains-of-wayne.html|title=Fountains of Wayne: Ironic No More|first=Paul|last=Myers|magazine=Paste|date=2011-08-03|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the band released ''[[Traffic and Weather]]'', an album which included the song \"I-95\", which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named #54 of the year's top 100 songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/rolling-stone-top-songs-2008/16472/ |title=Rolling Stone slights Rihanna and embraces Newman on 2007 singles &#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref> Collingwood had less involvement during the making of the album due to his struggles with depression and alcoholism, only managing to contribute three songs.<ref name=Myers/>\n\nIn 2008, Porter released his debut solo album ''Close to the Sun'', a collection of songs he had written and recorded over a period of years in between Fountains of Wayne albums and tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fountains-of-wayne-1329689|title=Fountains of Wayne guitarist for solo career|publisher=NME|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the band released ''No Better Place: Live In Chicago'', a live concert DVD which included newly recorded acoustic songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.amazon.com/Fountains-Wayne-Better-Place-Chicago/dp/B001PPLKJ4 |title=Fountains of Wayne: No Better Place - Live in Chicago: Chris Collingwood, Steven M.

According to Porter, \"It\u2019s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn\u2019t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down. Overall it\u2019s not as brash or guitar-heavy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/130729-out-of-the-shadows-into-the-light-an-interview-with-jody-porter-2496141124.html|title=Out of the Shadows, Into the Light: An Interview with Jody Porter|author=Souleo|magazine=Popmatters|date=2010-09-14|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the band released ''[[Sky Full of Holes]]'', an album put out in Japan by [[Warner Music Japan]] (with two bonus tracks), Europe by [[Lojinx]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojinx.com/releases/fountains-of-wayne/sky-full-of-holes |title=Lojinx // Fountains of Wayne / Sky Full of Holes album |publisher=Lojinx.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> and the U.S. by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, \"The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we've ever done. I think I'm partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end. We'll see what happens if we end up making another record.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottsmerc.com/arts_and_entertainment/fountains-of-wayne-performs-songs-from-newest-release-at-sellersville/article_d07ddcbc-6d81-5ad1-9140-13b5e2474459.html|title=Fountains of Wayne performs songs from newest release at Sellersville|first=David|last=Kleinman|publisher=The Mercury|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fountains-of-Wayne-acoustic-July-09.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The band playing [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] in July 2009]]\n\n==Future plans==\nThe band has no plans to record new material. Neither Schlesinger nor Collingwood had ruled out a future reunion, but both saw the possibility as remote. \"I try never to say never,\" Collingwood has said, \"but it\u2019s staggering to think of everything that would have to happen for me to want to repeat that experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambeth, Sam|url=http://louderthanwar.com/interview-fountains-wayne/|title=Interview: Fountains of Wayne|publisher=Louder Than War|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=2016-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Collingwood elaborated on the band's demise by saying, \"When we were recording the record before the last Fountains of Wayne record, which was called ''Traffic and Weather'', I didn't really have a whole lot to contribute to that album. I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over. And when I was ready to actually make another album, you know, several years later after I'd sort of cleaned up my act, it was very difficult. It was very, very hard to get back into the position where we were equals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/24/487237229/fountains-of-wayne-s-chris-collingwood-returns-with-new-project-look-park|title=Fountains of Wayne's Chris Collingwood Returns With New Project 'Look Park'|first=Elise|last=Hu|publisher=NPR|date=2016-07-24|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nPorter and Young joined Schlesinger in 2016 on [[The Monkees]] album ''[[Good Times!]]'', and again in 2018 on the group's [[Christmas Party (The Monkees album)|''Christmas Party'']].
