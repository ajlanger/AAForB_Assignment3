typically in the middle (even) year between [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]]. The Games are for countries in [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Mexico]], and the [[South America|South American Caribbean countries]]  of [[Colombia]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Venezuela]].\n\nThe Games are overseen by the [[CACSO|Central American and Caribbean Sports Organization]] (CACSO) (the organization also goes by the acronym \"ODECABE\", from its full Spanish name: '''''O'''rganizaci\u00f3n '''De'''portiva '''C'''entro'''a'''mericana y del Cari'''be''''').<ref>{{in lang|es}} [https://archive.is/20120909024120/http://www.odecabe.org/ ODECABE website] www.odecabe.org; retrieved 2010-03-03</ref> They are designed to provide a step between sub-CACG-region Games held the first year following a Summer Olympics (e.g. Central American Games) and the Continental Championships, the [[Pan American Games]], held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]].\n\n[[2018 Central American and Caribbean Games|The last games]] were held in [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]] between 19 July to 3 August. The next games will be held in 2022, between 22 April~8 May in multiple venues in [[Panama]].\n\n== History ==\nThe CACGs are the oldest continuing regional games in the world,<ref>[http://www.cacso.org/history.php History of CACSO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725224511/http://www.cacso.org/history.php |date=July 25, 2009 }} from the CACSO website (www.cacso.org); retrieved 2009-06-26.  </ref> and only the Olympics have run longer. [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Guatemala]] were the three countries present at the first games, which were then called the ''Central American Games''. In 1935 their name was changed to ''Central American and Caribbean Games'' to reflect expanding participation. \n\nA \"Central American Games\" does exist today, Juegos Centroamericanos, involving
