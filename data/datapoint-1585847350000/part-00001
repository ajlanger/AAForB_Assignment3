Richter also notes that Cahokia's advanced development coincided with the development in the Southwest of the [[Chaco Canyon]] society, which also produced large-scale works in an apparent socially stratified society. The decline of the city coincides with the [[Little Ice Age]], although by then, the three-fold agriculture remained well-established throughout temperate North America.<ref>{{cite book | title=Before the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts | publisher=Belknap - Harvard University Press | author=Richter, Daniel K. | year=2011 | location=Cambridge, MA | pages=20\u201321 | isbn=9780674055803}}</ref>\n\n===Rise and peak (13th century)===\nCahokia became the most important center for the people known today as [[Mississippian culture|Mississippians]]. Their settlements ranged across what is now the [[Midwest]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and Southeastern United States. Cahokia was located in a strategic position near the confluence of the Mississippi, [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] Rivers. It maintained trade links with communities as far away as the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Gulf Coast]] to the south, trading in such exotic items as copper, [[Mill Creek chert]],<ref name=ILLINOISAGRI>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/agriculture/htmls/technology/hand_tools/tech_hand_na.html |title=Illinois Agriculture-Technology-Hand tools-Native American Tools |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> and [[whelk]] shells.\n[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|Artists recreation of central Cahokia.

Cahokia's control of the manufacture and distribution of these hand tools was an important economic activity that allowed the city to thrive.<ref name=SNOW2010 /> [[Mississippian culture pottery]] and stone tools in the Cahokian style were found at the Silvernale site<ref>[https://cannonvalleytrail.com/cultural/  Cannon Valley Trail]</ref> near [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], and materials and trade goods from Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast and Lake Superior have been excavated at Cahokia.

Although it was home to only about 1,000 people before ''circa'' 1050, its population grew rapidly after that date. According to a 2007 study in ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', \"Between AD 1050 and 1100, Cahokia's population increased from between 1,400 and 2,800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people\".<ref>Benson LV, Berry MS, Jolie EA, Spangler JD, Stahle DW, Hattori EM. \"Possible impacts of early-11th-, middle-12th-, and late-13th-century droughts on western Native Americans and the Mississippian Cahokians.\" ''Quaternary Science Reviews'' 2007, 26:336\u2013350,</ref> an estimate that applies only to a {{convert|1.8|km2|adj=on}} high density central occupation area.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = L.

A related problem was waste disposal for the dense population, and Cahokia became unhealthy from polluted waterways.

There is no other evidence for warfare, so the [[palisade]] may have been more for ritual or formal separation than for military purposes. Diseases transmitted among the large, dense urban population are another possible cause of decline. Many theories since the late 20th century propose conquest-induced political collapse as the primary reason for Cahokia's abandonment.<ref>Emerson 1997, [[Timothy Pauketat|Pauketat]] 1994.</ref>\n\nTogether with these factors, researchers found evidence in 2015 of major floods at Cahokia, so severe as to flood dwelling places.

Separated into four types, each from a different geographical region, the arrowheads demonstrated Cahokia's extensive trade links in North America.\n\nArcheologists recovered more than 250 other skeletons from Mound 72. Scholars believe almost 62% of these were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors.<ref>Young & Fowler, p. 148.</ref>  The skeletons include:\n* Four young males, missing their hands and skulls\n* A mass grave of more than 50 women around 21 years old, with the bodies arranged in two layers separated by matting\n* A mass burial containing 40 men and women who appear to have been violently killed, some of these may have been buried alive: \"From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred \u2013 that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.\"<ref>Young & Fowler, pp. 146\u2013149.</ref>\n\nThe relationship of these burials to the central burial is unclear. They were unlikely to have all deposited at the same time. Wood in several parts of the mound has been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to between 950 and 1000&nbsp;CE.\n\nExcavations have indicated that Mound 72 was not constructed as a single mound, but rather as a series of smaller mounds. These mounds were reshaped and covered over to give Mound 72 its final ridge-top shape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/72/|title=Mound 72|publisher=Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site|accessdate=2012-03-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623230142/http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/72|archivedate=June 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Copper workshop===\n{{main|Mound 34}}\n\n[[File:Spiro Wulfing and Etowah repousse plates HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|Mississippian culture ''repouss\u00e9 ''copper plates]]\n\nExcavations near [[Mound 34]] from 2002 to 2010 revealed a copper workshop.

Later designation as a state historic site offered additional protection, but the site came under significant threat from the federal highway building program in the 1950s. The highway program reduced the site's integrity; however, it increased funding for emergency archeological investigations. These investigations became intensive, and today continue, and have led to the present understanding of the significance of the site.

The mounds were later named after the [[Cahokia tribe]], a historic [[Illiniwek]] people living in the area when the first French explorers arrived in the 17th century. As this was centuries after Cahokia was abandoned by its original inhabitants, the Cahokia tribe was not necessarily descended from the earlier Mississippian-era people.

Richter|Daniel Richter]] notes that the apex of the city occurred during the [[Medieval Warming Period]]. This period appears to have fostered an agricultural revolution in upper North America, as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three-fold crops]] of [[maize]], beans ([[legumes]]), and gourds ([[Cucurbita|squash]]) were developed and adapted or bred to the temperate climates of the north from their origins in [[Mesoamerica]]. Richter also notes that Cahokia's advanced development coincided with the development in the Southwest of the [[Chaco Canyon]] society, which also produced large-scale works in an apparent socially stratified society. The decline of the city coincides with the [[Little Ice Age]], although by then, the three-fold agriculture remained well-established throughout temperate North America.<ref>{{cite book | title=Before the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts | publisher=Belknap - Harvard University Press | author=Richter, Daniel K. | year=2011 | location=Cambridge, MA | pages=20\u201321 | isbn=9780674055803}}</ref>\n\n===Rise and peak (13th century)===\nCahokia became the most important center for the people known today as [[Mississippian culture|Mississippians]]. Their settlements ranged across what is now the [[Midwest]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and Southeastern United States. Cahokia was located in a strategic position near the confluence of the Mississippi, [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] Rivers. It maintained trade links with communities as far away as the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Gulf Coast]] to the south, trading in such exotic items as copper, [[Mill Creek chert]],<ref name=ILLINOISAGRI>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/agriculture/htmls/technology/hand_tools/tech_hand_na.html |title=Illinois Agriculture-Technology-Hand tools-Native American Tools |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> and [[whelk]] shells.\n[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|Artists recreation of central Cahokia. Cahokia's east-west [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] transects the Woodhenge, Monk's Mound, and several other large mounds]]\nMill Creek chert, most notably, was used in the production of hoes, a high demand tool for farmers around Cahokia and other Mississippian centers. Cahokia's control of the manufacture and distribution of these hand tools was an important economic activity that allowed the city to thrive.<ref name=SNOW2010 /> [[Mississippian culture pottery]] and stone tools in the Cahokian style were found at the Silvernale site<ref>[https://cannonvalleytrail.com/cultural/  Cannon Valley Trail]</ref> near [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], and materials and trade goods from Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast and Lake Superior have been excavated at Cahokia. Bartering, not money, was used in trade.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/march/12/cahokia.htm</ref>\n\nAt the high point of its development, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great [[Mesoamerica]]n cities in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. Although it was home to only about 1,000 people before ''circa'' 1050, its population grew rapidly after that date. According to a 2007 study in ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', \"Between AD 1050 and 1100, Cahokia's population increased from between 1,400 and 2,800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people\".<ref>Benson LV, Berry MS, Jolie EA, Spangler JD, Stahle DW, Hattori EM. \"Possible impacts of early-11th-, middle-12th-, and late-13th-century droughts on western Native Americans and the Mississippian Cahokians.\" ''Quaternary Science Reviews'' 2007, 26:336\u2013350,</ref> an estimate that applies only to a {{convert|1.8|km2|adj=on}} high density central occupation area.<ref>Benson, L.

A related problem was waste disposal for the dense population, and Cahokia became unhealthy from polluted waterways. Because it was such an unhealthy place to live, Snow believes that the town had to rely on social and political attractions to bring in a steady supply of new immigrants; otherwise, the town's death rate would have caused it to be abandoned earlier.<ref name=SNOW2010/>\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Mississippian culture mound components HRoe 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A mound diagram of the Mississippian culture|Mississippian period showing the multiple layers of mound construction, mound structures such as temples or mortuaries, ramps with log stairs, and prior structures under later layers, multiple terraces, and intrusive burials]]\nThe population of Cahokia began to decline during the 13th century, and the site was eventually abandoned around 1300.<ref name=\"reader\">Henderson, Harold. \"[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-mound-people/Content?oid=902673 The Rise and Fall of the Mound People]\".

There is no other evidence for warfare, so the [[palisade]] may have been more for ritual or formal separation than for military purposes. Diseases transmitted among the large, dense urban population are another possible cause of decline. Many theories since the late 20th century propose conquest-induced political collapse as the primary reason for Cahokia's abandonment.<ref>Emerson 1997, [[Timothy Pauketat|Pauketat]] 1994.</ref>\n\nTogether with these factors, researchers found evidence in 2015 of major floods at Cahokia, so severe as to flood dwelling places. Analysis of sediment from beneath [[Horseshoe Lake (Madison County, Illinois)|Horseshoe Lake]] has revealed that two major floods occurred in the period of settlement at Cahokia, in roughly 1100\u20131260 and 1340\u20131460.<ref name=\"insight\">[http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/new-insights-curious-disappearance-cahokia-mounds-builders Durrie Bouscaren, \"New insights into the curious disappearance of the Cahokia Mounds builders\"], St. Louis Public Radio, 4 May 2015, accessed 6 May 2015</ref><ref>[http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/spring-2015/article/cahokia-s-rise-and-fall-linked-to-river-flooding \"Cahokia's rise and fall linked to river flooding\"], ''Popular Archaeology'', Spring 2015</ref>\n\n==Notable features==\n\nThe original site contained 120 earthen mounds over an area of {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|0}}, of which 80 remain today.

The causeway itself may have been seen as a symbolic \"Path of Souls\".<ref name=BAIRES/>\n\nThe high-status central district of Cahokia was surrounded by a 2-mi-long palisade that was equipped with protective bastions. A later addition to the site, when the palisade was constructed, it cut through and separated some pre-existing neighborhoods.<ref name=SNOW2010/> Archaeologists found evidence of the stockade during excavation of the area and indications that it was rebuilt several times. Its [[bastions]] showed that it was mainly built for defensive purposes.<ref name=SNOW2010/>\n\nBeyond Monks Mound, as many as 120 more mounds stood at varying distances from the city center. To date, 109 mounds have been located, 68 of which are in the park area. The mounds are divided into three different types: [[platform mound|platform]], [[cone (geometry)|conical]], and [[ridge]]-top. Each appeared to have had its own meaning and function. In general terms, the city center seems to have been laid out in a diamond-shaped pattern about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} from end to end, while the entire city is {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} across from east to west.\n\n===Mound 72===\n{{main|Mound 72}}\n[[File:Cahokia Mound 72.jpg|thumb|Mound 72]]\n\nDuring excavation of Mound 72, a ridge-top [[burial mound]] south of main urban precinct, archaeologists found the remains of a man in his 40s who was probably an important Cahokian ruler. The man was buried on a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a [[falcon]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2001augustmound72excavation1.htm |title=Cahokia and the excavation of Mound 72|accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> with the bird's head appearing beneath and beside the man's head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs.\n\nThe falcon warrior or \"[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|birdman]]\" is a common motif in Mississippian culture. This burial clearly had powerful [[iconography|iconographic]] significance. In addition, a cache of sophisticated, finely worked [[arrow]]heads in a variety of different styles and materials was found near the grave of this important man. Separated into four types, each from a different geographical region, the arrowheads demonstrated Cahokia's extensive trade links in North America.\n\nArcheologists recovered more than 250 other skeletons from Mound 72. Scholars believe almost 62% of these were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors.<ref>Young & Fowler, p. 148.</ref>  The skeletons include:\n* Four young males, missing their hands and skulls\n* A mass grave of more than 50 women around 21 years old, with the bodies arranged in two layers separated by matting\n* A mass burial containing 40 men and women who appear to have been violently killed, some of these may have been buried alive: \"From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred \u2013 that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.\"<ref>Young & Fowler, pp. 146\u2013149.</ref>\n\nThe relationship of these burials to the central burial is unclear. They were unlikely to have all deposited at the same time. Wood in several parts of the mound has been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to between 950 and 1000&nbsp;CE.\n\nExcavations have indicated that Mound 72 was not constructed as a single mound, but rather as a series of smaller mounds.
