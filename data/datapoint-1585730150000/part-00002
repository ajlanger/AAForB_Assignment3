For their first decade, Wrexham mostly played friendly matches against both Welsh and English opposition, with the Welsh Cup providing most of their competitive football, Wrexham winning it again in 1883.\n\n1883 also saw Wrexham's first appearance in the FA Cup, when after receiving a bye to the second round of the competition they were defeated 3\u20134 at home by [[Oswestry Town F.C.|Oswestry]]. Crowd trouble at the game led to the club being expelled from the Football Association, leading to the club being reformed in 1884 as Wrexham Olympic.

Lea played for the club despite only having one arm<ref>{{cite book |title=Who's Who of Welsh International Soccer Players |last1=Davies |first1=Gareth |last2=Garland |first2=Ian |year=1991 |publisher=Bridge Books |isbn=1-872424-11-2|page=125}}</ref> as did playing colleague James Roberts. Wrexham finished the season second from bottom in eighth place in the first season.\n\nWrexham played in the Combination for four years before a rapid increase in costs resulted in the club joining the [[Welsh Senior League|Welsh League]] in the 1894\u201395 season. Wrexham won the Welsh League both years that they were in it, but they then decided to return to the Combination, as despite the reduced support they received, the savings made on their travelling expenses outweighed the reduction in gate revenue.\n\n===1905\u20131960===\n[[File:Wrexham AFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Wrexham in the English football league system]]The club then remained in the Combination league until 1905, by which time they had managed to win the league four times. After several unsuccessful attempts Wrexham were finally elected to the Birmingham and District League in time for the beginning of the 1905\u201306 season. Wrexham's first ever match in this league was at home against [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] at the Racecourse, and two thousand spectators witnessed Wrexham win the match 2\u20131. Wrexham finished sixth in their first season in this league.\n\nDuring their time in the Birmingham and District League, Wrexham won the Welsh Cup six times, in 1908\u201309, 1909\u201310, 1910\u201311, 1913\u201314, 1914\u201315, and 1920\u201321. They also reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup for a second time in the 1908\u201309 season before losing a replay 1\u20132 to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] after extra time.\n\nIn 1921 Wrexham were elected to the newly formed [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] of [[the Football League]]. Their first League game was against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] at the Racecourse in front of 8,000 spectators. Playing in blue shirts, Wrexham were defeated 0\u20132. The week after this defeat Wrexham travelled north to play Hartlepool and managed to get their revenge by beating them 1\u20130 in a hard-earned victory.\n\nIt was during this particular season that Wrexham achieved many \"firsts\" in the club's history, such as when Ted Regan scored the club's first ever [[hat-trick]], and also Brian Simpson became the first Wrexham player to be sent off in a League game when he was ordered from the field of play against [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in January 1922. Charlie Hewitt was the club's first ever manager during this period.\n\nIn the 1926\u201327 season the club got past the first round of the FA Cup only to be knocked out by [[Rhyl F.C.|Rhyl]]. The following season Wrexham fought their way to the fourth round before they lost 0\u20131 to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. A record 32 league goals from Albert Mays helped Wrexham to get to third position in the division in the 1928\u201329 season. And later in that season [[Tommy Bamford]] made his first appearance for the club. He went on to score 201 League and Cup goals for the club during his time at the Racecourse. During the 1929\u201330 season the club recorded their best ever league win to date when they defeated [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] 8\u20130.\n\nWrexham enjoyed their best ever Third Division North season in 1932\u201333, when they finished runners-up to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and won 18 of their 21 home games during the course of the season. This was the first season that the club appeared in their now-familiar red and white strip for the first time for the short-lived 1939\u201340 season.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] years, when long cross-county trips were impossible due to the war, Wrexham played in the ''Regional League West'' against local teams from [[Merseyside]] and [[Manchester]], amongst others in the north west region. Wrexham's position as a barracks town meant that the team could secure the services of many famous guest players such as [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Stan Cullis]].\n\nIn the first post-war season Wrexham equalled their best ever position when they again finished third in the Third Division North. In the summer of 1949 the club made its first ever tour abroad when it played three games against the British army in Germany.\n\nThe club reached the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1956\u201357 where they played [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Busby Babes]] in front of a crowd of 34,445 people at the Racecourse, which still remains a club record. The 5\u20130 defeat did not spoil the occasion for the large home crowd, and later that season Wrexham managed to win the Welsh Cup for the first time in 26 years.\n\n===1960\u20131970===\n1960 saw the club were relegated for the first time in their history, and they dropped into the newly created Fourth Division. But their performances did improve following the appointment of [[Ken Barnes (footballer)|Ken Barnes]] as player-manager. He led Wrexham straight back to promotion to the third division in his first season in charge and oversaw the 10\u20131 trouncing of [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], which is still the club's record league victory. Two years after their promotion, Wrexham were relegated to the Fourth Division again, and in 1966 they finished rock-bottom at 92nd in the Football League after an extremely disappointing season.\n\n===1970\u20131982===\nWith Welsh clubs now able to qualify for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] by winning the Welsh Cup, Wrexham played their inaugural match in Europe against Swiss side [[FC Zurich]] in Switzerland on 13 September 1972, the game finishing 1\u20131. In the return leg Wrexham won 2\u20131, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20132 win on aggregate. The second round drew Wrexham against Yugoslav side [[Hajduk Split]]. Over the course of two games the score finished 3\u20133 on aggregate with Wrexham matching their more illustrious opponents, but they were knocked out of the competition due to the [[away goals rule]].\n\nThe 1972\u201373 season saw the completion of the new Yale stand, with the ability to hold a capacity of up to 5,500, including the terrace helped to comprise the bottom tier of the stand.\n\nThe 1973\u201374 season saw Wrexham change their badge from the [[Maelor]] crest to a brand new badge that had a lot more resemblance to the Welsh roots of the club, with three feathers on the top of the badge and two dragons, one on either side of the badge and facing inwards. This is still the present badge for today's team. This season also saw Wrexham reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in another cup run. After victories over [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and Southampton, their cup run finally came to end against first division side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]], with just over 20,000 Wrexham fans present to watch the match. Also that season Wrexham just missed out on the promotion spots, finishing in 4th place at the end of the season.\n\n1975\u201376 saw [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]]'s starlets captained by Eddie May, again shocked the football world by reaching the quarter finals of the European cup-winners cup after another sparkling cup run and multiple defeats of higher quality opponents. In the first round Wrexham beat Swedish team [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]] 3\u20132 on aggregate. They then managed to knock out Polish side [[Stal Rzeszow]] 3\u20131 on aggregate. Wrexham played Belgian champions [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in the quarter finals and narrowly lost 2\u20131 to the eventual winners of the competition.\n\nThe 1976\u201377 season saw Wrexham again beat First Division opposition in both Cup competitions as they went on another cup run, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the Football League Cup and Sunderland in the FA Cup, however the league season was a traumatic one as the club, on the verge of promotion to the second division with only four matches left to play, required just three points to reach their goal, and unbelievably they missed out after a poor run of form.\n\n[[Arfon Griffiths]] took over as player-manager for the 1977\u201378 season. They reached both the League and FA Cup quarter-finals that season, and Wrexham finally clinched promotion to the second division when they beat Rotherham United 7\u20131 at a packed Racecourse, and Wrexham went on to win the Third Division Championship that year.\n\nIn the 1978\u201379 season Wrexham made it to the fourth round of the FA Cup where they narrowly lost to Tottenham Hotspur 3\u20132 in the replay after the first game finished 3\u20133, the Spurs team had stars amongst their ranks such as [[Ossie Ardiles]], [[Ricky Villa]] and [[Glenn Hoddle]] in their team, and Wrexham were unfortunate to get knocked out.\n\nFollowing Arfon Griffiths resignation from the manager's position in 1981, his assistant [[Mel Sutton]] was put in charge, with the memorable third round FA Cup win over Brian Clough's [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in another cup run, the highlight of the season.\n\n===1982\u20131992===\nThe summer of 1982 saw [[Bobby Roberts (footballer)|Bobby Roberts]] appointed the club's new manager. Relegation meant the club had dire financial problems, resulting in the sale of many of the club's experienced and talented players. Frank Carrdus, [[Ian Edwards (footballer born 1955)|Ian Edwards]], Mick Vinter and Wayne Cegieski had already left during the summer, Steve Fox, [[Joey Jones]], [[Dixie McNeil]] and [[Billy Ronson]] soon followed. Wrexham were again relegated to the Fourth Division after plummeting from apparent mid-table security. The club's slide continued into the following season, and only goal difference prevented Wrexham from being forced to apply for re-election to the League.\n\nThe 1984\u201385 season saw Wrexham take on [[FC Porto]] in European competition. Wrexham won the home leg with a 1\u20130 victory, but in the second leg Porto showed their class and were 3\u20130 up after 38 minutes, however Wrexham pulled goals back and the game finished 4\u20133 with Wrexham advancing on away goals. The second round draw was to pair Wrexham with Italian [[AS Roma]], managed by [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]. Wrexham lost 3\u20130 on aggregate over the two legs. Their league performance was even more dire than the previous year, and by the time Bobby Roberts was finally removed from his post, Wrexham were rock-bottom of the entire Football League.\n\nFormer Racecourse favourite Dixie McNeil was appointed caretaker manager, and immediately inspired a revival that saw Wrexham win 7 of their last 10 matches and comfortably finish clear of having to apply for re-election, which earned him the job on a permanent basis that summer. His first season in charge saw the team finish mid-table position in an average season, he led the team to a Welsh Cup final win over Kidderminster Harriers. 1986 saw Wrexham make a return to European football with a first round draw against Maltese side FC Zurrieq, whom they beat 7\u20130 on aggregate to earn a second round tie against [[Real Zaragoza]] which they drew 2\u20132 with on aggregate but they went out on away-goals.\n\nFollowing the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] in May 1985, legislation on ground safety at all football grounds was brought in effect, this eventually led to the closure of the Mold Road stand because it did not reach the necessary safety standards. Led by Dixie McNeil, Wrexham reached the Fourth Division play-offs in 1989, having finished seventh in the league. Wrexham beat [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the semi-final 5\u20131 on aggregate, but narrowly lost to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] 2\u20131 in the final. After Wrexham started the next season with just 3 wins from 13 league games, Dixie McNeil resigned before his inevitable sacking.\n\nHe was replaced, initially on a temporary basis, by [[Brian Flynn]], but his appointment was made permanent a month later. However the club continued to struggle domestically, and Flynn was forced to make three important signings in Mark Setori, [[Eddie Youds]] and [[Alan Kennedy]] which saw the team finish in twenty-first place, therefore avoiding relegation.\n\nThe 1990\u201391 season it was announced there would be no relegation to the [[Conference Premier]] as a team had already voluntarily left the league. That season Wrexham were to finish in ninety-second place. Wrexham were knocked-out of the European Cup Winners' Cup in the second round by Manchester United 5\u20130 on aggregate, who eventually went on to win the trophy.\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season saw Wrexham still in a poor financial state, as they continued to struggle on the field. With the club knocked out of the League Cup and struggling in the league, it was left to the FA Cup to keep the season alive. Having beaten [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]] and [[Winsford United F.C.|Winsford United]] they were drawn to play the previous season's First Division champions and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Wrexham produced one of their most memorable nights to beat the Gunners 2\u20131 after being behind, with a thunderous [[Mickey Thomas (footballer)|Mickey Thomas]] free kick and a [[Steve Watkin (footballer)|Steve Watkin]] goal. They lost in the next round to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130 in a replay after the first game had finished 2\u20132.\n\n===1993\u20132001===\nIn an attempt to change the fortunes of the club after several seasons in the doldrums at the bottom of the football league pyramid, the 1992\u201393 season saw Wrexham manager Brian Flynn make a shrewd signing when he enlisted the services of Gary Bennett, who soon settled and helped Wrexham into the promotion race. Wrexham's season came to a head on 27 April 1993 when with two games left they travelled to [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] requiring a win to gain promotion to the next tier of the English football. The game ended with a 2\u20130 victory to Wrexham and the 5,500 travelling \"Reds\" supporters there were jubilant when promotion had finally been achieved.\n\nThe 1994\u201395 season would see Wrexham achieve more success in cup competitions, this time going on a run through the FA Cup. Having beaten [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] and Rotherham United, they faced Premier League side [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the Racecourse, with Wrexham running out 2\u20131 winners thanks to goals from [[Gary Bennett (footballer born 1962)|Gary Bennett]] and [[Kieron Durkan]]. In the next round, Wrexham were drawn away to Manchester United and despite taking the lead at [[Old Trafford]], United went on to win 5\u20132.\n\nThe 1995\u201396 season once again saw Wrexham in European action, with their opposition this time coming in the form of Romanian team [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]; the home leg ended in a 0\u20130 draw but Wrexham lost 1\u20130 in the away leg, with the Romanians scoring the only goal of the match, and Wrexham were subsequently knocked out of the tournament.\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season saw Wrexham set off on another amazing run in the FA Cup and beating more top flight opposition. Following wins at [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]] and Scunthorpe United, they were drawn to play West Ham United at home, the game ending in a 1\u20131 draw on a snow-covered pitch after a well earned draw. The replay at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] ended in a shock 1\u20130 win to Wrexham as [[Kevin Russell (footballer)|Kevin Russell]] scored in the dying minutes to send Wrexham into the fourth round.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Ham fear FA censure over pitch invasion |first=Mark |last=Pierson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-west-ham-fear-fa-censure-over-pitch-invasion-1285373.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 January 1997 |accessdate=7 April 2012 }}</ref> After also beating [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and Birmingham City in the following rounds, they played [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in an all-Division-2 FA Cup quarter final, Wrexham narrowly losing to the Spireites 1\u20130.\n\nJune 1997 was the date for the official opening of Colliers Park, which was Wrexham's new training ground and was situated just outside [[Gresford]] on Chester Road. It was built at a cost of \u00a3750,000 and is widely regarded to be one of the best training grounds outside of the top flight. It has been used for training by many visiting teams that play at a higher standard over the years.\n\nThe 1999\u20132000 season saw Wrexham again beat a top-flight team in the FA Cup, this time in the shape of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. The final score of the match was 2\u20131, with the second half goals coming from [[Robin Gibson (footballer)|Robin Gibson]] and [[Darren Ferguson]] after being behind to the Premiership outfit. Wrexham went on to win the [[FAW Premier Cup]] in May 2001.\n\n===2001\u20132008===\n[[File:Ryan Valentine scores.jpg|thumb|5 May 2007: Ryan Valentine scores the goal against Boston that keeps Wrexham in the Football League]] \n[[File:Wrexham 3 Boston 1.jpg|thumb|5 May 2007: Scoreboard showing the final score of game that kept Wrexham in the Football League and condemned Boston United to the Conference]] At the start of the 21st century the club was dogged with many problems off the pitch, including then chairman [[Alex Hamilton (property developer)|Alex Hamilton]], attempting to get the club evicted from the stadium so that he could use and sell it for his own development purposes \u2013 the saga involved the sale of the Racecourse Ground to a separate company owned by Hamilton immediately after he became the club's chairman. In the summer of 2004 Hamilton gave the club a year's notice to quit the ground.<ref>{{cite news|title=Timeline: Crisis at Wrexham FC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4022209.stm|accessdate=4 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe club's fans developed an affinity with the fans of fellow football league club [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], who themselves had managed to successfully depose their chairman and keep control of their stadium after he had sold the ground for development purposes in almost the same circumstances.\n\nOn 3 December 2004 the club was placed in [[Administration (insolvency)|financial administration]] by the High Court in [[Manchester]] as the club owed \u00a32,600,000, including \u00a3800,000 which was owed to the [[Inland Revenue]] in unpaid taxes. Wrexham became the first League club to suffer a ten-point deduction under the new rule for being placed in administration, dropping them from the middle of the League One table to the relegation zone after the point deduction, and subsequently condemned Wrexham to relegation.\n\nDespite their financial troubles, Wrexham went on to win the 2004\u201305 [[Football League Trophy]] by defeating [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] 2\u20130 after extra time, in Wrexham's first appearance at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]]. It was Southend's second consecutive defeat in the Football League Trophy final. The winning goals were scored by [[Juan Ugarte]] and [[Darren Ferguson]] as Wrexham ran out winners in front of over 20,000 Wrexham fans.\n\nWrexham still retained an outside chance of escaping the drop in the 2004\u201305 season following an end-of-season winning streak; however, their faint hopes of staying up were ended with a 2\u20131 home loss to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 3 May 2005. The 10-point deduction proved decisive in determining Wrexham's fate, as the club finished with 43 points compared to 20th-placed [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]' 51 \u2013 a net points tally of 53 after deduction, which had condemned them to relegation.\n\nIn October 2005, Birmingham High Court decided that Alex Hamilton's company CrucialMove had improperly acquired the freehold of the ground and the decision went against him. Hamilton then took this to the Appeal Court in London and it ruled on 14 March 2006 that the stadium must remain in the hands of the club's administrators. On 30 April 2006 the administrators reached an agreement with local car dealer Neville Dickens, subject to agreement by the shareholders and creditors (which was achieved on 30 May), for Dickens to take over control of the club and all its assets. Had the club still been in Administration by 3 June then Wrexham would have automatically been expelled from the League because of their financial situation.\n\n''Wrexham Football Club (2006) Ltd'' is the name of the \"phoenix\" company that took over the assets of the old ''Wrexham Association Football Club Limited'' \u2013 technically, the club is no longer known as ''Wrexham Association Football Club'' due to the takeover of the club by Neville Dickens and Geoff Moss and their associates; this is reflected on new merchandise, although most fans will still refer to it as \"Wrexham AFC\".\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season started well for Wrexham, as they went 8 games unbeaten, with included a 4\u20131 away win against Championship side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and were in the play-off places after the addition of numerous new faces. Unfortunately they were beaten in a shock 5\u20130 defeat at [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] on 13 September 2006, then followed by a 5\u20132 defeat at Stockport County. Both of these teams were struggling at the foot of the table when these defeats happened, and Wrexham never fully recovered from them. This would begin the start of a long relegation battle for Wrexham. [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]] was sacked along with his assistant Kevin Russell on 11 January 2007 with Wrexham in the bottom half of the division and after a poor run of results and was replaced by coach [[Brian Carey]]. Wrexham finished 19th in [[Football League Two]] and on 51 points after an impressive late run of form which saw them win 4 out of their last 5 games, which included defeating local rivals Shrewsbury in the last ever derby match at Gay Meadow. Wrexham's league status was saved on the last day of the season with a vital 3\u20131 victory on 5 May 2007 over [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] at home which sent their opponents down to the [[Conference Premier]]  (they were later demoted to the Conference North) and ensured that Wrexham would stay in the [[Football League]].\n\nExpectations were high for the 2007\u201308 season, as there had been the signings of players such as [[Anthony Williams (footballer)|Anthony Williams]], [[Richard Hope]], [[Michael Proctor (footballer)|Michael Proctor]], [[Silvio Spann]] and [[Eifion Williams]] and a push for promotion was expected by the fans after the disappointment of last season. But the season started badly, with only three wins and 10 points by the middle of November and Wrexham rooted to the bottom of the table.\n\nBrian Carey was eventually sacked after Wrexham crashed out of the FA Cup in the First Round following a 4\u20131 defeat against Peterborough United. On 6 November 2007 Wrexham Football Club released a statement saying that the club were looking for an \"experienced senior manager\" to work alongside the current Racecourse staff. On 15 November 2007, [[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]] was named as Wrexham's new manager and the replacement to Brian Carey, who took the role of assistant manager.\n\nAfter a promising start to his reign, a run of 7 straight league defeats and a 4\u20132 defeat in the FAW Premier Cup at the hands of [[Llanelli A.F.C.|Llanelli]], forced Little to ring the changes and brought in 11 players in the January transfer window to attempt to change Wrexham's fortunes. In terms of the backstage staff, he brought in former Port Vale boss [[Martin Foyle]] as first-team coach and several members of staff were told that they had no future at The Racecourse. With the new players introduced Wrexham went a run of six matches unbeaten, which included victories against promotion candidates [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] and [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] and a 0\u20130 draw against Peterborough United. However, in the final months of the season many of Little's new players had become injured and Wrexham suffered several defeats against fellow strugglers in the league and were also defeated 3\u20130 in a derby match against Shrewsbury Town. Wrexham were finally relegated following a 2\u20130 defeat away at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], ending the club's 87-year stay in the Football League.\n\n===2008\u2013===\nThe 2008\u201309 season started well, with a 5\u20130 home victory against [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]], however a run of poor results followed, with Wrexham being left in the mid-table battle, only four points above the relegation zone and only keeping two clean sheets all season. Following a 3\u20130 home defeat against [[Rushden and Diamonds F.C.|Rushden and Diamonds]], and fans calling for his dismissal, Little left Wrexham by mutual consent. Since then, [[Dean Saunders]] has taken over the management of Wrexham, with his first game against [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] ending in a victory. Wrexham's first full season in the Conference Premier ended in a disappointing 10th place. The following year, 2009\u201310, ended in a similar fashion with Wrexham finishing in 11th position, well off the pace of the promotion battle.\n\nIn March 2011 the ownership of the club became subject to two bids: one from Wrexham Supporters' Trust and another from local businesswoman [[Stephanie Booth]]. Wrexham's MP and AM indicated that they would prefer Wrexham Supporters' Trust to secure the bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supporters-direct.org/news/item.asp?n=12301&cat=sd_eng|title=Welcome \u2013 Supporters Direct|website=Supporters-direct.org|access-date=25 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414211310/http://www.supporters-direct.org/news/item.asp?n=12301&cat=sd_eng|archive-date=14 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A third bid later came in, but after WST and Booth came to an agreement, their bid was then reaccepted.\n\nIn April 2011, the club were served with a winding up order from HMRC, with an unpaid tax bill of just under \u00a3200,000. The team finished the 2010\u201311 season in 4th place, qualifying for a play-off spot.\n\nOn 5 May 2011 Wrexham played their first play-off game against Luton Town at home: Wrexham were 3\u20130 down in the first half and failed to score in the second half.\n[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9475718.stm]\n\nOn 10 May 2011 Wrexham played their second play-off game: Wrexham went 1\u20130 up after Andy Mangan scored in the 8th minute, Gareth Taylor later missed a penalty, Luton went on to win 5\u20131 on aggregate. Over 800 Wrexham fans were present at Kenilworth Road.\n\nDuring the 2011\u201312 season, Wrexham FC were invited back into the [[Welsh Cup]] after 16 years, entering at the third round stage. Their first game was at home to [[Airbus UK Broughton FC|Airbus UK]], but a schedule clash meant that the club were required to play two games on 3 December 2011, one against Airbus, and the other against [[Brentford FC]] in the second round of the FA Cup. Although the scratch side fielded against Airbus lost, the first team fielded against Brentford produced a shock 1\u20130 win. On 4 December Wrexham were drawn away to [[Brighton and Hove Albion FC]] in the third round of the FA Cup in which they drew 1\u20131, with the away sides goal coming from Adrian Cieslewicz. The replay, at the [[Racecourse Ground]] was also 1\u20131, with [[Brighton and Hove Albion FC]] winning 5\u20134 on penalties. Player-Manager [[Andy Morrell]] scored Wrexham's goal.\n\nNew manager Andy Morrell guided Wrexham to a record tally of 98 points but this was not enough to gain automatic promotion, as they ended the season only 5 points adrift of Fleetwood Town, who gained the only automatic place. Wrexham lost in the play-offs to Luton Town again.\n\nWrexham earned themselves places in both the [[2013 FA Trophy Final|FA Trophy final]] and the [[2013 Conference Premier play-off Final|Conference Premier play-off final]], their first two appearances at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the club's 150-year history to date, and within five weeks of one another. In the FA Trophy final Wrexham won on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. A 5\u20132 aggregate win over [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] in the two-legged play-off semi-final saw Wrexham through to the final versus [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], the first play-off final to feature two Welsh teams; Newport defeated Wrexham 2\u20130.\n\nOn 24 February 2014, Andy Morrell stepped down as manager, \"I feel it is in the best interests of both Wrexham FC and me to make a change now,\" Morrell said in a statement. Billy Barr took temporary control of Wrexham Football Club until 20 March 2014 when [[Kevin Wilkin]] was announced as the new First Team Manager, joining from Nuneaton Town on a two and a half year deal. Wrexham finished the 2013\u201314 season in 17th place, the lowest position in the club's 150-year history.\n\n==Seasons==\nStatistics from recent seasons.

FC.jpg|260px|thumb|right|The Kop End and Mold Road Stand (foreground)]]\n\n{{Main|Racecourse Ground}}\n\nThe Racecourse Ground is situated on the Mold Road, which is the main through road heading into Wrexham, it is opposite the residential area of Maesgwyn, situated between [[Glynd\u0175r University]] and [[Wrexham General railway station]]. In August 2011 Glynd\u0175r University purchased the stadium and the club training facilities in [[Gresford]]. Since then, they have added their name to the stadium for it to become The Glynd\u0175r University Racecourse Stadium. Subsequently, in 2016, Wrexham Supporters Trust secured a 99-year lease on the ground, and the name has reverted to the Racecourse Ground. The capacity is 10,500, making it one of the largest stadiums in the National League.\n\n===Stands===\n'''The Kop Stand''': the all-standing home stand, is named after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], as many grounds in the UK used to have ends named similarly. Behind the goal, it is known officially as the Crispin Lane End or \"Town End\". With a capacity of 5,000, the Kop Stand was the largest all-standing terrace in the English Football League but is now no longer in use.\n\n'''BKoncepts Stand''', capacity 4,200, formerly the Yale Stand, this stand is home to the main hospitality area for a match-day called the Bamford Suite, below this suite on ground level is the stadium's social bar area called the Centenary Club. Under this stand you can also find the main ticket office and club shop along with the main staff offices, boardroom, executive room, changing rooms, kit room, and physio room.\n\n'''Tech End''':, capacity 2,800. traditionally the away stand at the Racecourse Ground, since the 2007\u201308 season home fans have been located in this stand and away fans moved to the wing of the BKoncepts Stand, with the exception of games where a large away attendance is anticipated such as the Chester, Tranmere Rovers, and Newport County fixtures. This stand is noted for its excellent acoustics where an excellent atmosphere can be made, however this only happens when Chester turn up, otherwise it is normally quiet. Under this stand now is also Jonesy's Bar which has now been open since the 2016/17 season.\n\n'''Mold Road Stand''':, capacity 3,500. The newest stand, built in 1999 at a cost of \u00a33.5m, which was secured with lottery funding, in time to host the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] pool game between Samoa and Japan, where a crowd of over 14,000 turned up to see a Samoan victory. The stand's unique design is attributed to the Turf Hotel Pub, which is situated on the corner of the stadium. The stand possesses a TV studio and eight fully equipped private boxes, and has a match-day restaurant called \"The 1864 Suite\"; there is also an old programme shop which is run by volunteers adjacent to the stand. A family area was introduced in the 2009\u201310 season, located to the area of the stand nearest to the Kop \u2013 the \"Town End\" and is known as the L&D Brothers Family Stand. Inside the foyer entrance to this stand you can also find a small ticket office which is open for 1 hour prior to kick-off and sells tickets just for that stand to take pressure from the main ticket office under the BKoncepts Stand.\n\n'''Other uses and teams''': The Racecourse Ground has been used by other teams such as [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]] for their qualifying matches in the [[UEFA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. It was the venue for the Champions League encounter between [[The New Saints F.C.|T.N.S.]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2005, watched by a crowd of 8,009, two late goals by [[Steven Gerrard]] sealed a 3\u20130 win for Liverpool. Bangor City played [[FC Midtjylland]] match in 2008, which resulted in a 6\u20131 victory for the [[Denmark|Danish]] team. [[Cefn Druids A.F.C.|Cefn Druids]] played their first ever [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match on the ground in July 2012 \u2013 a scoreless draw with Finnish side [[MYPA|MyPa]].\n\nThe Racecourse Ground is not only used for footballing purposes; as in the past, the [[Scarlets|Llanelli Scarlets]] Rugby Union and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales Rugby Union]] sides have played home games in the historical stadium, as well as the Rugby League side North Wales Crusaders. It has held 4 music concerts since 2016.\n\n==Training ground==\n\nWrexham's training ground was the purpose-built [[Colliers Park, Wrexham|Colliers Park]], in neighbouring [[Gresford]]. When the construction had been completed it was officially opened in June 1997, at a building cost of \u00a3750,000. It is widely regarded in British football as one of the best training grounds outside of the top flight and one of the best never to have been used by a top-flight team. The [[England national football team|England national team]], [[F.C Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]] have all used it for training purposes. Colliers Park continues to be improved, a running hill, as well as all-weather pitches and a small stand have been constructed since the facilities opened in 1997. Colliers Park is now owned by Glyndwr University as part of their purchase of the Racecourse Ground assets.\n\nFor the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season, Wrexham moved back to their former training ground at [[Stansty Park]]. This is also the home of [[Welsh National League (Wrexham Area)|Welsh National League]] side [[Lex XI F.C.|Lex Glyndwr]]. Wrexham did however retain the use of Colliers Park for Youth and Reserve fixtures. After one season training at Stansty Park, Wrexham announced they would be moving to a new training ground at Nine Acre for the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season based near the town centre and are still there at present.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n\n====League====\n\n*'''[[Football League Third Division North]] / [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] / [[Football League

The mascot Wrex the dragon (along with the team nickname \"The Dragons\"), was introduced in 2001\u201302 by the Commercial manager following a ballot of fans to help increase sponsorship and promote the club's Welsh image whilst also providing a more original nickname as [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Swindon Town]] and [[Cheltenham Town]] also use the nickname of 'The Robins'.\n'Wrex' wears a red face and Wrexham F.C. shirt wearing the number \"1864\" on his back; at the time this was thought to have been the year Wrexham F.C. was officially founded, although more recently uncovered evidence suggests the club was actually founded nine years earlier in 1864.\nPrevious mascot Rockin' Robin was also famous for having a wife called Tina Turfit (plus a son, Robinson). A trouble-maker from the moment he was hatched, this rampant robin has left damage and destruction wherever he's gone. The Welsh wildman has set off a fire extinguisher before a game, ridden onto the pitch on a bike and tried to run over a linesman (for which he was sent off by the club's managing director) and dug huge divots from the ground with a pitchfork.

Wrexham finished the season second from bottom in eighth place in the first season.\n\nWrexham played in the Combination for four years before a rapid increase in costs resulted in the club joining the [[Welsh Senior League|Welsh League]] in the 1894\u201395 season. Wrexham won the Welsh League both years that they were in it, but they then decided to return to the Combination, as despite the reduced support they received, the savings made on their travelling expenses outweighed the reduction in gate revenue.\n\n===1905\u20131960===\n[[File:Wrexham AFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Wrexham in the English football league system]]The club then remained in the Combination league until 1905, by which time they had managed to win the league four times. After several unsuccessful attempts Wrexham were finally elected to the Birmingham and District League in time for the beginning of the 1905\u201306 season. Wrexham's first ever match in this league was at home against [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] at the Racecourse, and two thousand spectators witnessed Wrexham win the match 2\u20131. Wrexham finished sixth in their first season in this league.\n\nDuring their time in the Birmingham and District League, Wrexham won the Welsh Cup six times, in 1908\u201309, 1909\u201310, 1910\u201311, 1913\u201314, 1914\u201315, and 1920\u201321. They also reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup for a second time in the 1908\u201309 season before losing a replay 1\u20132 to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] after extra time.\n\nIn 1921 Wrexham were elected to the newly formed [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] of [[the Football League]]. Their first League game was against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] at the Racecourse in front of 8,000 spectators. Playing in blue shirts, Wrexham were defeated 0\u20132. The week after this defeat Wrexham travelled north to play Hartlepool and managed to get their revenge by beating them 1\u20130 in a hard-earned victory.\n\nIt was during this particular season that Wrexham achieved many \"firsts\" in the club's history, such as when Ted Regan scored the club's first ever [[hat-trick]], and also Brian Simpson became the first Wrexham player to be sent off in a League game when he was ordered from the field of play against [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in January 1922. Charlie Hewitt was the club's first ever manager during this period.\n\nIn the 1926\u201327 season the club got past the first round of the FA Cup only to be knocked out by [[Rhyl F.C.|Rhyl]]. The following season Wrexham fought their way to the fourth round before they lost 0\u20131 to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. A record 32 league goals from Albert Mays helped Wrexham to get to third position in the division in the 1928\u201329 season. And later in that season [[Tommy Bamford]] made his first appearance for the club. He went on to score 201 League and Cup goals for the club during his time at the Racecourse. During the 1929\u201330 season the club recorded their best ever league win to date when they defeated [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] 8\u20130.\n\nWrexham enjoyed their best ever Third Division North season in 1932\u201333, when they finished runners-up to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and won 18 of their 21 home games during the course of the season. This was the first season that the club appeared in their now-familiar red and white strip for the first time for the short-lived 1939\u201340 season.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] years, when long cross-county trips were impossible due to the war, Wrexham played in the ''Regional League West'' against local teams from [[Merseyside]] and [[Manchester]], amongst others in the north west region. Wrexham's position as a barracks town meant that the team could secure the services of many famous guest players such as [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Stan Cullis]].\n\nIn the first post-war season Wrexham equalled their best ever position when they again finished third in the Third Division North. In the summer of 1949 the club made its first ever tour abroad when it played three games against the British army in Germany.\n\nThe club reached the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1956\u201357 where they played [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Busby Babes]] in front of a crowd of 34,445 people at the Racecourse, which still remains a club record. The 5\u20130 defeat did not spoil the occasion for the large home crowd, and later that season Wrexham managed to win the Welsh Cup for the first time in 26 years.\n\n===1960\u20131970===\n1960 saw the club were relegated for the first time in their history, and they dropped into the newly created Fourth Division. But their performances did improve following the appointment of [[Ken Barnes (footballer)|Ken Barnes]] as player-manager. He led Wrexham straight back to promotion to the third division in his first season in charge and oversaw the 10\u20131 trouncing of [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], which is still the club's record league victory. Two years after their promotion, Wrexham were relegated to the Fourth Division again, and in 1966 they finished rock-bottom at 92nd in the Football League after an extremely disappointing season.\n\n===1970\u20131982===\nWith Welsh clubs now able to qualify for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] by winning the Welsh Cup, Wrexham played their inaugural match in Europe against Swiss side [[FC Zurich]] in Switzerland on 13 September 1972, the game finishing 1\u20131. In the return leg Wrexham won 2\u20131, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20132 win on aggregate. The second round drew Wrexham against Yugoslav side [[Hajduk Split]]. Over the course of two games the score finished 3\u20133 on aggregate with Wrexham matching their more illustrious opponents, but they were knocked out of the competition due to the [[away goals rule]].\n\nThe 1972\u201373 season saw the completion of the new Yale stand, with the ability to hold a capacity of up to 5,500, including the terrace helped to comprise the bottom tier of the stand.\n\nThe 1973\u201374 season saw Wrexham change their badge from the [[Maelor]] crest to a brand new badge that had a lot more resemblance to the Welsh roots of the club, with three feathers on the top of the badge and two dragons, one on either side of the badge and facing inwards. This is still the present badge for today's team. This season also saw Wrexham reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in another cup run. After victories over [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and Southampton, their cup run finally came to end against first division side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]], with just over 20,000 Wrexham fans present to watch the match. Also that season Wrexham just missed out on the promotion spots, finishing in 4th place at the end of the season.\n\n1975\u201376 saw [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]]'s starlets captained by Eddie May, again shocked the football world by reaching the quarter finals of the European cup-winners cup after another sparkling cup run and multiple defeats of higher quality opponents. In the first round Wrexham beat Swedish team [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]] 3\u20132 on aggregate. They then managed to knock out Polish side [[Stal Rzeszow]] 3\u20131 on aggregate. Wrexham played Belgian champions [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in the quarter finals and narrowly lost 2\u20131 to the eventual winners of the competition.\n\nThe 1976\u201377 season saw Wrexham again beat First Division opposition in both Cup competitions as they went on another cup run, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the Football League Cup and Sunderland in the FA Cup, however the league season was a traumatic one as the club, on the verge of promotion to the second division with only four matches left to play, required just three points to reach their goal, and unbelievably they missed out after a poor run of form.\n\n[[Arfon Griffiths]] took over as player-manager for the 1977\u201378 season. They reached both the League and FA Cup quarter-finals that season, and Wrexham finally clinched promotion to the second division when they beat Rotherham United 7\u20131 at a packed Racecourse, and Wrexham went on to win the Third Division Championship that year.\n\nIn the 1978\u201379 season Wrexham made it to the fourth round of the FA Cup where they narrowly lost to Tottenham Hotspur 3\u20132 in the replay after the first game finished 3\u20133, the Spurs team had stars amongst their ranks such as [[Ossie Ardiles]], [[Ricky Villa]] and [[Glenn Hoddle]] in their team, and Wrexham were unfortunate to get knocked out.\n\nFollowing Arfon Griffiths resignation from the manager's position in 1981, his assistant [[Mel Sutton]] was put in charge, with the memorable third round FA Cup win over Brian Clough's [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in another cup run, the highlight of the season.\n\n===1982\u20131992===\nThe summer of 1982 saw [[Bobby Roberts (footballer)|Bobby Roberts]] appointed the club's new manager. Relegation meant the club had dire financial problems, resulting in the sale of many of the club's experienced and talented players. Frank Carrdus, [[Ian Edwards (footballer born 1955)|Ian Edwards]], Mick Vinter and Wayne Cegieski had already left during the summer, Steve Fox, [[Joey Jones]], [[Dixie McNeil]] and [[Billy Ronson]] soon followed. Wrexham were again relegated to the Fourth Division after plummeting from apparent mid-table security. The club's slide continued into the following season, and only goal difference prevented Wrexham from being forced to apply for re-election to the League.\n\nThe 1984\u201385 season saw Wrexham take on [[FC Porto]] in European competition. Wrexham won the home leg with a 1\u20130 victory, but in the second leg Porto showed their class and were 3\u20130 up after 38 minutes, however Wrexham pulled goals back and the game finished 4\u20133 with Wrexham advancing on away goals. The second round draw was to pair Wrexham with Italian [[AS Roma]], managed by [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]. Wrexham lost 3\u20130 on aggregate over the two legs. Their league performance was even more dire than the previous year, and by the time Bobby Roberts was finally removed from his post, Wrexham were rock-bottom of the entire Football League.\n\nFormer Racecourse favourite Dixie McNeil was appointed caretaker manager, and immediately inspired a revival that saw Wrexham win 7 of their last 10 matches and comfortably finish clear of having to apply for re-election, which earned him the job on a permanent basis that summer. His first season in charge saw the team finish mid-table position in an average season, he led the team to a Welsh Cup final win over Kidderminster Harriers. 1986 saw Wrexham make a return to European football with a first round draw against Maltese side FC Zurrieq, whom they beat 7\u20130 on aggregate to earn a second round tie against [[Real Zaragoza]] which they drew 2\u20132 with on aggregate but they went out on away-goals.\n\nFollowing the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] in May 1985, legislation on ground safety at all football grounds was brought in effect, this eventually led to the closure of the Mold Road stand because it did not reach the necessary safety standards. Led by Dixie McNeil, Wrexham reached the Fourth Division play-offs in 1989, having finished seventh in the league. Wrexham beat [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the semi-final 5\u20131 on aggregate, but narrowly lost to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] 2\u20131 in the final. After Wrexham started the next season with just 3 wins from 13 league games, Dixie McNeil resigned before his inevitable sacking.\n\nHe was replaced, initially on a temporary basis, by [[Brian Flynn]], but his appointment was made permanent a month later. However the club continued to struggle domestically, and Flynn was forced to make three important signings in Mark Setori, [[Eddie Youds]] and [[Alan Kennedy]] which saw the team finish in twenty-first place, therefore avoiding relegation.\n\nThe 1990\u201391 season it was announced there would be no relegation to the [[Conference Premier]] as a team had already voluntarily left the league. That season Wrexham were to finish in ninety-second place. Wrexham were knocked-out of the European Cup Winners' Cup in the second round by Manchester United 5\u20130 on aggregate, who eventually went on to win the trophy.\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season saw Wrexham still in a poor financial state, as they continued to struggle on the field. With the club knocked out of the League Cup and struggling in the league, it was left to the FA Cup to keep the season alive. Having beaten [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]] and [[Winsford United F.C.|Winsford United]] they were drawn to play the previous season's First Division champions and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Wrexham produced one of their most memorable nights to beat the Gunners 2\u20131 after being behind, with a thunderous [[Mickey Thomas (footballer)|Mickey Thomas]] free kick and a [[Steve Watkin (footballer)|Steve Watkin]] goal. They lost in the next round to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130 in a replay after the first game had finished 2\u20132.\n\n===1993\u20132001===\nIn an attempt to change the fortunes of the club after several seasons in the doldrums at the bottom of the football league pyramid, the 1992\u201393 season saw Wrexham manager Brian Flynn make a shrewd signing when he enlisted the services of Gary Bennett, who soon settled and helped Wrexham into the promotion race. Wrexham's season came to a head on 27 April 1993 when with two games left they travelled to [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] requiring a win to gain promotion to the next tier of the English football. The game ended with a 2\u20130 victory to Wrexham and the 5,500 travelling \"Reds\" supporters there were jubilant when promotion had finally been achieved.\n\nThe 1994\u201395 season would see Wrexham achieve more success in cup competitions, this time going on a run through the FA Cup. Having beaten [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] and Rotherham United, they faced Premier League side [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the Racecourse, with Wrexham running out 2\u20131 winners thanks to goals from [[Gary Bennett (footballer born 1962)|Gary Bennett]] and [[Kieron Durkan]]. In the next round, Wrexham were drawn away to Manchester United and despite taking the lead at [[Old Trafford]], United went on to win 5\u20132.\n\nThe 1995\u201396 season once again saw Wrexham in European action, with their opposition this time coming in the form of Romanian team [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]; the home leg ended in a 0\u20130 draw but Wrexham lost 1\u20130 in the away leg, with the Romanians scoring the only goal of the match, and Wrexham were subsequently knocked out of the tournament.\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season saw Wrexham set off on another amazing run in the FA Cup and beating more top flight opposition. Following wins at [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]] and Scunthorpe United, they were drawn to play West Ham United at home, the game ending in a 1\u20131 draw on a snow-covered pitch after a well earned draw. The replay at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] ended in a shock 1\u20130 win to Wrexham as [[Kevin Russell (footballer)|Kevin Russell]] scored in the dying minutes to send Wrexham into the fourth round.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Ham fear FA censure over pitch invasion |first=Mark |last=Pierson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-west-ham-fear-fa-censure-over-pitch-invasion-1285373.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 January 1997 |accessdate=7 April 2012 }}</ref> After also beating [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and Birmingham City in the following rounds, they played [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in an all-Division-2 FA Cup quarter final, Wrexham narrowly losing to the Spireites 1\u20130.\n\nJune 1997 was the date for the official opening of Colliers Park, which was Wrexham's new training ground and was situated just outside [[Gresford]] on Chester Road. It was built at a cost of \u00a3750,000 and is widely regarded to be one of the best training grounds outside of the top flight. It has been used for training by many visiting teams that play at a higher standard over the years.\n\nThe 1999\u20132000 season saw Wrexham again beat a top-flight team in the FA Cup, this time in the shape of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. The final score of the match was 2\u20131, with the second half goals coming from [[Robin Gibson (footballer)|Robin Gibson]] and [[Darren Ferguson]] after being behind to the Premiership outfit. Wrexham went on to win the [[FAW Premier Cup]] in May 2001.\n\n===2001\u20132008===\n[[File:Ryan Valentine scores.jpg|thumb|5 May 2007: Ryan Valentine scores the goal against Boston that keeps Wrexham in the Football League]] \n[[File:Wrexham 3 Boston 1.jpg|thumb|5 May 2007: Scoreboard showing the final score of game that kept Wrexham in the Football League and condemned Boston United to the Conference]] At the start of the 21st century the club was dogged with many problems off the pitch, including then chairman [[Alex Hamilton (property developer)|Alex Hamilton]], attempting to get the club evicted from the stadium so that he could use and sell it for his own development purposes \u2013 the saga involved the sale of the Racecourse Ground to a separate company owned by Hamilton immediately after he became the club's chairman. In the summer of 2004 Hamilton gave the club a year's notice to quit the ground.<ref>{{cite news|title=Timeline: Crisis at Wrexham FC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4022209.stm|accessdate=4 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe club's fans developed an affinity with the fans of fellow football league club [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], who themselves had managed to successfully depose their chairman and keep control of their stadium after he had sold the ground for development purposes in almost the same circumstances.\n\nOn 3 December 2004 the club was placed in [[Administration (insolvency)|financial administration]] by the High Court in [[Manchester]] as the club owed \u00a32,600,000, including \u00a3800,000 which was owed to the [[Inland Revenue]] in unpaid taxes. Wrexham became the first League club to suffer a ten-point deduction under the new rule for being placed in administration, dropping them from the middle of the League One table to the relegation zone after the point deduction, and subsequently condemned Wrexham to relegation.\n\nDespite their financial troubles, Wrexham went on to win the 2004\u201305 [[Football League Trophy]] by defeating [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] 2\u20130 after extra time, in Wrexham's first appearance at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]]. It was Southend's second consecutive defeat in the Football League Trophy final. The winning goals were scored by [[Juan Ugarte]] and [[Darren Ferguson]] as Wrexham ran out winners in front of over 20,000 Wrexham fans.\n\nWrexham still retained an outside chance of escaping the drop in the 2004\u201305 season following an end-of-season winning streak; however, their faint hopes of staying up were ended with a 2\u20131 home loss to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 3 May 2005. The 10-point deduction proved decisive in determining Wrexham's fate, as the club finished with 43 points compared to 20th-placed [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]' 51 \u2013 a net points tally of 53 after deduction, which had condemned them to relegation.\n\nIn October 2005, Birmingham High Court decided that Alex Hamilton's company CrucialMove had improperly acquired the freehold of the ground and the decision went against him. Hamilton then took this to the Appeal Court in London and it ruled on 14 March 2006 that the stadium must remain in the hands of the club's administrators. On 30 April 2006 the administrators reached an agreement with local car dealer Neville Dickens, subject to agreement by the shareholders and creditors (which was achieved on 30 May), for Dickens to take over control of the club and all its assets. Had the club still been in Administration by 3 June then Wrexham would have automatically been expelled from the League because of their financial situation.\n\n''Wrexham Football Club (2006) Ltd'' is the name of the \"phoenix\" company that took over the assets of the old ''Wrexham Association Football Club Limited'' \u2013 technically, the club is no longer known as ''Wrexham Association Football Club'' due to the takeover of the club by Neville Dickens and Geoff Moss and their associates; this is reflected on new merchandise, although most fans will still refer to it as \"Wrexham AFC\".\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season started well for Wrexham, as they went 8 games unbeaten, with included a 4\u20131 away win against Championship side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and were in the play-off places after the addition of numerous new faces. Unfortunately they were beaten in a shock 5\u20130 defeat at [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] on 13 September 2006, then followed by a 5\u20132 defeat at Stockport County. Both of these teams were struggling at the foot of the table when these defeats happened, and Wrexham never fully recovered from them. This would begin the start of a long relegation battle for Wrexham. [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]] was sacked along with his assistant Kevin Russell on 11 January 2007 with Wrexham in the bottom half of the division and after a poor run of results and was replaced by coach [[Brian Carey]]. Wrexham finished 19th in [[Football League Two]] and on 51 points after an impressive late run of form which saw them win 4 out of their last 5 games, which included defeating local rivals Shrewsbury in the last ever derby match at Gay Meadow. Wrexham's league status was saved on the last day of the season with a vital 3\u20131 victory on 5 May 2007 over [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] at home which sent their opponents down to the [[Conference Premier]]  (they were later demoted to the Conference North) and ensured that Wrexham would stay in the [[Football League]].\n\nExpectations were high for the 2007\u201308 season, as there had been the signings of players such as [[Anthony Williams (footballer)|Anthony Williams]], [[Richard Hope]], [[Michael Proctor (footballer)|Michael Proctor]], [[Silvio Spann]] and [[Eifion Williams]] and a push for promotion was expected by the fans after the disappointment of last season. But the season started badly, with only three wins and 10 points by the middle of November and Wrexham rooted to the bottom of the table.\n\nBrian Carey was eventually sacked after Wrexham crashed out of the FA Cup in the First Round following a 4\u20131 defeat against Peterborough United. On 6 November 2007 Wrexham Football Club released a statement saying that the club were looking for an \"experienced senior manager\" to work alongside the current Racecourse staff. On 15 November 2007, [[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]] was named as Wrexham's new manager and the replacement to Brian Carey, who took the role of assistant manager.\n\nAfter a promising start to his reign, a run of 7 straight league defeats and a 4\u20132 defeat in the FAW Premier Cup at the hands of [[Llanelli A.F.C.|Llanelli]], forced Little to ring the changes and brought in 11 players in the January transfer window to attempt to change Wrexham's fortunes. In terms of the backstage staff, he brought in former Port Vale boss [[Martin Foyle]] as first-team coach and several members of staff were told that they had no future at The Racecourse. With the new players introduced Wrexham went a run of six matches unbeaten, which included victories against promotion candidates [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] and [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] and a 0\u20130 draw against Peterborough United. However, in the final months of the season many of Little's new players had become injured and Wrexham suffered several defeats against fellow strugglers in the league and were also defeated 3\u20130 in a derby match against Shrewsbury Town. Wrexham were finally relegated following a 2\u20130 defeat away at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], ending the club's 87-year stay in the Football League.\n\n===2008\u2013===\nThe 2008\u201309 season started well, with a 5\u20130 home victory against [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]], however a run of poor results followed, with Wrexham being left in the mid-table battle, only four points above the relegation zone and only keeping two clean sheets all season. Following a 3\u20130 home defeat against [[Rushden and Diamonds F.C.|Rushden and Diamonds]], and fans calling for his dismissal, Little left Wrexham by mutual consent. Since then, [[Dean Saunders]] has taken over the management of Wrexham, with his first game against [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] ending in a victory. Wrexham's first full season in the Conference Premier ended in a disappointing 10th place. The following year, 2009\u201310, ended in a similar fashion with Wrexham finishing in 11th position, well off the pace of the promotion battle.\n\nIn March 2011 the ownership of the club became subject to two bids: one from Wrexham Supporters' Trust and another from local businesswoman [[Stephanie Booth]]. Wrexham's MP and AM indicated that they would prefer Wrexham Supporters' Trust to secure the bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supporters-direct.org/news/item.asp?n=12301&cat=sd_eng|title=Welcome \u2013 Supporters Direct|website=Supporters-direct.org|access-date=25 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414211310/http://www.supporters-direct.org/news/item.asp?n=12301&cat=sd_eng|archive-date=14 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A third bid later came in, but after WST and Booth came to an agreement, their bid was then reaccepted.\n\nIn April 2011, the club were served with a winding up order from HMRC, with an unpaid tax bill of just under \u00a3200,000. The team finished the 2010\u201311 season in 4th place, qualifying for a play-off spot.\n\nOn 5 May 2011 Wrexham played their first play-off game against Luton Town at home: Wrexham were 3\u20130 down in the first half and failed to score in the second half.\n[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9475718.stm]\n\nOn 10 May 2011 Wrexham played their second play-off game: Wrexham went 1\u20130 up after Andy Mangan scored in the 8th minute, Gareth Taylor later missed a penalty, Luton went on to win 5\u20131 on aggregate. Over 800 Wrexham fans were present at Kenilworth Road.\n\nDuring the 2011\u201312 season, Wrexham FC were invited back into the [[Welsh Cup]] after 16 years, entering at the third round stage. Their first game was at home to [[Airbus UK Broughton FC|Airbus UK]], but a schedule clash meant that the club were required to play two games on 3 December 2011, one against Airbus, and the other against [[Brentford FC]] in the second round of the FA Cup. Although the scratch side fielded against Airbus lost, the first team fielded against Brentford produced a shock 1\u20130 win. On 4 December Wrexham were drawn away to [[Brighton and Hove Albion FC]] in the third round of the FA Cup in which they drew 1\u20131, with the away sides goal coming from Adrian Cieslewicz. The replay, at the [[Racecourse Ground]] was also 1\u20131, with [[Brighton and Hove Albion FC]] winning 5\u20134 on penalties. Player-Manager [[Andy Morrell]] scored Wrexham's goal.\n\nNew manager Andy Morrell guided Wrexham to a record tally of 98 points but this was not enough to gain automatic promotion, as they ended the season only 5 points adrift of Fleetwood Town, who gained the only automatic place. Wrexham lost in the play-offs to Luton Town again.\n\nWrexham earned themselves places in both the [[2013 FA Trophy Final|FA Trophy final]] and the [[2013 Conference Premier play-off Final|Conference Premier play-off final]], their first two appearances at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the club's 150-year history to date, and within five weeks of one another. In the FA Trophy final Wrexham won on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. A 5\u20132 aggregate win over [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] in the two-legged play-off semi-final saw Wrexham through to the final versus [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], the first play-off final to feature two Welsh teams; Newport defeated Wrexham 2\u20130.\n\nOn 24 February 2014, Andy Morrell stepped down as manager, \"I feel it is in the best interests of both Wrexham FC and me to make a change now,\" Morrell said in a statement. Billy Barr took temporary control of Wrexham Football Club until 20 March 2014 when [[Kevin Wilkin]] was announced as the new First Team Manager, joining from Nuneaton Town on a two and a half year deal. Wrexham finished the 2013\u201314 season in 17th place, the lowest position in the club's 150-year history.\n\n==Seasons==\nStatistics from recent seasons.

FC.jpg|260px|thumb|right|The Kop End and Mold Road Stand (foreground)]]\n\n{{Main|Racecourse Ground}}\n\nThe Racecourse Ground is situated on the Mold Road, which is the main through road heading into Wrexham, it is opposite the residential area of Maesgwyn, situated between [[Glynd\u0175r University]] and [[Wrexham General railway station]]. In August 2011 Glynd\u0175r University purchased the stadium and the club training facilities in [[Gresford]]. Since then, they have added their name to the stadium for it to become The Glynd\u0175r University Racecourse Stadium. Subsequently, in 2016, Wrexham Supporters Trust secured a 99-year lease on the ground, and the name has reverted to the Racecourse Ground. The capacity is 10,500, making it one of the largest stadiums in the National League.\n\n===Stands===\n'''The Kop Stand''': the all-standing home stand, is named after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], as many grounds in the UK used to have ends named similarly. Behind the goal, it is known officially as the Crispin Lane End or \"Town End\". With a capacity of 5,000, the Kop Stand was the largest all-standing terrace in the English Football League but is now no longer in use.\n\n'''BKoncepts Stand''', capacity 4,200, formerly the Yale Stand, this stand is home to the main hospitality area for a match-day called the Bamford Suite, below this suite on ground level is the stadium's social bar area called the Centenary Club. Under this stand you can also find the main ticket office and club shop along with the main staff offices, boardroom, executive room, changing rooms, kit room, and physio room.\n\n'''Tech End''':, capacity 2,800. traditionally the away stand at the Racecourse Ground, since the 2007\u201308 season home fans have been located in this stand and away fans moved to the wing of the BKoncepts Stand, with the exception of games where a large away attendance is anticipated such as the Chester, Tranmere Rovers, and Newport County fixtures. This stand is noted for its excellent acoustics where an excellent atmosphere can be made, however this only happens when Chester turn up, otherwise it is normally quiet. Under this stand now is also Jonesy's Bar which has now been open since the 2016/17 season.\n\n'''Mold Road Stand''':, capacity 3,500. The newest stand, built in 1999 at a cost of \u00a33.5m, which was secured with lottery funding, in time to host the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] pool game between Samoa and Japan, where a crowd of over 14,000 turned up to see a Samoan victory. The stand's unique design is attributed to the Turf Hotel Pub, which is situated on the corner of the stadium. The stand possesses a TV studio and eight fully equipped private boxes, and has a match-day restaurant called \"The 1864 Suite\"; there is also an old programme shop which is run by volunteers adjacent to the stand. A family area was introduced in the 2009\u201310 season, located to the area of the stand nearest to the Kop \u2013 the \"Town End\" and is known as the L&D Brothers Family Stand. Inside the foyer entrance to this stand you can also find a small ticket office which is open for 1 hour prior to kick-off and sells tickets just for that stand to take pressure from the main ticket office under the BKoncepts Stand.\n\n'''Other uses and teams''': The Racecourse Ground has been used by other teams such as [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]] for their qualifying matches in the [[UEFA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. It was the venue for the Champions League encounter between [[The New Saints F.C.|T.N.S.]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2005, watched by a crowd of 8,009, two late goals by [[Steven Gerrard]] sealed a 3\u20130 win for Liverpool. Bangor City played [[FC Midtjylland]] match in 2008, which resulted in a 6\u20131 victory for the [[Denmark|Danish]] team. [[Cefn Druids A.F.C.|Cefn Druids]] played their first ever [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match on the ground in July 2012 \u2013 a scoreless draw with Finnish side [[MYPA|MyPa]].\n\nThe Racecourse Ground is not only used for footballing purposes; as in the past, the [[Scarlets|Llanelli Scarlets]] Rugby Union and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales Rugby Union]] sides have played home games in the historical stadium, as well as the Rugby League side North Wales Crusaders. It has held 4 music concerts since 2016.\n\n==Training ground==\n\nWrexham's training ground was the purpose-built [[Colliers Park, Wrexham|Colliers Park]], in neighbouring [[Gresford]]. When the construction had been completed it was officially opened in June 1997, at a building cost of \u00a3750,000. It is widely regarded in British football as one of the best training grounds outside of the top flight and one of the best never to have been used by a top-flight team. The [[England national football team|England national team]], [[F.C Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]] have all used it for training purposes. Colliers Park continues to be improved, a running hill, as well as all-weather pitches and a small stand have been constructed since the facilities opened in 1997. Colliers Park is now owned by Glyndwr University as part of their purchase of the Racecourse Ground assets.\n\nFor the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season, Wrexham moved back to their former training ground at [[Stansty Park]]. This is also the home of [[Welsh National League (Wrexham Area)|Welsh National League]] side [[Lex XI F.C.|Lex Glyndwr]]. Wrexham did however retain the use of Colliers Park for Youth and Reserve fixtures. After one season training at Stansty Park, Wrexham announced they would be moving to a new training ground at Nine Acre for the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season based near the town centre and are still there at present.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n\n====League====\n\n*'''[[Football League Third Division North]] / [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] / [[Football League

The mascot Wrex the dragon (along with the team nickname \"The Dragons\"), was introduced in 2001\u201302 by the Commercial manager following a ballot of fans to help increase sponsorship and promote the club's Welsh image whilst also providing a more original nickname as [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Swindon Town]] and [[Cheltenham Town]] also use the nickname of 'The Robins'.\n'Wrex' wears a red face and Wrexham F.C. shirt wearing the number \"1864\" on his back; at the time this was thought to have been the year Wrexham F.C. was officially founded, although more recently uncovered evidence suggests the club was actually founded nine years earlier in 1864.\nPrevious mascot Rockin' Robin was also famous for having a wife called Tina Turfit (plus a son, Robinson). A trouble-maker from the moment he was hatched, this rampant robin has left damage and destruction wherever he's gone. The Welsh wildman has set off a fire extinguisher before a game, ridden onto the pitch on a bike and tried to run over a linesman (for which he was sent off by the club's managing director) and dug huge divots from the ground with a pitchfork. Among his other acts of skulduggery are poking fun at the linesmen \u2013 he waves his own flag when the ball goes out of play \u2013 and running onto the pitch waving a pole (another early bath offence). This seen him regularly getting him into trouble with then manager [[Brian Flynn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-sweeper--mascot-on-the-mat-1073572.html|title=US|website=Independent.co.uk}}</ref> Rockin Robin was also sent off by the referee in the Wrexham vs. [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] game. Rockin' Robin returned for the 150th Anniversary Match vs Grimsby Town on 11 October.\n\n==Reserves==\nBetween 1988 and 1995 the reserve team of Wrexham played in the Welsh football leagues.<ref>{{cite web|title=WREXHAM RESERVES|url=http://fchd.info/WREXHAM2.HTM|publisher=Football Club History Database|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season!!League!!Played!!Won!!Drew!!Lost!!Goals for!!Goals against!!Points!!Final position!!Teams in League\n|-\n|1988\u201389||[[Welsh National League (Wrexham Area)]]||30||21||4||5||89||36||67||2||16\n|-\n|1989\u201390||[[Welsh National League (Wrexham Area)]]||30||23||1||6||92||30||70||2||16\n|-\n|1990\u201391||[[Welsh National League (Wrexham Area)]]||26||12||7||7||60||39||43||4||14\n|-\n|1991\u201392||[[Welsh National League (Wrexham Area)]]||26||18||2||6||63||28||56||1||14\n|-\n|1992\u201393||[[Cymru Alliance]]||28||19||4||5||81||34||61||4||15\n|-\n|1993\u201394||[[Cymru Alliance]]||34||20||6||8||83||38||66||3||18\n|-\n|1994\u201395||[[Cymru Alliance]]||34||24||5||5||101||39||74||3||18\n|}\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 season they won the Cyrmu Alliance League Cup.\n\n==Literature==\n\n''Wrexham related books''\n*''Wrexham FC 1872\u20131950'' by Peter Jones and Gareth Davies\n*''Wrexham FC 1950\u20132000'' by Peter Jones and Gareth Davies\n*''Wrexham \u2013 A Complete Record 1872 \u2013 1992'' by Peter Jones\n*''Wrexham; The European era'' by Peter Jones\n*''Wrexham; Through The Trap Door'' by Peter Jones\n*''Wrexham FC, An A-Z history'' by Dean Hayes\n*''The Racecourse Robins from Adams to Youds'' by Peter Jones and Gareth Davies\n*''The Giant Killers; a Wrexham fan's view'' by Richard Partington\n*''Wrexham Football Club Pen-Portraits'' by Don Meredith\n\nThe Wrexham football team plays a significant role in the 1994 Peter Davies book ''Twenty Two Foreigners in Funny Shorts'' which was written for the World Cup in the US.
