It is manufactured at the company's [[Wolfsburg Volkswagen Plant|Wolfsburg plant]] and sold in restaurants in its six German factories.  The [[currywurst]] are also sold externally at supermarkets and football stadiums and given away to Volkswagen customers.  The sausage is branded as a \"Volkwagen Original Part\" and has been given the part number 199 398 500 A.  The product has been described as the most produced of any of Volkswagen's parts, some 6.81 million sausages being manufactured in 2018.  In many recent years the company has produced more sausages than cars.  A Volkswagen [[ketchup]] is also produced and sold to accompany the currywurst.\n\n== Description==\nThe sausage is manufactured in a part of the [[Wolfsburg Volkswagen Plant]] by a team of 30 people.<ref name=auto/> The sausage is made in two sizes, one approximately {{convert|5|in|cm}} long and one approximately {{convert|10|in|cm}} long.<ref name=ozy/> The larger sized sausage weighs around {{convert|170|g|oz}}.<ref name=auto/>\n\nThe sausage is made from pork delivered to the factory three times a week.<ref name=np/> The pork cuts are trimmed to remove excess fat, which provides a fat content to the sausage of approximately 20%, significantly lower than the 35% usual for a [[bratwurst]] sausage.<ref name=auto/>  The pork is then ground and mixed with a secret recipe of spices before being inserted into sausage skins branded with ''Volkswagen Originalteil'' (\"Volkwagen Original Part\").<ref name=auto/><ref name=fortune/> The sausages are hung on racks and smoked over beechwood for 100 minutes at {{convert|176|C|F}}.
