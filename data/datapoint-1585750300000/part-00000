An additional $100,000 of matching support from [[Craig Newmark]]'s [[News Integrity Initiative]] was also expected.<ref name=Medium/>.\n\nIn a [[Medium (website)|Medium]] post published in May 2017, WikiTribune said it had met its funding goal, but would not start operations until later that year:<ref name=Mediapost />\n\n{{Quote|Despite lots of confused comments, the end of the crowdfunding campaign doesn't mean an instantaneous launch.

She had previously worked at the ''[[Honolulu Civil Beat]]'', which was founded by [[Pierre Omidyar]] with similar ideas of \"peer news\". LaFrance thought the plan was over-ambitious as a staff of ten was insufficient to cover global news stories and managing volunteer input would be time-consuming.<ref name=Atlantic/>\n\n[[Andrew Lih]], a researcher at the [[American University]]'s school of communication, expected WikiTribune's hybrid approach to be more successful than the volunteer-only model of [[Wikinews]]: \"You have an operational command structure that\u2019s based on full-time staff. The pro journalists and editors provide the supervision on how the story moves forward. The crowd does the heavy lifting on a lot of the combing, sifting, searching, checking. You let the crowd do what the crowd is good at.\"<ref name=Nieman/>\n\n[[Sarah Baxter]], deputy editor of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', addressed WikiTribune in the newspaper in April 2017 in \"Wikipedia won't break real news, just tweak it\". After critical remarks on the [[reliability of Wikipedia]], she said: \"It's the warp and weft of debate in the free press, whether digital or print, that gets to the heart of the truth, not the wacky wisdom of self-appointed crowds.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/wikipedia-wont-break-real-news-just-tweak-it-m6jc3pg3j|title=Wikipedia won't break real news, just tweak it|publisher=Sunday Times|date=30 April 2017|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Emily Bell]], director of the [[Tow Center for Digital Journalism]], reviewed coverage of the project four days after the initial announcement.  She said that there was considerable scepticism which was apparent in an [[Reddit#IAmA and AMA|Ask Me Anything]] session held by Wales.  She thought that WikiTribune would duplicate work which was already being done and gave examples such as [[David Fahrenthold]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] prize-winning coverage of the [[2016 United States presidential election|United States presidential election]] for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', during which he used [[Twitter]] to engage with the public.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nZahera Harb, a lecturer in journalism at [[City University of London]], questioned the site's reliance on unpaid volunteers, saying, \"I see a model closer to 'exploitation' than anything else.\" She also wrote that the site would be susceptible to error and bias: \"In this system, we will encounter mistakes similar to those we have been seeing in Wikipedia. Those mistakes tend to cause the same harm as fake news.{{nbsp}}...

An additional $100,000 of matching support from [[Craig Newmark]]'s [[News Integrity Initiative]] was also expected.<ref name=Medium/>.\n\nIn a [[Medium (website)|Medium]] post published in May 2017, WikiTribune said it had met its funding goal, but would not start operations until later that year:<ref name=Mediapost />\n\n{{Quote|Despite lots of confused comments, the end of the crowdfunding campaign doesn't mean an instantaneous launch.

We\u2019ll do it faster if we can, but only if we can do it right.}}\n\nIn a [[Medium (website)|Medium]] post published in July 2017, WikiTribune introduced three of their initial ten journalists as [[Holly Brockwell]], Harry Ridgewell, and Linh Nguyen.<ref name=Introduction/>\n\nOn October 23, 2018, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that WikiTribune had laid off its team of reporters and editors, \"a year after it launched with a promise to reinvent journalism.\" Volunteers could then publish articles without having them checked by professionals, although a new team of journalists purportedly was to be hired to work in support roles. \"Despite the best efforts of staff, the overall structure and design didn't let the community genuinely flourish,\" said founder Jimmy Wales. \"We didn't get very much work done.\" Funded by donations rather than advertisers, the site remained free to access.<ref name=LaidOff/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Adrienne LaFrance]] reviewed the WikiTribune proposal in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. She had previously worked at the ''[[Honolulu Civil Beat]]'', which was founded by [[Pierre Omidyar]] with similar ideas of \"peer news\". LaFrance thought the plan was over-ambitious as a staff of ten was insufficient to cover global news stories and managing volunteer input would be time-consuming.<ref name=Atlantic/>\n\n[[Andrew Lih]], a researcher at the [[American University]]'s school of communication, expected WikiTribune's hybrid approach to be more successful than the volunteer-only model of [[Wikinews]]: \"You have an operational command structure that\u2019s based on full-time staff. The pro journalists and editors provide the supervision on how the story moves forward. The crowd does the heavy lifting on a lot of the combing, sifting, searching, checking. You let the crowd do what the crowd is good at.\"<ref name=Nieman/>\n\n[[Sarah Baxter]], deputy editor of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', addressed WikiTribune in the newspaper in April 2017 in \"Wikipedia won't break real news, just tweak it\". After critical remarks on the [[reliability of Wikipedia]], she said: \"It's the warp and weft of debate in the free press, whether digital or print, that gets to the heart of the truth, not the wacky wisdom of self-appointed crowds.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/wikipedia-wont-break-real-news-just-tweak-it-m6jc3pg3j|title=Wikipedia won't break real news, just tweak it|publisher=Sunday Times|date=30 April 2017|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Emily Bell]], director of the [[Tow Center for Digital Journalism]], reviewed coverage of the project four days after the initial announcement.  She said that there was considerable scepticism which was apparent in an [[Reddit#IAmA and AMA|Ask Me Anything]] session held by Wales.  She thought that WikiTribune would duplicate work which was already being done and gave examples such as [[David Fahrenthold]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] prize-winning coverage of the [[2016 United States presidential election|United States presidential election]] for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', during which he used [[Twitter]] to engage with the public.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nZahera Harb, a lecturer in journalism at [[City University of London]], questioned the site's reliance on unpaid volunteers, saying, \"I see a model closer to 'exploitation' than anything else.\" She also wrote that the site would be susceptible to error and bias: \"In this system, we will encounter mistakes similar to those we have been seeing in Wikipedia. Those mistakes tend to cause the same harm as fake news.{{nbsp}}... Meddling with Wikipedia accounts has become a tool in media wars between political and economic rivals and also between countries that are in conflict over territory or that have conflicting historical narratives.\"<ref name=Harb/>\n\nStaff at a media law firm, [[Hogan Lovells]], speculated whether the proposed [[Collaborative journalism|collaborative model of journalism]] would provide sufficient protection against the English [[Defamation Act 2013]] and concluded that the matter was not certain in law and so would depend upon the outcome of future court actions.<ref name=HL/>\n\nWikiTribune has been compared to [[Correctiv|CORRECT!V]], a non-profit investigative journalism centre in Germany;<ref name=FT/> ''[[De Correspondent]]'', a Dutch news site financed by crowd-funding and charities;<ref name=Hern/> and ''[[Krautreporter]]'', a German news website supported by crowd-funding.<ref name=SRF/>\n\nAccording to ''[[The Times]]'', the site's first \"taster\" article, published in September 2017, \"prompted such derision from supporters that some cancelled their monthly donations in protest\"; readers reportedly complained that the article \"was littered with factual errors and incomprehensible sentences\" and seemed to have a pronounced [[liberal bias]].<ref name=Times141017 />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Internet|Journalism}}\n* [[Wikinews]]\n* [[Crowdfunded Journalism]]\n* [[Open-source journalism]]\n* [[Wiki journalism]]\n* [[PediaPress]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |refs=\n<ref name=AT>{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/04/jimmy-wales-wikitribune/ | title=Wikitribune is Jimmy Wales' attempt to wage war on fake news | work=Ars Technica | date=25 April 2017 | accessdate=25 April 2017 | author=Fiveash, Kelly}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Mediapost>{{cite news |title=WikiTribune Meets Funding Goal: What's Next?, More Funding |last=Mandese |first=Joe |url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/302091/wikitribune-meets-funding-goal-whats-next-more.html |publisher=MediaPost Communications |date= 31 May 2017 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hern>{{cite news |last1=Hern |first1=Alex |title=Wikipedia founder to fight fake news with new Wikitribune site |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/25/wikipedia-founder-jimmy-wales-to-fight-fake-news-with-new-wikitribune-site |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 April 2017 |accessdate=24 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=news252>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/wikipedia-launches-news-website-to-combat-the-rise-of-alternative-facts/news-story/905c6bf3d8e02d319ed7ee536e7038f0 |title=Wikipedia launches news website to combat the rise of 'alternative facts' |website=news.com.au |publisher=News Limited |date=25 April 2017 |access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BBC254>{{cite news |title=Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales creates news service Wikitribune |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39695767 |website=[[BBC News]] |date=25 April 2017 |access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FT>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2590013e-2908-11e7-9ec8-168383da43b7 |last=Bond |first=David |date=25 April 2017 |title=Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales to set up global news website}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Time254>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4753659/wikitribune-jimmy-wales-wikipedia/ |title=Jimmy Wales to Launch Crowdfunded News Site Wikitribune to Fight 'Alternative Facts' |publisher=Time.com |date=25 April 2017 |access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wired>{{citation |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/jimmy-wales-wikitribune |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=Jimmy Wales goes after fake news with Wikitribune \u2013 a crowdfunded site for reporters |author=Greg Williams interviewing Jimmy Wales |date=24 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=WT>{{citation |url=https://www.wikitribune.com/faqs-legal/ |quote=all our content will be released under a Creative Commons attribution (CC-BY) license to the maximum extent possible |title=FAQs: legal -
