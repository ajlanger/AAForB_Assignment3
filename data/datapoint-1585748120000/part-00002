By modulating [[retinoblastoma protein]] activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature [[hair cell]]s that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. [[Retinoblastoma protein]]s suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the [[cell cycle]], thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog, identified as an important regulator of Rb, may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.<ref name=\"Lu_2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu N, Chen Y, Wang Z, Chen G, Lin Q, Chen ZY, Li H | title = Sonic hedgehog initiates cochlear hair cell regeneration through downregulation of retinoblastoma protein | journal = Biochem.

Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45&nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|kDa]] and is referred to as the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short [[signal peptide|signal sequence]] at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the [[signal recognition particle]] during the translocation into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), the first step in protein [[secretion]]. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by [[signal peptidase]] in the ER. There SHH undergoes autoprocessing to generate a 20&nbsp;kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25&nbsp;kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role.<ref name=\"Bumcrot\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bumcrot DA, Takada R, McMahon AP | title = Proteolytic processing yields two secreted forms of sonic hedgehog | journal = Mol Cell Biol | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 2294\u20132303 | date = 1 April 1995 | pmid = 7891723 | pmc = 230457 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.15.4.2294 }}</ref> The cleavage is catalysed by a [[protease]] within the C-terminal domain.
