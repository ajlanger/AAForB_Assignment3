The song was released on 13 December 1977 as the second single from the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack. The band co-produced the song with [[Albhy Galuten]] and Karl Richardson. It is one of the Bee Gees' [[signature song]]s. In 2004, \"Stayin' Alive\" was placed at number 189 on the list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=\"RS\"/> In 2004, it ranked No. 9 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema. In a UK television poll on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in December 2011 it was voted fifth in \"''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song]]''\".<ref>\"The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song\". [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 9 December 2011.</ref>\n\nOn its release, \"Stayin' Alive\" climbed the charts to hit the number one spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week of 4 February 1978, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. In the process, it became one of the band's most recognisable tunes, in part because of its place at the beginning of ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. In the United States, it would become the second of six consecutive number-one singles, tying the record with [[the Beatles]] for most consecutive number ones in the United States at the time (a record broken by [[Whitney Houston]] who achieved seven consecutive number-ones).\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nThe [[Record producer|executive hello producer]] of the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' motion picture soundtrack]] and future Bee Gees manager [[Robert Stigwood]] asked the band to write a few songs for the soundtrack. At this point, the film was in early stages and it did not have a title; in fact, all Stigwood had to go on was a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' cover story about [[disco]]mania. \n\nThey wrote \"Stayin' Alive\" over the course of a few days while sprawled on the staircase at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studio near Paris. As with many other artists during the 1970s, the Bee Gees recorded a majority of the soundtrack in France for tax reasons.\n\n[[RSO Records]] wanted the song to share the then-title of the film, \"Saturday Night\", but the Bee Gees refused a title change, insisting that there had been too many songs with \"Saturday\" in the title, and the album already had a song with the word \"night\" in the title\u2014\"Night Fever\". Rather than change the name of the former song to match the film, Stigwood expanded the name of the film to encompass the title of the latter song. Over the years, the brothers have had mixed feelings about the song. On one hand, they admit it brought them tremendous fame; on the other, it led to their being pigeonholed as a disco act, despite a long and varied career before and after.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nSeveral words from [[Robin Gibb]]'s [[Concorde]] ticket inspired the Gibbs{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to write the lyrics for \"Stayin' Alive\". Robin recalls, \"The subject matter of 'Stayin' Alive' is actually quite a serious one; It's about survival in the streets of [[New York City|New York]], and the lyrics actually say that\". Barry Gibb also recalls, \"People crying out for help. Desperate songs. Those are the ones that become giants. The minute you capture that on record, it's gold. 'Stayin' Alive' is the epitome of that. Everybody struggles against the world, fighting all the bullshit and things that can drag you down. And it really is a victory just to survive. But when you climb back on top and win bigger than ever before, well that's something everybody reacts to everybody\".<ref name=\"everybody\">{{cite book|first= Andrew M\u00f4n |last= Hughes |title= The Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Music Sales Group]] |url= https://books.google.com?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&pg=PT826 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref> \"We'd also written a song called 'Saturday Night'\", Maurice explains, \"But there were so many songs called 'Saturday Night' even [[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|one]] by the [[Bay City Rollers]], so when we rewrote it for the movie, we called it 'Stayin' Alive'.<ref>{{cite book|first= Melinda |last= Bilyeu |first2= Hector |last2= Cook |first3= Andrew M\u00f4n |last3= Hughes |title= The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |publisher= Music Sales Group |year= 2013 |url= https://books.google.com?id=Uzv_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT661 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref>\n\nThe track was finished at [[Criteria Studios]], with [[Maurice Gibb]] laying down a bass line similar to the guitar riff, Barry Gibb and [[Alan Kendall]] on guitar riffs, and [[Blue Weaver]] adding synthesizers. The Boneroo Horns parts were added. Barry sings falsetto on the whole song, except on the line \"life\u2019s going nowhere, somebody help me\".<ref name=\"GB2\"/> \n\nDue to the death of backing drummer [[Dennis Bryon]]'s mother in the middle of the song's sessions, the group first looked for a replacement. The shortage of qualified drummers in the area prompted the group to try a [[drum machine]], but it did not offer satisfactory results.<ref name=\"Shmoop\"/> After listening to the drum track of the already-recorded \"[[Night Fever]]\", the group and producer Albhy Galuten took two bars from that track, rerecorded them as a recurrent loop on a separate tape, and proceeded with sessions for \"Stayin' Alive\". This accounts for the unchanging rhythm throughout the song. As a joke, the group listed the drummer as \"Bernard Lupe\" (a takeoff on session drummer [[Bernard Purdie]]). Mr. Lupe became a highly sought-after drummer\u2014until it was discovered that he did not exist.<ref name=\"GB2\">{{cite web|first= Joseph |last= Brennan |title= Gibb Songs: 1977 |url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/77.html |accessdate= 3 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlbhy Galuten talks about the recording of \"Stayin' Alive\":\n\n{{quote|Barry and I listened carefully to find a bar that felt really good. Everyone knows that it's more about feel than accuracy in drum tracks. We chose a bar that felt so good that we ended up using that same loop on 'Stayin' Alive,' and 'More Than a Woman,' and then again on Barbra Streisand's song 'Woman in Love.' To make the loop, we copied the drums onto one-quarter-inch tape. Karl spliced the tape and jury rigged it so that it was going over a mic stand and around a plastic reel. At first, we were doing it just as a temporary measure. As we started to lay tracks down to it, we found that it felt really great-very insistent but not machinelike. It had a human feel. By the time we had overdubbed all the parts to the songs and Dennis came back, there was no way we could get rid of the loop.<ref name=\"loop\">{{cite web|first= Mark |last= Small |title= Albhy Galuten tells his story |date= Summer 2002 |publisher= Brothersgibb.org |url= http://www.brothersgibb.org/reports-albhy-galuten.html |accessdate= 27 January 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nIn their work together, Gibb and Galuten had tried playing with a [[click track]] as Galuten explained:\n\n{{quote|While today's musicians know how to get a good groove with the click, back then, if you used a click track you rarely got a good feel. The loop crossed the boundary giving us music that was in time with a good feel. If I had been working for a technology company then and knew what I was doing, I would have tried to patent the idea. Nonetheless, it changed a lot of things. That first loop was a watershed event in our life and times.<ref name=\"loop\"/>}}\n\n==Release==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}\nThe song was not initially scheduled for release, with \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" selected as lead single, but fans called radio stations and [[RSO Records]] requesting the song immediately after seeing trailers for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', featuring the track over the aforementioned introductory scene. The single was eventually released in mid-December, a month after the album, and moved to the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in February, where it would stay for four weeks. Soon after, it would slide to number two, locking in a solid one-two punch with the Bee Gees's third smash hit from the album, \"Night Fever\". In the United Kingdom, \"Stayin' Alive\" was not as popular as it was in the United States, but was still a huge hit, topping out at number four.\n\nFurther demonstrating the Bee Gees's US chart domination in 1978, \"Stayin' Alive\" was replaced at number one with the group's younger brother [[Andy Gibb]]'s single, \"[[(Love Is) Thicker Than Water|Love Is Thicker Than Water]]\", followed by the Bee Gees's \"Night Fever\" for their longest run, seven weeks. This was then replaced by [[Yvonne Elliman]]'s \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\". [[Barry Gibb]] had a hand in writing all four of these songs, becoming the only person in history to write four successive US number-one singles. Besides the version that appeared on the soundtrack album and the edited 45RPM single for Top 40 radio release, there was yet another version, from the same recording session but of a slightly different mix, that was distributed on twelve-inch vinyl to club DJs and radio stations that specialised in airing longer versions of hit songs. This \"Special Disco Version\", as it was called, featured all the same parts as the album version but had a horn rhythm section part interjected twice. Although twelve-inch \"Disco Versions\" were usually sped up, this version was slowed down slightly. This version was finally released on CD when Reprise re-issued ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]'' in 2007 in an expanded and remastered edition. As for the message of the song, Robin Gibb was quoted as saying, \"'Stayin' Alive' is about survival in the big city\u2014any big city\u2014but especially New York.\" The longest version of \"Stayin' Alive\" ever made was faded at 6:59, and that version was finally released on the remastered version of ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]''. The album edit is a still generous 4:43, but it was down to 3:29 for the single version.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nInitial plans were for [[Yvonne Elliman]], then known for ballads, to record \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" for ''Saturday Night Fever'', while the Bee Gees produced their own version of the more disco-oriented \"If I Can't Have You\" for the film. Robert Stigwood thought he would prefer the songs from different genders and directed the group to cut the ballad, while Elliman cut \"If I Can't Have You\" with her usual producer [[Freddie Perren]]. Satisfied with this switch, Elliman's interpretation made the soundtrack, while the Bee Gees's version was relegated to the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Stayin' Alive\" single. The brothers' version has since appeared on CD in hits compilations.\n\n[[George Martin]] commented about this song saying: \"The great thing about 'Stayin' Alive' is that it had a great [[guitar]] hook to start with which set up the theme, that pulsating beat. It's no coincidence, by the way, that the disco beat of 120 beats per minute coincides the heartbeat of your heart when you're excited. This was a key thing which underlined the whole tune, and when the vocals came in, the vocals were so designed that they pushed that beat further\".<ref name=\"everybody\"/>\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video for the song is of an entirely different concept from ''Saturday Night Fever''. It was filmed on [[Sony Pictures Studios|MGM Studios]]'s backlot #2 in [[Culver City, California]]. The group was filming the movie, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' on the lot at the same time. The video featured Quality Street\u2014a set that was used for such films as ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''\u2014as well as the Grand Central Station set used in the films ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' and the opening of ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' with [[Fred Astaire]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Steven |last= Bingen |year= 2011 |title= MGM: Hollywood's Greatest Backlot |isbn= 9781595808936 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pKePBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> As the group walks past one of the railway cars in the video, the words \"New York Central\" can be seen printed on the side of the train above a passenger window. The MGM art directors added this bit of authenticity because the actual [[New York Central Railroad]] operated several lines from [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]] during the 20th century until 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Streamline Steam Engine Attains High Speed |date= February 1935 |page= 211 |magazine= [[Popular Mechanics]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yN8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA211}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Barry Gibb]] \u2013 [[Lead vocalist|lead]], [[Backing vocalist|harmony]] and backing vocals, [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Robin Gibb]] \u2013 harmony and backing vocals\n*[[Maurice Gibb]] \u2013 harmony and backing vocals, [[Bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Alan Kendall]] \u2013 [[lead guitar]]\n*[[Dennis Bryon]] (Bernard Lupe) \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n*[[Blue Weaver]] \u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[synthesizer]]\n*[[Joe Lala]] \u2013 [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n\n==Track listing==\n*\"Stayin' Alive\" \u2013 3:29\n*\"If I Can't Have You\" \u2013 3:25\n\n===1989 reissue===\n*\"Subway\" \u2013 4:20\n*\"Love So Right\" \u2013 3:33\n\n==Use in medical training==\n\"Stayin' Alive\" was used in a study to train medical professionals to provide the correct number of chest compressions per minute while performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]].

The song was released on 13 December 1977 as the second single from the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack. The band co-produced the song with [[Albhy Galuten]] and Karl Richardson. It is one of the Bee Gees' [[signature song]]s. In 2004, \"Stayin' Alive\" was placed at number 189 on the list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=\"RS\"/> In 2004, it ranked No. 9 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema. In a UK television poll on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in December 2011 it was voted fifth in \"''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song]]''\".<ref>\"The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song\". [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 9 December 2011.</ref>\n\nOn its release, \"Stayin' Alive\" climbed the charts to hit the number one spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week of 4 February 1978, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. In the process, it became one of the band's most recognisable tunes, in part because of its place at the beginning of ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. In the United States, it would become the second of six consecutive number-one singles, tying the record with [[the Beatles]] for most consecutive number ones in the United States at the time (a record broken by [[Whitney Houston]] who achieved seven consecutive number-ones).\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nThe [[Record producer|executive producer]] of the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' motion picture soundtrack]] and future Bee Gees manager [[Robert Stigwood]] asked the band to write a few songs for the soundtrack. At this point, the film was in early stages and it did not have a title; in fact, all Stigwood had to go on was a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' cover story about [[disco]]mania. \n\nThey wrote \"Stayin' Alive\" over the course of a few days while sprawled on the staircase at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studio near Paris. As with many other artists during the 1970s, the Bee Gees recorded a majority of the soundtrack in France for tax reasons.\n\n[[RSO Records]] wanted the song to share the then-title of the film, \"Saturday Night\", but the Bee Gees refused a title change, insisting that there had been too many songs with \"Saturday\" in the title, and the album already had a song with the word \"night\" in the title\u2014\"Night Fever\". Rather than change the name of the former song to match the film, Stigwood expanded the name of the film to encompass the title of the latter song. Over the years, the brothers have had mixed feelings about the song. On one hand, they admit it brought them tremendous fame; on the other, it led to their being pigeonholed as a disco act, despite a long and varied career before and after.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nSeveral words from [[Robin Gibb]]'s [[Concorde]] ticket inspired the Gibbs{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to write the lyrics for \"Stayin' Alive\". Robin recalls, \"The subject matter of 'Stayin' Alive' is actually quite a serious one; It's about survival in the streets of [[New York City|New York]], and the lyrics actually say that\". Barry Gibb also recalls, \"People crying out for help. Desperate songs. Those are the ones that become giants. The minute you capture that on record, it's gold. 'Stayin' Alive' is the epitome of that. Everybody struggles against the world, fighting all the bullshit and things that can drag you down. And it really is a victory just to survive. But when you climb back on top and win bigger than ever before, well that's something everybody reacts to everybody\".<ref name=\"everybody\">{{cite book|first= Andrew M\u00f4n |last= Hughes |title= The Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Music Sales Group]] |url= https://books.google.com?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&pg=PT826 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref> \"We'd also written a song called 'Saturday Night'\", Maurice explains, \"But there were so many songs called 'Saturday Night' even [[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|one]] by the [[Bay City Rollers]], so when we rewrote it for the movie, we called it 'Stayin' Alive'.<ref>{{cite book|first= Melinda |last= Bilyeu |first2= Hector |last2= Cook |first3= Andrew M\u00f4n |last3= Hughes |title= The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |publisher= Music Sales Group |year= 2013 |url= https://books.google.com?id=Uzv_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT661 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref>\n\nThe track was finished at [[Criteria Studios]], with [[Maurice Gibb]] laying down a bass line similar to the guitar riff, Barry Gibb and [[Alan Kendall]] on guitar riffs, and [[Blue Weaver]] adding synthesizers. The Boneroo Horns parts were added. Barry sings falsetto on the whole song, except on the line \"life\u2019s going nowhere, somebody help me\".<ref name=\"GB2\"/> \n\nDue to the death of backing drummer [[Dennis Bryon]]'s mother in the middle of the song's sessions, the group first looked for a replacement. The shortage of qualified drummers in the area prompted the group to try a [[drum machine]], but it did not offer satisfactory results.<ref name=\"Shmoop\"/> After listening to the drum track of the already-recorded \"[[Night Fever]]\", the group and producer Albhy Galuten took two bars from that track, rerecorded them as a recurrent loop on a separate tape, and proceeded with sessions for \"Stayin' Alive\". This accounts for the unchanging rhythm throughout the song. As a joke, the group listed the drummer as \"Bernard Lupe\" (a takeoff on session drummer [[Bernard Purdie]]). Mr. Lupe became a highly sought-after drummer\u2014until it was discovered that he did not exist.<ref name=\"GB2\">{{cite web|first= Joseph |last= Brennan |title= Gibb Songs: 1977 |url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/77.html |accessdate= 3 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlbhy Galuten talks about the recording of \"Stayin' Alive\":\n\n{{quote|Barry and I listened carefully to find a bar that felt really good. Everyone knows that it's more about feel than accuracy in drum tracks. We chose a bar that felt so good that we ended up using that same loop on 'Stayin' Alive,' and 'More Than a Woman,' and then again on Barbra Streisand's song 'Woman in Love.' To make the loop, we copied the drums onto one-quarter-inch tape. Karl spliced the tape and jury rigged it so that it was going over a mic stand and around a plastic reel. At first, we were doing it just as a temporary measure. As we started to lay tracks down to it, we found that it felt really great-very insistent but not machinelike. It had a human feel. By the time we had overdubbed all the parts to the songs and Dennis came back, there was no way we could get rid of the loop.<ref name=\"loop\">{{cite web|first= Mark |last= Small |title= Albhy Galuten tells his story |date= Summer 2002 |publisher= Brothersgibb.org |url= http://www.brothersgibb.org/reports-albhy-galuten.html |accessdate= 27 January 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nIn their work together, Gibb and Galuten had tried playing with a [[click track]] as Galuten explained:\n\n{{quote|While today's musicians know how to get a good groove with the click, back then, if you used a click track you rarely got a good feel. The loop crossed the boundary giving us music that was in time with a good feel. If I had been working for a technology company then and knew what I was doing, I would have tried to patent the idea. Nonetheless, it changed a lot of things. That first loop was a watershed event in our life and times.<ref name=\"loop\"/>}}\n\n==Release==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}\nThe song was not initially scheduled for release, with \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" selected as lead single, but fans called radio stations and [[RSO Records]] requesting the song immediately after seeing trailers for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', featuring the track over the aforementioned introductory scene. The single was eventually released in mid-December, a month after the album, and moved to the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in February, where it would stay for four weeks. Soon after, it would slide to number two, locking in a solid one-two punch with the Bee Gees's third smash hit from the album, \"Night Fever\". In the United Kingdom, \"Stayin' Alive\" was not as popular as it was in the United States, but was still a huge hit, topping out at number four.\n\nFurther demonstrating the Bee Gees's US chart domination in 1978, \"Stayin' Alive\" was replaced at number one with the group's younger brother [[Andy Gibb]]'s single, \"[[(Love Is) Thicker Than Water|Love Is Thicker Than Water]]\", followed by the Bee Gees's \"Night Fever\" for their longest run, seven weeks. This was then replaced by [[Yvonne Elliman]]'s \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\". [[Barry Gibb]] had a hand in writing all four of these songs, becoming the only person in history to write four successive US number-one singles. Besides the version that appeared on the soundtrack album and the edited 45RPM single for Top 40 radio release, there was yet another version, from the same recording session but of a slightly different mix, that was distributed on twelve-inch vinyl to club DJs and radio stations that specialised in airing longer versions of hit songs. This \"Special Disco Version\", as it was called, featured all the same parts as the album version but had a horn rhythm section part interjected twice. Although twelve-inch \"Disco Versions\" were usually sped up, this version was slowed down slightly. This version was finally released on CD when Reprise re-issued ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]'' in 2007 in an expanded and remastered edition. As for the message of the song, Robin Gibb was quoted as saying, \"'Stayin' Alive' is about survival in the big city\u2014any big city\u2014but especially New York.\" The longest version of \"Stayin' Alive\" ever made was faded at 6:59, and that version was finally released on the remastered version of ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]''. The album edit is a still generous 4:43, but it was down to 3:29 for the single version.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nInitial plans were for [[Yvonne Elliman]], then known for ballads, to record \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" for ''Saturday Night Fever'', while the Bee Gees produced their own version of the more disco-oriented \"If I Can't Have You\" for the film. Robert Stigwood thought he would prefer the songs from different genders and directed the group to cut the ballad, while Elliman cut \"If I Can't Have You\" with her usual producer [[Freddie Perren]]. Satisfied with this switch, Elliman's interpretation made the soundtrack, while the Bee Gees's version was relegated to the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Stayin' Alive\" single. The brothers' version has since appeared on CD in hits compilations.\n\n[[George Martin]] commented about this song saying: \"The great thing about 'Stayin' Alive' is that it had a great [[guitar]] hook to start with which set up the theme, that pulsating beat. It's no coincidence, by the way, that the disco beat of 120 beats per minute coincides the heartbeat of your heart when you're excited. This was a key thing which underlined the whole tune, and when the vocals came in, the vocals were so designed that they pushed that beat further\".<ref name=\"everybody\"/>\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video for the song is of an entirely different concept from ''Saturday Night Fever''. It was filmed on [[Sony Pictures Studios|MGM Studios]]'s backlot #2 in [[Culver City, California]]. The group was filming the movie, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' on the lot at the same time. The video featured Quality Street\u2014a set that was used for such films as ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''\u2014as well as the Grand Central Station set used in the films ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' and the opening of ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' with [[Fred Astaire]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Steven |last= Bingen |year= 2011 |title= MGM: Hollywood's Greatest Backlot |isbn= 9781595808936 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pKePBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> As the group walks past one of the railway cars in the video, the words \"New York Central\" can be seen printed on the side of the train above a passenger window.
