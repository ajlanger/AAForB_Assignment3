In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both [[analog signal|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] representations. A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical [[Palette (computing)|color swatches]] and corresponding assigned [[color name]]s or numbers (such as with the [[Pantone]] collection), or structured mathematically (as with the [[Natural Color System|NCS System]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]] and [[sRGB]]). \n\nA \"[[color model]]\" is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as [[tuple]]s of numbers (e.g. triples in [[RGB color model|RGB]] or quadruples in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an [[#absolute color space|absolute color space]] is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite \"footprint\", known as a <dfn>[[gamut]]</dfn>, and for a given color model this defines a color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.

However, even though identifying a color space automatically identifies the associated color model, this usage is incorrect in a strict sense.

This image demonstrates the difference between how colors will look on a computer monitor (RGB) compared to how they will reproduce in a CMYK print process.]]\n\nColors can be created in [[printing]] with [[color]] spaces based on the [[CMYK color model]], using the subtractive [[primary colors]] of [[pigment]] ([[cyan|'''c'''yan]], [[magenta|'''m'''agenta]], [[yellow|'''y'''ellow]], and [[black|blac'''k''']]). To create a three-dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X [[coordinate axis|axis]], the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments.\n\nColors can be created on [[computer monitor]]s with color spaces based on the [[RGB color model]], using the additive primary colors ([[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]).  A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes.  Note that colors generated on given monitor will be limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (in a [[CRT monitor]]) or filters and backlight ([[LCD]] monitor).\n\nAnother way of creating colors on a monitor is with an [[HSL and HSV|HSL or HSV]] color space, based on [[hue]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]] (value/brightness).  With such a space, the variables are assigned to [[cylindrical coordinates]].\n\nMany color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone]], cannot be represented in this way at all.\n\n==Conversion==\n{{main|Color translation}}\nColor space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original.\n\n==RGB density==\n\nThe RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is the 24-[[bit]] implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per [[channel (digital image)|channel]]. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 \u2248 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same [[gamut]] with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different [[Color depth|bit depths]].\n\n==Lists==\n{{main|List of color spaces and their uses}}\n[[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]] was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], K\u00f6nig & Dieterici, and Abney at [[Imperial College]])<ref name=\"Wright1981\">William David Wright, ''50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer''. Die Farbe, '''29''':4/6 (1981).</ref> and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIERGB]] color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the  [[CIELUV]], [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]], and [[CIELAB]].\n\n===Generic===\n{{main|Color model}}\n[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing: Three overlapping light bulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white.]]\n[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black.]]\n\n[[RGB color space|RGB]] uses [[additive color]] mixing, because it describes what kind of ''light'' needs to be ''emitted'' to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency. Common color spaces based on the RGB model include [[sRGB]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]], [[ProPhoto RGB color space|ProPhoto RGB]], [[scRGB]], and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIE RGB]].\n\n[[CMYK]] uses [[subtractive color]] mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of [[ink]]s need to be applied so the light ''reflected'' from the [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).\n\n[[YIQ]] was formerly used in [[NTSC]] (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a [[Luma (video)|luma]] value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)<ref>Charles Poynton, \"YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video,\" [http://poynton.com/papers/YUV_and_luminance_harmful.html online],  author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, ''Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces'', Morgan\u2013Kaufmann, 2003.

The [[YDbDr]] scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. <!--\nIt would be nice if someone could find out how exactly the YDbDr color system is rotated.\n-->\n\n[[YPbPr]] is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, [[YCbCr]], used widely in [[Video compression|video]] and [[image compression]] schemes such as [[MPEG]] and [[JPEG]].\n\n[[xvYCC]] is a new international digital video color space standard published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and [[Rec. 709|BT.709]] standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards.\n\n[[HSV color space|HSV]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''v'''alue), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, '''b'''rightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived.\n\n[[HSL color space|HSL]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''l'''ightness/'''l'''uminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, '''i'''ntensity) is quite similar to [[HSV color space|HSV]], with \"lightness\" replacing \"brightness\". The difference is that the ''brightness'' of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the ''lightness'' of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.\n\n===Commercial===\n\n* [[Munsell color system]]\n* [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone Matching System (PMS)]]\n* [[Natural Color System|Natural Color System (NCS)]]\n\n===Special-purpose===\n\n* The [[RG Chromaticity]] space is used in [[computer vision]] applications.

For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute.  The [[CIELAB color space|CIE 1976 L*, a*, b* color space]] is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a [[white point]] specification to make it so.<ref>{{cite book | title = Optical Sensors and Sensing Systems for Natural Resources and Food Safety and Quality |author1=Yud-Ren Chen |author2=George E.

This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]]. The process of adding an [[ICC profile]] to a graphic or document is sometimes called ''tagging'' or ''embedding''; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document.\n\n===Conversion===\n{{main|Color translation}}\nA color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have [[gamut]] limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component ([[8-bit color]]) is used.\n\nOne part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting.\n\nOccasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, [[HSL and HSV]] spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept.\n\n===Arbitrary spaces===\nA different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the [[Pantone|Pantone Matching System]], a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Color model]]\n* [[List of colors]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Color spaces}}\n* [http://www.poynton.com/ColorFAQ.html Color FAQ], Charles Poynton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020802012056/http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/color.html Color Science], Dan Bruton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081015235156/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rgkuehni/PDFs/ColSp.pdf Color Spaces], Rolf G.

The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different [[Color depth|bit depths]].\n\n==Lists==\n{{main|List of color spaces and their uses}}\n[[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]] was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], K\u00f6nig & Dieterici, and Abney at [[Imperial College]])<ref name=\"Wright1981\">William David Wright, ''50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer''. Die Farbe, '''29''':4/6 (1981).</ref> and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIERGB]] color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the  [[CIELUV]], [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]], and [[CIELAB]].\n\n===Generic===\n{{main|Color model}}\n[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing: Three overlapping light bulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white.]]\n[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black.]]\n\n[[RGB color space|RGB]] uses [[additive color]] mixing, because it describes what kind of ''light'' needs to be ''emitted'' to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency. Common color spaces based on the RGB model include [[sRGB]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]], [[ProPhoto RGB color space|ProPhoto RGB]], [[scRGB]], and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIE RGB]].\n\n[[CMYK]] uses [[subtractive color]] mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of [[ink]]s need to be applied so the light ''reflected'' from the [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).\n\n[[YIQ]] was formerly used in [[NTSC]] (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a [[Luma (video)|luma]] value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)<ref>Charles Poynton, \"YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video,\" [http://poynton.com/papers/YUV_and_luminance_harmful.html online],  author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, ''Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces'', Morgan\u2013Kaufmann, 2003.

The [[YDbDr]] scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. <!--\nIt would be nice if someone could find out how exactly the YDbDr color system is rotated.\n-->\n\n[[YPbPr]] is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, [[YCbCr]], used widely in [[Video compression|video]] and [[image compression]] schemes such as [[MPEG]] and [[JPEG]].\n\n[[xvYCC]] is a new international digital video color space standard published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and [[Rec. 709|BT.709]] standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards.\n\n[[HSV color space|HSV]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''v'''alue), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, '''b'''rightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived.\n\n[[HSL color space|HSL]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''l'''ightness/'''l'''uminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, '''i'''ntensity) is quite similar to [[HSV color space|HSV]], with \"lightness\" replacing \"brightness\". The difference is that the ''brightness'' of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the ''lightness'' of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.\n\n===Commercial===\n\n* [[Munsell color system]]\n* [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone Matching System (PMS)]]\n* [[Natural Color System|Natural Color System (NCS)]]\n\n===Special-purpose===\n\n* The [[RG Chromaticity]] space is used in [[computer vision]] applications.

For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute.  The [[CIELAB color space|CIE 1976 L*, a*, b* color space]] is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a [[white point]] specification to make it so.<ref>{{cite book | title = Optical Sensors and Sensing Systems for Natural Resources and Food Safety and Quality |author1=Yud-Ren Chen |author2=George E. Meyer |author3=Shu-I.

This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]]. The process of adding an [[ICC profile]] to a graphic or document is sometimes called ''tagging'' or ''embedding''; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document.\n\n===Conversion===\n{{main|Color translation}}\nA color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have [[gamut]] limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component ([[8-bit color]]) is used.\n\nOne part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting.\n\nOccasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, [[HSL and HSV]] spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept.\n\n===Arbitrary spaces===\nA different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the [[Pantone|Pantone Matching System]], a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Color model]]\n* [[List of colors]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Color spaces}}\n* [http://www.poynton.com/ColorFAQ.html Color FAQ], Charles Poynton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020802012056/http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/color.html Color Science], Dan Bruton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081015235156/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rgkuehni/PDFs/ColSp.pdf Color Spaces], Rolf G.
