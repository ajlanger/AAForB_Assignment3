The NCAA did not immediately record assists throughout women's college basketball when it began sanctioning women's sports in the 1981\u201382 school year; it began recording assists in Division I in 1985\u201386.\n\nThe all-time leader in career assists is [[Suzie McConnell-Serio|Suzie McConnell]] of [[Penn State Lady Lions basketball|Penn State]]. She recorded 1,307&nbsp;assists in 128&nbsp;games (10.21 per game average) between 1984\u201385 and 1987\u201388. Second on the list is [[Andrea Nagy]] of [[FIU Panthers women's basketball|FIU]], who compiled 1,165&nbsp;assists. Only three other women have recorded 1,000 career assists at the Division&nbsp;I level: [[Courtney Vandersloot]] of [[Gonzaga Bulldogs women's basketball|Gonzaga]] (1,118), Tine Freil of [[Pacific Tigers women's basketball|Pacific]] (1,088), and [[Sabrina Ionescu]] of [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]] (1,064 through March 1, 2020).\n\nAll but one of the players listed compiled their totals in the standard four seasons. The exception is Neacole Hall of [[Alabama State Lady Hornets basketball|Alabama State]], who compiled 869 assists despite playing only three seasons in Division I (1986\u201387 to 1988\u201389).
