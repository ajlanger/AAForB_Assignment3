Given the city-state's compact size, most venues were pre-existing public-sporting facilities located in the suburban heartlands which were reverted to public use after the games. No major retrofitting work were done in most venues as most had been used to host major multi-disciplinary events such as the [[2010 Youth Olympic Games]].\n\nAt the centrepiece of the activities was the [[Singapore Sports Hub]] which was completed in mid-2014. Incorporating the new 55,000-seat national stadium, it hosted most of the events.\n\nA games village was not built. Instead, a \"village in the city\" concept saw athletes and officials housed in 20 hotels in downtown Singapore. Besides being physically near to the Singapore Sports Hub, it was hoped that it will add vibe to the city and reduce post-games costs in converting a dedicated games village to other uses.\n\nThe '''28th [[Southeast Asian Games]]''' had 30 venues for the games.\n\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:left; font-size:100%; border:2px solid blue;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; color:white; font-weight:bold; background:red;\"\n| Cluster\n| Competition Venue\n| Sports\n|-\n!rowspan=13|[[Kallang|Kallang Cluster]]\n!colspan=2|[[Singapore Sports Hub]]\n|-\n|[[Singapore National Stadium]]\n|Opening & Closing ceremony, Athletics, Football\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 1\n|Netball, Basketball\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 2\n|Fencing, Volleyball (Indoor)\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 4\n|Billiards & snooker\n|-\n|[[Singapore Indoor Stadium]]\n|Table tennis, Badminton\n|-\n|OCBC Aquatic Centre\n|Aquatics: Diving, Swimming, Synchronised swimming, Waterpolo\n|-\n!colspan=2|Other\n|-\n|Kallang Squash Centre\n|Squash: Singles & team\n|-\n|[[Kallang Tennis Centre]]\n|Tennis\n|-\n|Kallang Cricket Field\n|Archery\n|-\n|Kallang Softball Field\n|Softball\n|-\n|Kallang Practice Track\n|Athletics: Marathon\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Singapore Expo]]\n|Expo Hall 1\n|Boxing, Sepaktakraw\n|-\n|Expo Hall 2\n|Judo, Pencak silat, Taekwondo, Wushu\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Marina Cluster\n|[[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]\n|Traditional Boat Race, Sailing: Keelboat\n|-\n|[[Marina South|Marina Bay South]]\n|Cycling\n|-\n|Marina Channel\n|Canoeing, Rowing\n|-\n!rowspan=17|Other\n|-\n| [[Bedok Reservoir]] || Water Ski<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[Bishan Sports Hall]] || Gymnastics\n|-\n| [[Bishan Stadium]] || Football<ref name=\"Competition venues\">{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/tdysports/status/560323615422304256/photo/1 |title=Competition venues for SEA Games |work=Singapore News |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Jalan Besar Stadium]] || Football\n|-\n| [[Choa Chu Kang Stadium]] || Rugby sevens<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[East Coast Park]] ||Athletics: 20&nbsp;km walk, Triathlon\n|-\n| [[ITE College Central|ITE Central]] || Floorball\n|-\n| [[National Sailing Centre]] || Sailing\n|-\n| [[National Shooting Centre]] || Shooting (Outdoors)\n|-\n| Orchid Country Club || Bowling\n|-\n| [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] || P\u00e9tanque\n|-\n| [[Sengkang Hockey Stadium]] || Field hockey\n|-\n| Sentosa Golf Club ||Golf\n|-\n| [[Singapore Turf Club|Turf Club Riding Centre]] || Equestrian\n|-\n| [[Tanglin Club]] || Squash: Jumbo double\n|-\n| SAFRA Yishun || Shooting (Indoors)\n|}\n\n===Public transport===\nGiven the existing extensive public transport network already in place, there is no games-specific major infrastructural development to support it.

Megat Zulkarnain Omardin was dissatisfied with what he said was an unfair ruling by the event's chairman of the jury in the semifinal match between Mohd Fauzi Khalid of [[Malaysia at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games|Malaysia]] and Muhd Nur Alfian Juma'en of [[Singapore at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games|Singapore]], the host nation.<ref name=\"malaysia dissatisfaction\">{{cite

win)|language=Malay|publisher=[[Sinar Harian]]|date=14 June 2015|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> At the final moments of the last round, Muhd Nur Alfian made a controversial drop on Mohd Fauzi which was later deemed to be valid after consultation with the chairman as well as with the panel of five jury members. Megat Zulkarnain said that after watching video replays of the drop, the drop should not have counted as Mohd Fauzi was pulled down instead of being dropped legally according to the regulations, and thus Malaysia should have won the match instead. He felt that the eventual decision to award the match to Singapore's Muhd Nur Alfian was just so as to maintain the dignity of the home nation's pencak silat, which was widely criticised by many nations.<ref name=\"malaysia dissatisfaction\"/>\n*During the closing ceremony, spectators were shuffled from gate to gate in order to enter through a gate with fewer people resulting in them not being able to watch the ceremony. Some spectators were also told that the stadium was full.

Given the city-state's compact size, most venues were pre-existing public-sporting facilities located in the suburban heartlands which were reverted to public use after the games. No major retrofitting work were done in most venues as most had been used to host major multi-disciplinary events such as the [[2010 Youth Olympic Games]].\n\nAt the centrepiece of the activities was the [[Singapore Sports Hub]] which was completed in mid-2014. Incorporating the new 55,000-seat national stadium, it hosted most of the events.\n\nA games village was not built. Instead, a \"village in the city\" concept saw athletes and officials housed in 20 hotels in downtown Singapore. Besides being physically near to the Singapore Sports Hub, it was hoped that it will add vibe to the city and reduce post-games costs in converting a dedicated games village to other uses.\n\nThe '''28th [[Southeast Asian Games]]''' had 30 venues for the games.\n\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:left; font-size:100%; border:2px solid blue;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; color:white; font-weight:bold; background:red;\"\n| Cluster\n| Competition Venue\n| Sports\n|-\n!rowspan=13|[[Kallang|Kallang Cluster]]\n!colspan=2|[[Singapore Sports Hub]]\n|-\n|[[Singapore National Stadium]]\n|Opening & Closing ceremony, Athletics, Football\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 1\n|Netball, Basketball\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 2\n|Fencing, Volleyball (Indoor)\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 4\n|Billiards & snooker\n|-\n|[[Singapore Indoor Stadium]]\n|Table tennis, Badminton\n|-\n|OCBC Aquatic Centre\n|Aquatics: Diving, Swimming, Synchronised swimming, Waterpolo\n|-\n!colspan=2|Other\n|-\n|Kallang Squash Centre\n|Squash: Singles & team\n|-\n|[[Kallang Tennis Centre]]\n|Tennis\n|-\n|Kallang Cricket Field\n|Archery\n|-\n|Kallang Softball Field\n|Softball\n|-\n|Kallang Practice Track\n|Athletics: Marathon\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Singapore Expo]]\n|Expo Hall 1\n|Boxing, Sepaktakraw\n|-\n|Expo Hall 2\n|Judo, Pencak silat, Taekwondo, Wushu\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Marina Cluster\n|[[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]\n|Traditional Boat Race, Sailing: Keelboat\n|-\n|[[Marina South|Marina Bay South]]\n|Cycling\n|-\n|Marina Channel\n|Canoeing, Rowing\n|-\n!rowspan=17|Other\n|-\n| [[Bedok Reservoir]] || Water Ski<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[Bishan Sports Hall]] || Gymnastics\n|-\n| [[Bishan Stadium]] || Football<ref name=\"Competition venues\">{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/tdysports/status/560323615422304256/photo/1 |title=Competition venues for SEA Games |work=Singapore News |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Jalan Besar Stadium]] || Football\n|-\n| [[Choa Chu Kang Stadium]] || Rugby sevens<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[East Coast Park]] ||Athletics: 20&nbsp;km walk, Triathlon\n|-\n| [[ITE College Central|ITE Central]] || Floorball\n|-\n| [[National Sailing Centre]] || Sailing\n|-\n| [[National Shooting Centre]] || Shooting (Outdoors)\n|-\n| Orchid Country Club || Bowling\n|-\n| [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] || P\u00e9tanque\n|-\n| [[Sengkang Hockey Stadium]] || Field hockey\n|-\n| Sentosa Golf Club ||Golf\n|-\n| [[Singapore Turf Club|Turf Club Riding Centre]] || Equestrian\n|-\n| [[Tanglin Club]] || Squash: Jumbo double\n|-\n| SAFRA Yishun || Shooting (Indoors)\n|}\n\n===Public transport===\nGiven the existing extensive public transport network already in place, there is no games-specific major infrastructural development to support it.

Southeast Asian Games|Malaysia]] and Muhd Nur Alfian Juma'en of [[Singapore at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games|Singapore]], the host nation.<ref name=\"malaysia dissatisfaction\">{{cite

was later deemed to be valid after consultation with the chairman as well as with the panel of five jury members. Megat Zulkarnain said that after watching video replays of the drop, the drop should not have counted as Mohd Fauzi was pulled down instead of being dropped legally according to the regulations, and thus Malaysia should have won the match instead. He felt that the eventual decision to award the match to Singapore's Muhd Nur Alfian was just so as to maintain the dignity of the home nation's pencak silat, which was widely criticized by many nations.<ref name=\"malaysia dissatisfaction\"/>\n*During the closing ceremony, spectators were shuffled from gate to gate in order to enter through a gate with fewer people resulting in them not being able to watch the ceremony.
