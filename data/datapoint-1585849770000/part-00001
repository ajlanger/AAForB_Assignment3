The new guidelines took effect in January 2009.\"<ref name=\"Phrmacode\">{{cite web |url=http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/phrma_marketing_code_2008.pdf |title=Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to prohibiting small gifts and reminder items such as pens, notepads, staplers, clipboards, paperweights, pill boxes, etc.,<ref name=\"Phrmacode\" /> the revised Code:\n# Prohibits company sales representatives providing restaurant meals to healthcare professionals, but allows them to provide occasional modest meals in healthcare professionals\u2019 offices in conjunction with informational presentations\"<ref name=\"Phrmacode\" />\n# Includes new provisions requiring companies to ensure their representatives are sufficiently trained about applicable laws, regulations, and industry codes of practice and ethics.<ref name=\"Phrmacode\" />\n# Provides that each company will state its intentions to abide by the Code and that company CEOs and compliance officers will certify each year that they have processes in place to comply.<ref name=\"Phrmacode\" />\n# Includes more detailed standards regarding the independence of continuing medical education.<ref name=\"Phrmacode\" />\n# Provides additional guidance and restrictions for speaking and consulting arrangements with healthcare professionals.<ref name=\"Phrmacode\" />\n\n===Free samples===\nFree samples have been shown to affect physician prescribing behaviour.  Physicians with access to free samples are more likely to prescribe brand name medication over equivalent generic medications.<ref name=Women08/>  Other studies found that free samples decreased the likelihood that physicians would follow standard of care practices.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nReceiving pharmaceutical samples does not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander GC, Zhang J, Basu A | year = 2008 | title = Characteristics of patients receiving pharmaceutical samples and association between sample receipt and out-of-pocket prescription costs | url = | journal = Medical Care | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 394\u2013402 | pmid = 18362819 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181618ee0}}</ref>\n\nIt is argued that a benefit to free samples is the \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d approach. Free samples give immediate access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away.  Also, it saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, free samples allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having to spend money on a filled prescription at a [[pharmacy]].<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n===Continuing medical education===\nHours spent by physicians in industry-supported [[continuing medical education]] (CME) is greater than that from either [[medical school]]s or professional societies.<ref name=Women08/>\n\n===Pharmaceutical representatives===\nCurrently, there are approximately 81,000 [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zsassociates.com/news_events/news_media/the_doctor_wont_see_you_mr_pharma_rep_now/ |title=ZS Associates; Pharmaceutical |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> pursuing some 830,000 pharmaceutical prescribers. A pharmaceutical representative will often try to see a given physician every few weeks. Representatives often have a call list of about 200\u2013300 physicians with 120\u2013180 targets that should be visited in 1\u20132 or 3 week cycle.\n\nBecause of the large size of the pharmaceutical sales force, the organization, management, and measurement of effectiveness of the sales force are significant business challenges. Management tasks are usually broken down into the areas of physician targeting, sales force size and structure, sales force optimization, call planning, and sales forces effectiveness. A few pharmaceutical companies have realized that training sales representatives on high science alone is not enough, especially when most products are similar in quality.  Thus, training sales representatives on relationship selling techniques in addition to medical science and product knowledge, can make a difference in sales force effectiveness.  Specialist physicians are relying more and more on specialty sales reps for product information, because they are more knowledgeable than primary care reps.\n\nThe United States has 81,000 pharmaceutical representatives or 1 for every 7.9 physicians.<ref name=Women08/> The number and persistence of pharmaceutical  representatives has placed a burden on the time of physicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=177968  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> \"As the  number of reps went up, the amount of time an average rep spent with  doctors went down\u2014so  far down, that tactical scaling has spawned a strategic crisis.  Physicians no longer spend much time with sales reps, nor do they see this as a serious problem.\"\n\nMarketers must  decide on the appropriate size of a sales force needed to sell a  particular portfolio of drugs to the target market. Factors influencing this decision are the optimal reach (how many physicians to see) and frequency (how often to see  them) for each individual physician, how many patients suffer from that disease state, how many sales representatives to devote to office and group practice and how many to devote to hospital accounts if needed. To aid this decision, customers are broken down into different classes according to their prescription behavior, patient population, and of course, their business potential.\n\nMarketers attempt to identify the set of physicians most likely to prescribe a given drug. Historically, this was done by measuring the number of total prescriptions (TRx) and new prescriptions (NRx) per week that each physician writes. This information is collected by commercial vendors. The physicians are then \"deciled\" into ten groups based on their writing patterns. Higher deciles are more aggressively targeted. Some pharmaceutical companies use additional information such as:\n* Profitability of a prescription (script),\n* Accessibility of the physician,\n* Tendency of the physician to use the pharmaceutical company's drugs,\n* Effect of managed care formularies on the ability of the physician to prescribe a drug,\n* The [[adoption sequence]] of the physician (that is, how readily the physician adopts new drugs in place of older treatments), and\n* The tendency of the physician to use a wide palette of drugs\n* Influence that physicians have on their colleagues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kiefer|authorlink1=Kiefer Lee|last2=Carter|first2=Steve|date=2012|title=Global Marketing Management|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=524|isbn=978-0-19-960970-3}}</ref>\n\nPhysicians are perhaps the most important component in  sales. They  write the prescriptions that determine which drugs will be used by  people.  Influencing the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales.  Historically, this was done by a large pharmaceutical sales force. A  medium-sized  pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of 1000  representatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  The largest companies have tens of thousands of representatives around  the world. Sales representatives called upon physicians regularly,  providing clinical information, approved journal articles, and free drug samples. This is still the approach  today; however, economic pressures on the industry are causing  pharmaceutical companies to rethink the traditional sales process to  physicians. The industry has seen a large scale adoption of Pharma CRM systems that works on laptops and more recently [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The new age pharmaceutical representative is armed with key data at his fingertips and tools to maximize the time spent with physicians.\n\n===Peer influence===\n;Key opinion leaders\nKey opinion leaders (KOL), or \"thought leaders\", are  respected individuals, such as prominent medical school faculty, who  influence physicians through their professional status. Pharmaceutical  companies generally engage key opinion leaders early in the drug  development process to provide advocacy and key marketing feedback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharma-mkting.com/glossary/keyopinionleader.htm  |title=Glossary Term: Key Opinion Leader |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some  pharmaceutical companies identify key opinion leaders through direct  inquiry of physicians (primary research).  Recently, pharmaceutical companies have begun to use [[social network analysis]] to uncover thought leaders; because it does not introduce respondent bias, which is commonly found in primary research; it can identify and map out the entire scientific community for a disease state; and it has greater compliance with state and federal regulations; because physician prescribing patterns are not used to create the social network.<ref>http://www.lnxpharma.com/images/pages/Lnx_Whitepaper_1.pdf</ref>\n\nAlternatives  to  segmenting physicians purely on the basis of prescribing do exist,  and  marketers can call upon strategic partners who specialize in   delineating which characteristics of true opinion leadership, a   physician does or does not possess.  Such analyses can help guide   marketers in how to optimize KOL engagements as bona fide advisors to a   brand, and can help shape clinical development and clinical data   publication plans for instance, ultimately advancing patient care.\n\n;Colleagues\nPhysicians  acquire information through informal contacts with their colleagues,  including social events, professional affiliations, common hospital  affiliations, and common medical school affiliations. Some  pharmaceutical companies identify influential colleagues through  commercially available prescription writing and patient level data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=395598  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\nDoctor  dinner meetings are an effective way for physicians to acquire  educational information from respected peers.  These meetings are  sponsored by some pharmaceutical companies.\n\n===Journal articles and technical documentation===\n\nRecent legal cases and US congressional  hearings have provided access to [[Drug Industry Document Archive|pharmaceutical industry documents]]  revealing new marketing strategies for drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/4/284  |title=Narrative Review: The Promotion of Gabapentin: An Analysis of Internal Industry Documents \u2013 Steinman et al. 145 (4): 284 \u2013 Annals of Internal Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Activities  once considered independent of promotional intent, including [[continuing medical education]] and [[medical research]],  are used, including paying to publish articles about promoted drugs for  the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study  results.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/145/4/305?etoc  |title=Safeguarding Patient Welfare: Who's In Charge? \u2013 Henney 145 (4): 305 \u2013 Annals of Internal Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Private and public insurers===\nPublic and private insurers affect the writing of prescriptions by physicians through [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formularies]] that restrict the number and types of drugs that the insurer will cover. Not only can the insurer affect drug sales by including or excluding a particular drug from a formulary, they can affect sales by tiering, or placing bureaucratic hurdles to prescribing certain drugs. In January 2006, the United States instituted a new public prescription drug plan through its [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program. Known as [[Medicare Part&nbsp;D]], this program engages private insurers to negotiate with [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] for the placement of drugs on tiered formularies.\n\n==To consumers==\nOnly two countries as of 2008 allow [[direct to consumer advertising]] (DTCA): the United States and New Zealand.<ref name=\"NYT-20151127\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Women08/> Since the late 1970s, DTCA of prescription drugs has become important in the United States. It takes two main forms: the promotion or creation of a disease out of a non-pathologic physical condition or the promotion of a medication.<ref name=Women08/> The rhetorical objective of direct-to-consumer advertising is to directly influence the patient-physician dialogue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|last2=Balzhiser|first2=Deborah|date=September 2015|title=Pharmaceutical Companies Are Writing the Script for Health Consumerism|journal=Commun.

In some areas it is required that ads for drugs include a list of possible side effects, so that users are informed of both facets of a medicine. [[Canada]]'s limitations on pharmaceutical advertising ensure that commercials that mention the name of a product cannot in any way describe what it does. Commercials that mention a medical problem cannot also mention the name of the product for sale; at most, they can direct the viewer to a website or telephone number operated by the pharmaceutical company.\n\nReynold Spector has provided examples of how positive and negative hype can affect perceptions of pharmaceuticals using examples of certain cancer drugs, such as [[Avastin]] and [[Opdivo]], in the former case and [[statin]]s in the latter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spector |first1=Reynold |title=Drug Therapy Hype: The Misuse of Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=44\u201349}}</ref>\n\n===Drug coupons===\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies often provide [[drug coupon]]s to consumers to help offset the [[copayment]]s charged by health insurers for prescription medication. These coupons are generally used to promote medications that compete with non-preferred products and cheaper, generic alternatives by reducing or eliminating the extra out-of-pocket costs that an insurers typically charge a patient for a non-preferred drug product.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lunzer Kritz|first=Francesca|title=Check out drug coupons, then check bottom line|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/health/he-coupons3|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=3 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Economics==\nPharmaceutical company spending on marketing exceeds that spent on research.<ref name=\"Brezis2008\" /><ref name=Women08/>  In 2004 in Canada $1.7 billion a year was spent marketing drugs to physicians and in the United States $21 billion were spent in 2002.<ref name=McGill04>{{cite web  |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/orig_articles/barfett.pdf  |title=www.medicine.mcgill.ca |format= |website=  |accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2005 money spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States was estimated at $29.9 billion with one estimate as high as $57 billion.<ref name=Women08>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sufrin CB, Ross JS |title=Pharmaceutical industry marketing: understanding its impact on women's health |journal=Obstet Gynecol Surv |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=585\u201396 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18713478 |doi=10.1097/OGX.0b013e31817f1585 |url=}}</ref>  When the US number are broken down 56% was free samples, 25% was detailing of physicians, 12.5% was direct to users advertising, 4% on hospital detailing, and 2% on journal ads.<ref name=McGill04/> In the United States approximately $20 billion could be saved if generics were used instead of equivalent brand name products.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nAlthough pharmaceutical companies have made large investments in marketing their products, overall promotional spending has been decreasing over the last few years, and declined by 10 percent from 2009 to 2010.

[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations require all prescription drug promotion to be truthful and not misleading, based on \"substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience\", to provide a \"fair balance\" between the risks and benefits of the promoted drug, and to maintain consistency with labeling approved by the FDA. The FDA Office of Prescription Drug Promotion enforces these requirements.\n\nIn the 1990s, antipsychotics were \"still seen as treatments for the most serious mental illnesses, like hallucinatory schizophrenia, and recast them for much broader uses\". Drugs such as [[Abilify]] and [[Geodon]] were given to a broad range of patients, from preschoolers to octogenarians. In 2010, more than a half-million youths took antipsychotic drugs, and one-quarter of nursing-home residents have used them. Yet the government warns that the drugs may be fatal to some older patients and have unknown effects on children.<ref name=bied2010/>\n\nEvery major company selling the drugs\u2014[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Johnson & Johnson]]\u2014has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements in 2009 set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly\u2019s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.<ref name=bied2010>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=2 October 2010  |work=[[New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement.

Both physicians  and users are increasing their reliance on the Internet as a source of health and medical information, prompting pharmaceutical marketers to look at digital channels for opportunities to reach their target  audiences.\n\nIn 2008, 84% of U.S. physicians used the  Internet and other technologies to access pharmaceutical, biotech or  medical device information\u2014a 20% increase from 2004. At the same time, sales reps are  finding it more difficult to get time with doctors for in-person details.  Pharmaceutical companies are exploring online marketing as an alternative way to reach physicians. Emerging e-promotional activities include live video detailing, online events, electronic sampling, and physician customer service portals such as PV Updates, MDLinx, Aptus Health (former Physicians Interactive), and [[Epocrates]].\n\nDirect-to-users  marketers are also recognizing the need to shift to digital channels as audiences become more fragmented and the number of access points for news, entertainment and information multiplies. Standard television,  radio and print direct-to-users (DTC) advertisements are less relevant than in the past, and companies  are beginning to focus more on digital marketing efforts like product websites, [[display advertising|online display advertising]], [[search engine marketing]], [[social media]] campaigns, place-based media and [[mobile advertising]] to reach the over 145 million U.S. adults online for health information.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications issued a warning letter concerning two unbranded consumer targeted Web sites sponsored by [[Novartis]] Pharmaceuticals Corporation as the websites promoted a drug for an unapproved use, the websites failed to disclose the risks associated with the use of the drug and made unsubstantiated dosing claims.<ref>{{citation |author=Debra Dunne |title=Unbranded Web Sites: FDA Finds Violative Promotional Practices |date=October 4, 2010 |publisher=Stradley Ronon  |url= https://www.natlawreview.com/article/unbranded-web-sites-fda-finds-violative-promotional-practices|access-date=May 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n\n* [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory]]\n* ''[[Big Pharma (book)|Big Pharma: How the World's Biggest Drug Companies Control Illness]]'' (2006) by Jacky Law\n* ''[[Side Effects (Bass book)|Side Effects]]'' (2008) by [[Alison Bass]]\n* ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' (2012) by [[Ben Goldacre]]\n* [[Disease mongering]]\n* [[Ethics in pharmaceutical sales]]\n* [[Inverse benefit law]]\n* [[National pharmaceuticals policy]]\n* [[Pharmaceutical lobby]]\n* [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]]\n* [[Prescription drug prices in the United States]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{refbegin}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Insider's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales'', Seventh Edition ({{ISBN|0-9704153-6-2}})\n* Merrill Goozner, ''The $800 million pill''.

Physicians with access to free samples are more likely to prescribe brand name medication over equivalent generic medications.<ref name=Women08/>  Other studies found that free samples decreased the likelihood that physicians would follow standard of care practices.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nReceiving pharmaceutical samples does not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander GC, Zhang J, Basu A | year = 2008 | title = Characteristics of patients receiving pharmaceutical samples and association between sample receipt and out-of-pocket prescription costs | url = | journal = Medical Care | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 394\u2013402 | pmid = 18362819 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181618ee0}}</ref>\n\nIt is argued that a benefit to free samples is the \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d approach. Free samples give immediate access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away.  Also, it saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, free samples allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having to spend money on a filled prescription at a [[pharmacy]].<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n===Continuing medical education===\nHours spent by physicians in industry-supported [[continuing medical education]] (CME) is greater than that from either [[medical school]]s or professional societies.<ref name=Women08/>\n\n===Pharmaceutical representatives===\nCurrently, there are approximately 81,000 [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zsassociates.com/news_events/news_media/the_doctor_wont_see_you_mr_pharma_rep_now/ |title=ZS Associates; Pharmaceutical |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> pursuing some 830,000 pharmaceutical prescribers. A pharmaceutical representative will often try to see a given physician every few weeks. Representatives often have a call list of about 200-300 physicians with 120-180 targets that should be visited in 1-2 or 3 week cycle.\n\nBecause of the large size of the pharmaceutical sales force, the organization, management, and measurement of effectiveness of the sales force are significant business challenges. Management tasks are usually broken down into the areas of physician targeting, sales force size and structure, sales force optimization, call planning, and sales forces effectiveness. A few pharmaceutical companies have realized that training sales representatives on high science alone is not enough, especially when most products are similar in quality.  Thus, training sales representatives on relationship selling techniques in addition to medical science and product knowledge, can make a difference in sales force effectiveness.  Specialist physicians are relying more and more on specialty sales reps for product information, because they are more knowledgeable than primary care reps.\n\nThe United States has 81,000 pharmaceutical representatives or 1 for every 7.9 physicians.<ref name=Women08/> The number and persistence of pharmaceutical  representatives has placed a burden on the time of physicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=177968  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> \"As the  number of reps went up, the amount of time an average rep spent with  doctors went down\u2014so  far down, that tactical scaling has spawned a strategic crisis.  Physicians no longer spend much time with sales reps, nor do they see this as a serious problem.\"\n\nMarketers must  decide on the appropriate size of a sales force needed to sell a  particular portfolio of drugs to the target market. Factors influencing this decision are the optimal reach (how many physicians to see) and frequency (how often to see  them) for each individual physician, how many patients suffer from that disease state, how many sales representatives to devote to office and group practice and how many to devote to hospital accounts if needed. To aid this decision, customers are broken down into different classes according to their prescription behavior, patient population, and of course, their business potential.\n\nMarketers attempt to identify the set of physicians most likely to prescribe a given drug. Historically, this was done by measuring the number of total prescriptions (TRx) and new prescriptions (NRx) per week that each physician writes. This information is collected by commercial vendors. The physicians are then \"deciled\" into ten groups based on their writing patterns. Higher deciles are more aggressively targeted. Some pharmaceutical companies use additional information such as:\n* Profitability of a prescription (script),\n* Accessibility of the physician,\n* Tendency of the physician to use the pharmaceutical company's drugs,\n* Effect of managed care formularies on the ability of the physician to prescribe a drug,\n* The [[adoption sequence]] of the physician (that is, how readily the physician adopts new drugs in place of older treatments), and\n* The tendency of the physician to use a wide palette of drugs\n* Influence that physicians have on their colleagues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kiefer|authorlink1=Kiefer Lee|last2=Carter|first2=Steve|date=2012|title=Global Marketing Management|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=524|isbn=978-0-19-960970-3}}</ref>\n\nPhysicians are perhaps the most important component in  sales. They  write the prescriptions that determine which drugs will be used by  people.  Influencing the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales.  Historically, this was done by a large pharmaceutical sales force. A  medium-sized  pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of 1000  representatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  The largest companies have tens of thousands of representatives around  the world. Sales representatives called upon physicians regularly,  providing clinical information, approved journal articles, and free drug samples. This is still the approach  today; however, economic pressures on the industry are causing  pharmaceutical companies to rethink the traditional sales process to  physicians. The industry has seen a large scale adoption of Pharma CRM systems that works on laptops and more recently [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The new age pharmaceutical representative is armed with key data at his fingertips and tools to maximize the time spent with physicians.\n\n===Peer influence===\n;Key opinion leaders\nKey opinion leaders (KOL), or \"thought leaders\", are  respected individuals, such as prominent medical school faculty, who  influence physicians through their professional status. Pharmaceutical  companies generally engage key opinion leaders early in the drug  development process to provide advocacy and key marketing feedback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharma-mkting.com/glossary/keyopinionleader.htm  |title=Glossary Term: Key Opinion Leader |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some  pharmaceutical companies identify key opinion leaders through direct  inquiry of physicians (primary research).  Recently, pharmaceutical companies have begun to use [[social network analysis]] to uncover thought leaders; because it does not introduce respondent bias, which is commonly found in primary research; it can identify and map out the entire scientific community for a disease state; and it has greater compliance with state and federal regulations; because physician prescribing patterns are not used to create the social network.<ref>http://www.lnxpharma.com/images/pages/Lnx_Whitepaper_1.pdf</ref>\n\nAlternatives  to  segmenting physicians purely on the basis of prescribing do exist,  and  marketers can call upon strategic partners who specialize in   delineating which characteristics of true opinion leadership, a   physician does or does not possess.  Such analyses can help guide   marketers in how to optimize KOL engagements as bona fide advisors to a   brand, and can help shape clinical development and clinical data   publication plans for instance, ultimately advancing patient care.\n\n;Colleagues\nPhysicians  acquire information through informal contacts with their colleagues,  including social events, professional affiliations, common hospital  affiliations, and common medical school affiliations. Some  pharmaceutical companies identify influential colleagues through  commercially available prescription writing and patient level data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=395598  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\nDoctor  dinner meetings are an effective way for physicians to acquire  educational information from respected peers.  These meetings are  sponsored by some pharmaceutical companies.\n\n===Journal articles and technical documentation===\n\nRecent legal cases and US congressional  hearings have provided access to [[Drug Industry Document Archive|pharmaceutical industry documents]]  revealing new marketing strategies for drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/4/284  |title=Narrative Review: The Promotion of Gabapentin: An Analysis of Internal Industry Documents -- Steinman et al. 145 (4): 284 -- Annals of Internal Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Activities  once considered independent of promotional intent, including [[continuing medical education]] and [[medical research]],  are used, including paying to publish articles about promoted drugs for  the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study  results.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/145/4/305?etoc  |title=Safeguarding Patient Welfare: Who's In Charge? -- Henney 145 (4): 305 -- Annals of Internal Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Private and public insurers===\nPublic and private insurers affect the writing of prescriptions by physicians through [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formularies]] that restrict the number and types of drugs that the insurer will cover. Not only can the insurer affect drug sales by including or excluding a particular drug from a formulary, they can affect sales by tiering, or placing bureaucratic hurdles to prescribing certain drugs. In January 2006, the United States instituted a new public prescription drug plan through its [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program. Known as [[Medicare Part&nbsp;D]], this program engages private insurers to negotiate with [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] for the placement of drugs on tiered formularies.\n\n==To consumers==\nOnly two countries as of 2008 allow [[direct to consumer advertising]] (DTCA): the United States and New Zealand.<ref name=\"NYT-20151127\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Women08/> Since the late 1970s, DTCA of prescription drugs has become important in the United States. It takes two main forms: the promotion or creation of a disease out of a non-pathologic physical condition or the promotion of a medication.<ref name=Women08/> The rhetorical objective of direct-to-consumer advertising is to directly influence the patient-physician dialogue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|last2=Balzhiser|first2=Deborah|date=September 2015|title=Pharmaceutical Companies Are Writing the Script for Health Consumerism|journal=Commun.

In some areas it is required that ads for drugs include a list of possible side effects, so that users are informed of both facets of a medicine. [[Canada]]'s limitations on pharmaceutical advertising ensure that commercials that mention the name of a product cannot in any way describe what it does. Commercials that mention a medical problem cannot also mention the name of the product for sale; at most, they can direct the viewer to a website or telephone number operated by the pharmaceutical company.\n\nReynold Spector has provided examples of how positive and negative hype can affect perceptions of pharmaceuticals using examples of certain cancer drugs, such as [[Avastin]] and [[Opdivo]], in the former case and [[statin]]s in the latter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spector |first1=Reynold |title=Drug Therapy Hype: The Misuse of Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=44\u201349}}</ref>\n\n===Drug coupons===\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies often provide [[drug coupon]]s to consumers to help offset the [[copayment]]s charged by health insurers for prescription medication. These coupons are generally used to promote medications that compete with non-preferred products and cheaper, generic alternatives by reducing or eliminating the extra out-of-pocket costs that an insurers typically charge a patient for a non-preferred drug product.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lunzer Kritz|first=Francesca|title=Check out drug coupons, then check bottom line|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/health/he-coupons3|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=3 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Economics==\nPharmaceutical company spending on marketing exceeds that spent on research.<ref name=\"Brezis2008\" /><ref name=Women08/>  In 2004 in Canada $1.7 billion a year was spent marketing drugs to physicians and in the United States $21 billion were spent in 2002.<ref name=McGill04>{{cite web  |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/orig_articles/barfett.pdf  |title=www.medicine.mcgill.ca |format= |website=  |accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2005 money spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States was estimated at $29.9 billion with one estimate as high as $57 billion.<ref name=Women08>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sufrin CB, Ross JS |title=Pharmaceutical industry marketing: understanding its impact on women's health |journal=Obstet Gynecol Surv |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=585\u201396 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18713478 |doi=10.1097/OGX.0b013e31817f1585 |url=}}</ref>  When the US number are broken down 56% was free samples, 25% was detailing of physicians, 12.5% was direct to users advertising, 4% on hospital detailing, and 2% on journal ads.<ref name=McGill04/> In the United States approximately $20 billion could be saved if generics were used instead of equivalent brand name products.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nAlthough pharmaceutical companies have made large investments in marketing their products, overall promotional spending has been decreasing over the last few years, and declined by 10 percent from 2009 to 2010.

[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations require all prescription drug promotion to be truthful and not misleading, based on \"substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience\", to provide a \"fair balance\" between the risks and benefits of the promoted drug, and to maintain consistency with labeling approved by the FDA. The FDA Office of Prescription Drug Promotion enforces these requirements.\n\nIn the 1990s, antipsychotics were \"still seen as treatments for the most serious mental illnesses, like hallucinatory schizophrenia, and recast them for much broader uses\". Drugs such as [[Abilify]] and [[Geodon]] were given to a broad range of patients, from preschoolers to octogenarians. In 2010, more than a half-million youths took antipsychotic drugs, and one-quarter of nursing-home residents have used them. Yet the government warns that the drugs may be fatal to some older patients and have unknown effects on children.<ref name=bied2010/>\n\nEvery major company selling the drugs\u2014[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Johnson & Johnson]]\u2014has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements in 2009 set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly\u2019s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.<ref name=bied2010>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=2 October 2010  |work=[[New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement.

Both physicians  and users are increasing their reliance on the Internet as a source of health and medical information, prompting pharmaceutical marketers to look at digital channels for opportunities to reach their target  audiences.\n\nIn 2008, 84% of U.S. physicians used the  Internet and other technologies to access pharmaceutical, biotech or  medical device information\u2014a 20% increase from 2004. At the same time, sales reps are  finding it more difficult to get time with doctors for in-person details.  Pharmaceutical companies are exploring online marketing as an alternative way to reach physicians. Emerging e-promotional activities include live video detailing, online events, electronic sampling, and physician customer service portals such as PV Updates, MDLinx, Aptus Health (former Physicians Interactive), and [[Epocrates]].\n\nDirect-to-users  marketers are also recognizing the need to shift to digital channels as audiences become more fragmented and the number of access points for news, entertainment and information multiplies. Standard television,  radio and print direct-to-users (DTC) advertisements are less relevant than in the past, and companies  are beginning to focus more on digital marketing efforts like product websites, [[display advertising|online display advertising]], [[search engine marketing]], [[social media]] campaigns, place-based media and [[mobile advertising]] to reach the over 145 million U.S. adults online for health information.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications issued a warning letter concerning two unbranded consumer targeted Web sites sponsored by [[Novartis]] Pharmaceuticals Corporation as the websites promoted a drug for an unapproved use, the websites failed to disclose the risks associated with the use of the drug and made unsubstantiated dosing claims.<ref>{{citation |author=Debra Dunne |title=Unbranded Web Sites: FDA Finds Violative Promotional Practices |date=October 4, 2010 |publisher=Stradley Ronon  |url= https://www.natlawreview.com/article/unbranded-web-sites-fda-finds-violative-promotional-practices|access-date=May 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n\n* [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory]]\n* ''[[Big Pharma (book)|Big Pharma: How the World's Biggest Drug Companies Control Illness]]'' (2006) by Jacky Law\n* ''[[Side Effects (Bass book)|Side Effects]]'' (2008) by [[Alison Bass]]\n* ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' (2012) by [[Ben Goldacre]]\n* [[Disease mongering]]\n* [[Ethics in pharmaceutical sales]]\n* [[Inverse benefit law]]\n* [[National pharmaceuticals policy]]\n* [[Pharmaceutical lobby]]\n* [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]]\n* [[Prescription drug prices in the United States]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{refbegin}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Insider's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales'', Seventh Edition ({{ISBN|0-9704153-6-2}})\n* Merrill Goozner, ''The $800 million pill''.
