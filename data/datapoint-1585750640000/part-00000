He rode it three times, coming 11th in 1903 and fourth in 1904. In 1905 he was part of [[Henri Pepin|Henri Pepin's]] experimental team that 'voyaged' rather than 'raced' its way around France.\n\n==Background==\nJean Dargassies was a blacksmith in the village of Grisolles, north of [[Toulouse]]. The town's main industry was broom-making. The forge was at 4 av\u00e9nue de la R\u00e9publique.<ref>Journal du Dimanche, France, 27 July 2003</ref> He was \"not very tall but well built, with thighs and calves like the pillars of a cathedral.\"<ref>L'Auto, France, 13 July 1903</ref> He had a spreading blond moustache.<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\">Journal du Dimanche, France, 13 July 2003, p19</ref> In a picture of the forge, he is posing beside a horse, a broad leather belt round his waist, a hammer in his hand. His mother wears an ankle-length striped dress and a bonnet. Two other men in the family, probably his brothers, are also there. All four are wearing wooden [[clogs]].<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\"/>\n\nDargassies' father was also a blacksmith, his mother a housewife [''m\u00e9nag\u00e8re'']. Jean was the second son. The oldest brother, J\u00e9rome, was destined to take over the business.<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\"/>\n\n==Entering the Tour de France==\nLegend says that Dargassies bought a bicycle so that he could ride 25&nbsp;km to [[Montauban]], as far to the north as Toulouse was to the south. Nobody in the family had left the immediate area.<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\"/>  The shop owner had heard of a new race, the Tour de France, to be promoted that summer. He looked him up and down and said: \"You could ride that, with muscles like yours.\"<ref name=\"Chany 88\">Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France</ref> Dargassies wrote to ''[[L'Auto]]'' to say he wanted to take part. By the days before the start, he had heard nothing. He went to [[Paris]] anyway to meet the race director, [[G\u00e9o Lef\u00e8vre]].\nThere were few entrants from the south and Lef\u00e8vre, a Parisian, was entranced by Dargassie's country ways and his marked southern accent. He recounted the meeting in ''L'Auto'':\n:\"My name is Dargassies and I've come from Grisolles.\"\n:\"Where?\"\n:\"From Grisolles, near Montauban, and I've come to make inquiries.\"\n:\"About?\"\n:\"Inquiries about the Tour de France.\"\n:\"But... You're already entered, I think.\n:\"Heavens, yes, [''pardi''], I've entered! I just wanted to know what's going to happen.\"\n:\"You haven't read ''L'Auto''?\"\n:''L'Auto''? I don't think anyone reads that in ''Monnetaubanne.'''\" (Lef\u00e8vre took pleasure in reproducing Dargassie's pronounce-every-letter southern accent.)\n:\"Where?\"\n:\"''Monnetaubanne'', [[Tarn-et-Garonne]].\"\n:\"Oh, Montauban!\"\n:\"Yes. The man who sold me my bike told me there was a Tour de France race and he said: 'Dargaties, you're made for that.'\"<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\"/><ref>Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France, p22</ref><ref name=\"ProCyc 08\">Procycling, UK, 2008</ref>\n\nDargaties was the blacksmith's real name. Lef\u00e8vre misheard it.  Jean Dargaties became known as Jean Dargassies.<ref name=\"ProCyc 08\"/>\nLef\u00e8vre asked: \"Tell me, have you ever actually ridden a cycle race?\" Dargassies replied: \"No, but I've ridden from Grisolles to Montauban and back and I didn't even have to try. I'm a blacksmith; I'm not worried about tiredness.\"\n\n==Riding the Tour de France==\nThe first Tour de France started at [[Montgeron]], south of Paris. By Toulouse he was one of 30 left in the race. With them he left the city in the night and led the race as it passed through his village.<ref>It was the first time a rider had been allowed to lead through his home town. The tradition continued during quiet periods of the race until the end of the 1970s.</ref> Lef\u00e8vre reported: \"The whole of Grisolles is by the side of the road. They're here to see Dargassies, the champion of the region. When he rode by, every voice shouted in encouragement, in a long avenue of people all the way to Montauban.\"<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\"/>\n\nDargassies was three minutes behind the leaders as he came through Montauban and his front fork had broken. As a blacksmith, he had no trouble finding a colleague to make a repair. In Paris he finished 11th, 13 hours behind the winner, [[Maurice Garin]]. His prize: 145 francs. When he got home to Grisolles he sent a telegram to Lef\u00e8vre: \"Got back home today. All my compatriots are crazy, crazier than me. Everybody at the station, music, flowers, speech. Fame! Fame!\"<ref name=\"Journal Dim p19\"/> He rode the Tour again in 1904 and finished fourth, lifted from 10th by disqualifications of the best riders for cheating. This time he won 1,000 francs.\n\n==The first ''domestique''==\n{{main article|Henri P\u00e9pin}}\n\nDargassies rode the Tour in 1905. There he met another rider, [[Henri P\u00e9pin]], a prosperous landowner from [[Gontaud-de-Nogaret]], east of [[Bordeaux]].<ref>P\u00e9pin is often mistakenly called a baron. The main article explains the misunderstanding.</ref> The two made a deal that Dargassies and another rider, Henri Gauban, would pace P\u00e9pin round the 1907 event. Instead of racing, they would take their time, stop at good restaurants, spend the night in the best hotels they could find.<ref name=\"Chany 88\"/> In return, P\u00e9pin would pay his helpers what they would have received had they won the race.\n\nAs hired hands sacrificing their own hopes for their leader's, Dargassies and Gauban became cycling's first [[Cycling domestique|domestiques]], although the word wasn't coined until later.\n\nThe three riders never separated. They took 12 hours and 20 minutes longer than [[\u00c9mile Georget]] on the stage from [[Roubaix]] to [[Metz]] and the judges were powerless because the race was decided not on time but points. It mattered not what speed riders managed than the order in which they crossed the line. The judges had to wait for everyone.<ref name=\"ProCyc 08\"/>\nP\u00e9pin pulled out between [[Lyon]] and [[Grenoble]] on stage five, paid the money he had promised and set off for the train home. Dargassies joined him. Gauban pulled out on the 11th.\nIt was Dargassies' last Tour.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nDargassies retired and ran first a food shop and then a bike shop, at the junction of the rue Faug\u00e8re and the rue de Lumel in Grisolles.<ref>Le Journal du Dimanche, France, 20 July 2003</ref> He died 1965, when he was 93. He is buried in the town's cemetery under his original name, Dargaties.
