He tells Tamwar that there are plans to merge the street markets and not to tell anyone. However, Tamwar's sister [[Shabnam Masood|Shabnam]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]), leaks the news causing the market traders to rally together, led by [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]). He and [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) rent a flat together. Aleks dates [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), on orders from her sister, [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]). When Ronnie calls their relationship off, Aleks is annoyed. When Ronnie fails to meet Roxy as planned, she calls Aleks and he comes to her rescue. The pair end up having sex, which infuriates Ronnie.\n\nStruggling to pay the rent, Aleks advertises for a third person to live with him and Jake. [[#Tosh Mackintosh|Fiona \"Tosh\" Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs) later moves in and shocks him when he learns that she is in a relationship with [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]). Later, Roxy discovers that Ronnie paid Aleks and they have an argument but they stay together. Then, Aleks' young daughter, [[#Ineta Shirovs|Ineta]] (Octavia Alexandru) talks to him over video chat, asking if he is coming home. [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) becomes suspicious when he finds Aleks talking to somebody over the Internet in Latvian and he angrily throws Alfie out. Alfie enlists Tamwar's help to hack into Aleks' laptop and see what he is hiding, and Tamwar tells Alfie that he has been contacting his wife. Alfie and Tamwar tell Roxy but she does not believe him, choosing instead to ask Tamwar about Alfie's discovery and he shows her the evidence. Later on, Roxy cooks Aleks a romantic meal and asks about his wife. He reveals he has a daughter, Ineta, and that he is married to Ineta's mother but they are separated. Roxy then throws Aleks out and buys him a plane tickets to Latvia but as he is about to leave, Roxy stops him, saying that she still wants to be with him. Aleks later nearly comes to blows with Alfie after he makes remarks about Aleks' marital status and later gives Alfie's pitch to rival market trader [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]), despite Alfie excusing his absence on the day to illness, causing further tension between them. Roxy asks Aleks to show his commitment to her and he arranges a surprise holiday, proving to Roxy that he's committed and avoiding his wife [[#Marta Shirovs|Marta]] ([[Noeleen Comiskey]]) and their daughter who have arrived from Latvia. Aleks has sex with Marta in his office. Ronnie's partner, [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]), sees him and demands he tells Roxy, but Marta does before he can. She is devastated and throws him out; however, she realises her feelings for him are too strong and invites him to move back in. Marta goes home but leaves Ineta with Aleks, believing she will be better off in England. Aleks supports Charlie after the traumatic birth of his son [[Matthew Mitchell-Cotton|Matthew]] following a car crash and, inspired by Dot, suggests the name Matthew. Charlie's wife, Ronnie, goes into a coma after Matthew's birth. Aleks learns that Roxy and Charlie have slept together so he goes to the hospital to tell Ronnie but cannot bring himself to do so.\n\nTamwar begins to suspects Aleks after he takes an \"advance\" from the market office cash box, Tamwar later studies Aleks' records and works out that Aleks has been taking an extra maintenance fee but there is no record of it on the council receipts and he has been ripping off the traders. Tamwar confronts Aleks about it so he fires Tamwar and throws the evidence in the bin. Later, Tamwar visits Aleks and tells him that he is fired as Tamwar told the authorities about Aleks fiddling the books and the police have been called. Ineta rushes downstairs to answer the door to Marta as she had overheard their conversation about moving away and so called her mum. Roxy is torn between Aleks begging her to go with him and Marta suggesting that she would be breaking up a family and only to leave with Aleks if she loves him. Roxy decides that she cannot lie to herself any more and agrees that Marta is right. Aleks makes it clear that they will not see each other again so Roxy returns her engagement ring and kisses him goodbye and Aleks leaves before the police can catch him with Marta and Ineta leaving Walford.<ref name=\"EastEnders leaving\">{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a642340/eastenders-kristian-kiehling-leaves-aleks-shirovs-role.html#~pa30H1cTVlj1PA | title=EastEnders: Kristian Kiehling leaves Aleks Shirovs role | work=[[Digital Spy]] | date=16 April 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2015 | author=Kilkelly, Daniel}}</ref>\n\nKristian Kiehling was nominated for Best Bad Boy at the [[Inside Soap Awards]] in 2014 for his portrayal as Aleks.<ref name=ISA14longlist>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a587117/inside-soap-awards-2014-longlist-revealed.html#~pmHnb63L2GIYAp Inside Soap Awards 2014 longlist revealed \u2013 Soaps News \u2013 Digital Spy]</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Stan Carter==\n{{Main|Stan Carter}}\n'''Stan Carter''', played by [[Timothy West]], is the father of [[Shirley Carter|Shirley]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Tina Carter|Tina]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), and the grandfather of [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), although Mick believes Stan to be his father.<ref name=\"Dainty\"/> He made his first screen appearance on 27 January 2014.

She brings Tosh to a family dinner, where she instantly clashes with Shirley, who knows that Tosh can be violent and previously beat Tina when they were together, while befriending Tina's sister-in-law [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]). Shirley visits Tosh at the fire station to warn her to stay away from Tina, but is humiliated by the firefighter who soaks her using a fire hose. Still determined to stop Tina from seeing Tosh, Shirley locks her in the upstairs lounge of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, but Tosh rescues Tina with a fire ladder. As they prepare to spend some time together as a couple, Tina is called to help [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) who has drunk herself paralytic despite being pregnant. Tosh, unwilling to give up her time off, leaves Tina to deal with the situation alone.\n\nTosh later feels insecure about Tina's friendship with [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) despite the fact that she is not a lesbian.

Desperate for cash to fund IVF treatment, Tina starts dealing her aunt [[Babe Smith]]'s ([[Annette Badland]]) drugs. Tosh discovers this and struggles to trust Tina again, but eventually forgives her. They choose a sperm donor, and Tosh is inseminated though she worries that their child will not know its father.\n\nShe becomes pregnant, news which they share with Tina's supportive family. When [[Alfie Moon]]'s ([[Shane Richie]]) house is burnt to the ground, Tosh actively stops people from entering the fire. She later reveals to Tina she has miscarried, but plans to try for another baby. She becomes suspicious that Alfie started the fire himself as insurance fraud, and shares her belief with the fire investigation officer before going to the police, despite Tina's brother [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) actively trying to stop her, aware that her suspicions are correct but knowing Alfie's actions were out of desperation. After, when a drunk Dean approaches Tosh and offers to be donor for her and Tina's baby, they agree on the condition of not telling Tina, however the next day at Sharon and Phil's wedding Tosh confesses to Tina about Dean and she is furious. Tina later forgives her, when Tosh discovers she is not pregnant, she punches Tina after accusing her of not being supportive. Tosh becomes paranoid that Tina is having an affair with Sonia when she helps her through body image issues, and she finds Sonia's watch in the flat. She confronts Tina and viciously beats her. Afterwards, she tries to apologise but Tina rejects her, telling her to take a job and a new flat in Croydon.

Three months later, his father Mick visits [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]), Mick's grandfather but before he can reach the flat he is punched by an unknown youth, and afterwards Mick discloses to [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) that he believes that the man was his son, Lee. A week later, it is Lee who saves Stan from a small fire at [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. The family meet at the hospital. When Mick asks him why he punched him, he confirms that he was in Stan's flat. Lee then has sex with [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), however she insists it was a one-night stand. He begins pursuing [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) instead, but later resumes his affair with Lucy. When Lucy is found dead after being murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), the police take a [[DNA profiling|DNA sample]] from Lee, before he returns to the army.\n\nHe returns as a surprise for Linda on her birthday. He bonds with his uncle, [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]), and becomes drunk at his mother's party. After passing out on Mick's bed, he tells his father he did something stupid in connection with Lucy.<ref name=\"10jul14\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 10/07/2014 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0499j1h |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Richard Lynn; Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Writer: [[Daran Little]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The next day, Lee reveals that he saw Lucy arguing with [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]). Lee, along with his great aunt [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) and her girlfriend [[#Tosh Mackintosh|Tosh Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), confront Billy, but he angrily tells them to leave. In [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) memorial to the commemorate the centenary of [[World War I]], Lee raises and lowers the Union Flag as a memorial. He tries to win back Whitney, but she is still upset about how he abandoned her for Lucy. Eventually, she forgives him, and they begin a relationship. Whitney's adoptive mother [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) protests to the relationship until Lee wins her round. Lee and Whitney have sex, and she confides in him that her estranged brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) is trying to get back in contact with her.\n\nLee is later unhappy when [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) returns to Walford after serving time in prison for killing his father [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) ex-girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]]'s ([[Linda Henry]]) best friend, [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Ferguson]]). Lee's brother [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) shows an interest in him, knowing that he is [[homosexual|gay]], but Ben tells him he is no longer homosexual and insults Johnny with homophobic names, resulting in Lee viciously attacking him. Lee realises that [[Lauren Branning]]'s ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) alibi is suspicious when he views her outside Lucy's house on a video taken on the night of Lucy's death. He also later shares this information with the police investigating Lucy's murder. Lee and [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) later learn that Mick and Linda are not actually married as they had previously thought.\n\nDuring Christmas and the New Year after Johnny's departure to go travelling, Lee and Nancy become paranoid about the situation between their parents and Dean, who believe that Dean has done something wrong. Lee and Nancy are left in charge of The Queen Vic for several weeks while Mick and Linda go on holiday. Nancy is determined to know what Dean has done, but Shirley and Tina refuse to talk to Nancy without Mick and Linda's consent. When Shirley moves Dean in, Nancy is upset by this and Lee tries to talk Nancy into accepting Dean's presence while Mick and Linda are away. After throwing a party, Mick and Linda later return and are horrified to see Shirley behind the bar and Dean drinking in The Queen Vic. After reporting Dean to the police, Linda finally reveals to Lee and Nancy that Dean raped her and it is possible that he could be the father of Linda's unborn baby. Lee is angry to learn of this news and is determined to make Dean pay. Both Lee and Mick's tempers worsen when Dean continues to harass them and their family. Lee and Dean fight in the street when Dean denies attacking Linda and Mick makes it clear to Dean and Shirley to stay away from The Queen Vic, although Shirley decides to instead stand by him when Dean disappears for a few weeks. Lee is later happy when Linda proposes to Mick, who accepts.\n\nLee and his family are upset to learn that Stan has died after he was diagnosed with [[terminal illness|terminal]] [[prostate cancer]]. The feud between Dean, Shirley and Mick continues, which begins to cause disruption for the other members of the Carter family. Dean is arrested on suspicion of breaking his bail conditions, but he is later released from prison. Linda gives birth to a baby boy, later named [[Ollie Carter|Ollie]] (Jack Tilley), after falling down the stairs and Lee is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that the baby may only be his half-brother. Mick talks Lee round to accepting the fact that the baby may be Dean's but he will always be the baby's brother, half or not. Lee is later relieved when he learns that Ollie is not Dean's, and visits Linda and Ollie in hospital, with the company of Nancy and Whitney.\n\nLee begins to develop [[clinical depression]], which leads to him missing work and being discharged from the Army when he punches one of his colleagues who flirts with Whitney. Lee is prescribed medication for his condition but he refuses take it. He gets a job at the local car lot, but Lee develops bitter feelings towards those around him, repeatedly shunning Whitney and his family. His worsening alcoholism nearly gets him sacked from the car lot, but Whitney convinces [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) to give Lee one more chance. Lee's mood improves when he makes a sale at the car lot and is invited to a Halloween party. However, a heavily pregnant [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) is electrocuted by a broken socket that Lee did not fix properly. Stacey's boyfriend [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) punches Lee and threatens to kill him if Stacey's baby dies. Lee breaks down in Whitney's arms when he realises the baby could be dead because of him and confesses to being drunk when fixing the socket, but is relieved when Whitney tells him that the baby and Stacey are not badly injured. He and Whitney are later invited to have lunch with Martin, Stacey, [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]) in The Queen Vic, where Martin apologises to Lee for punching him and forgives him for the incident. Days later, during Dean and [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) engagement party, Lee gets drunk and confronts Shirley after finding out that she and Mick have been seeing each other secretly. During the argument, Lee tries to attack his grandfather [[#Buster Briggs|Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), who escorts him out and takes him to the caf\u00e9. Buster tells Lee that he needs to start taking his anti-depressants and stay focused on his career. He then returns him home and Lee tells Mick that he has no problem with him and Shirley seeing each other. Lee later knocks himself unconscious while trying to eject Dean from the pub, so is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. When he regains consciousness, he overhears Whitney confess to Mick via the baby monitor that she intends to break up with him after Mick and Linda's upcoming wedding, unable to handle his depression. On New Year's Day 2016, the day of the wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee then tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Dean turns up to the wedding after attempting to rape Roxy and pushes Shirley into a nearby lake, and Mick saves them both. The police subsequently arrive and arrest Dean for the attempted rape of Roxy. Later, when Phil turns up at The Queen Vic drunk and demands more drinks, Lee tries to escort him out but Phil, being the owner of the car lot, sacks him. Lee later works alongside Buster at his local fish stall, but sneaks off one afternoon for an interview with local landlady [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Thelma Bragg|Thelma Bragg]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]), whom was initially interested in hiring Nancy. Lee gets the job, but when Nancy, who was covering his shift for Buster, finds out, she calls him a spineless traitor before assuring him that he will not last long given his history of failure. Although Whitney praises Lee for getting the job, he walks away in misery.\n\nTo assist with getting to work, Mick buys Lee a new car, which he takes Whitney for a drive in. During their drive, Whitney confesses to kissing Mick. An enraged Lee finds Mick and Linda at [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) restaurant and tries to attack them both. He later gets drunk and is thrown out of The Albert by [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) for insulting his wife, [[Kim Fox|Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]). He then bumps into an equally drunk [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) and they end up having unprotected sex. Whitney goes to stay with [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), where the next day, Nancy drops the rest of Whitney's belongings off as Lee is unable to face her after what happened with Mick. However, he later sees Abi talking to Whitney, and fears she may have told them about their one-night stand. Abi denies doing so, but tells Lee that Whitney is planning to leave Walford. Lee rushes to Sonia's house and begs Whitney to stay, finally confessing that he has not been taking his anti-depressants. When his family finds out, Mick furiously denounces him for lying, but Lee promises to ensure he gets better from now on. Later, when Whitney comes down to The Queen Vic after talking to Nancy, Lee asks her to marry him, and she accepts. Lee's relationship with Nancy is further tarnished when he reveals he told Thelma about Nancy's epilepsy, which further jeopardised her chances of getting the job. She then leaves The Queen Vic to move in with [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) and works on her market stall. Lee eventually quits his new job following what he believes to be sexual harassment from Thelma, and decides to work at The Queen Vic, taking Nancy's old bartending job. Nancy joins everyone for a Mother's Day meal, but when she finds out Lee took her old job, they have another argument. Lee tells her that he is not surprised her boyfriend [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) left her, prompting Nancy to angrily push Lee. He falls into Ollie's highchair, sending him and Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) crashing to the floor as Nancy and Whitney watch in shock. Mick and Linda rush back to find that Ollie has no apparent injuries, but Nancy and Lee continue to argue despite Mick and Linda's protests. Eventually, Mick loses his temper, smashing a chair and throwing Lee and Nancy out of The Queen Vic. When Linda later finds Ollie not breathing in his cot and later suffers a seizure, the Carters are told that Ollie may have brain damage, after hitting his head severely during Lee and Nancy's fight. Mick blames Nancy for the accident, and after months of feuding, he forgives her, however Nancy and Tamwar leave Walford to go travelling.\n\nWhen Whitney discovers she is pregnant, Lee worries that he would not be a good father due to his depression. They visit the doctors, but both Lee and Whitney are tested positive for [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], which Lee caught from Abi. Lee lets Whitney wrongly believe that she had caught the STI during her past relationship with [[Rob Grayson]] ([[Jody Latham]]), who [[Sexual exploitation|sexually exploited]] her.

Lee tells her how much he wants to look after her and she tells him that she is sure that he will. Lee gets a job, telling everyone he is a sales executive in the city. However, he worries about how he will cope. After his first day at work, Lee uses a credit card to buy Whitney an expensive pair of earrings. Johnny (now [[Ted Reilly]]) worries about the amount of money that Lee is spending on his wedding, but Lee insists he is fine. Lee checks his bank account and sees he is \u00a3250 overdrawn, and then applies for a \u00a32000 payday loan. Lee realises he should be honest with Whitney about the money but he backs out of telling her. When Abi realises Lee is not over Whitney's miscarriage, she tells him she should have told him about the chlamydia as she read that it could have caused the miscarriage, leaving him worried. Lee confronts Whitney over her miscarriage lie, and she admits that she worried how he would cope but now wants complete honesty, to which he agrees. However, he ignores reminders about repaying the loan. Johnny discovers Lee's debts and tells him to be honest with Whitney before they marry the following day. He attempts to tell her but she thinks he is stressed over not spending time together and tells him not to worry.<ref name=\"3nov16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 03/11/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b081vmx1 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Writer: Peter Mattessi |network=[[BBC]] |station= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 3 November 2016}}</ref> Lee calls in sick to work so that he and Whitney can marry.

Trapped in a depressed state, Lee cries at home but keeps the truth from his family. When Whitney surprises Lee at work, she assumes Lee's colleague [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Osman \"Oz\" Bolat|Oz Bolat]] (Noah Maxwell-Clarke) is his employee. Whitney hopes to move to an expensive flat in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] and asks Lee to put a deposit on the flat but knowing he cannot afford it, he does not do so and tells her he was too late. However, [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) offers one of his flats on Albert Square at a reduced rate so Whitney is happy but Lee still knows he cannot afford it. He asks his boss for an advance on his wages but is refused due to his poor performance. Lee then steals a sentimental piece of jewellery from Linda, attempting to pawn it, but he is not offered what he expected. He tells Shirley he cannot afford a flat, so she tells him that Whitney will be happy as long as she has him. He cheers up following Shirley's comment, but when Whitney buys a picture reading \"home sweet home\" for the flat, he steals charity money from the pub and tells Jack he has a deposit. Whitney and Lee move in but he makes excuses not to have sex with her and she worries when his mood swings return. When Whitney seduces Lee, he suffers [[erectile dysfunction]] due to his depression, though Whitney comforts him. Whitney then suspects Lee is having an affair, and when she tries to surprise him by visiting him at work, she finds out he has called in sick. He spends the day hiding in the allotments, briefly encountering [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), who tells him that relationships built on lies never last. Whitney confronts Lee, accusing him of having an affair, but he says he was buying her a Christmas present. Whitney believes him and they finally have sex. At work, Lee is continuously harassed and bullied by his aggressive colleague Oz, who tells him he knows he was not sick the previous day and can prove it.

After she tells Mick this, Mick forces Lee to give him Oz's address and returns with blood on his knuckles, sparking concern from Babe.<ref name=\"3jan17\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 03/01/2017 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0881hvr |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: John Howlett; Writer: Colin Wyatt |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 3 January 2017}}</ref> When Lee next sees Oz, he has a black eye and tells Lee they should keep away from each other from now on.<ref name=\"5jan17\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 05/01/2017 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0881k8v |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: John Howlett; Writer: Alex Straker, Robert Butler |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nLee and Whitney begin to argue over money and he blames Whitney for his financial difficulties. This causes much tension for the couple and he becomes increasingly jealous when [[Danny Mitchell (EastEnders)|Danny Mitchell]] ([[Liam Bergin]]) tries to kiss her. Whitney decides to stay at The Vic and Lee apologises to Whitney the next day for his behaviour. Babe gets the Carters into trouble with the law and when everyone turns against her, she reveals Lee's involvement in the robbery; resulting Johnny to become hostile to Lee. Whitney decides to [[pawnshop|pawn]] her wedding rings so she and Lee can afford a night out.  She invites one of Lee's ex-army friends (\"Beanbag\") and persuades him to offer Lee a job in security after informing them that he is in Dover doing such a job.  Lee thinks that Whitney is flirting with his friend which causes a row.  When Whitney admits that she pawned her wedding ring, she tells Lee that she wishes that he was more like Mick. Lee hits her in a rage of anger and is instantly wracked with guilt. He begs Whitney for forgiveness, but she lays on their bed in silence clearly frightened of Lee. The next day, Whitney decides to forgive Lee on the condition that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of working out their marriage.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Mick tells Lee that the best thing he can do for Whitney is to leave her. Despite this, on his way to work, Lee talks to [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), who gives him advice on his marriage. Lee then treats Whitney to a romantic dinner, and just after asking for the bill, Lee tells Whitney that he has left a surprise for her back at the flat and insists he should go back. While waiting for him to return, Whitney realises that Lee has gone for a long time, so she returns to their flat, only to find all of his belongings are gone and reads a handwritten note from Lee saying he no longer loves her. Whitney attempts to contact him, to no avail, not knowing that Lee has called Mick requesting to see him. Mick meets Lee, who tells him that he is going to remain in Dover because he cannot stay in Walford. He returns to Walford briefly to see Whitney and tearfully explains the situation. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. After saying a tearful farewell to his family, Lee leaves after Mick tells him that Walford will always be his home.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Lee attempts to call Whitney but the pub's new manager [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal and Whitney agrees, deciding it is time to move on from Lee.\n\nOver two-and-a-half years later, during Christmas, Mick contacts Lee and asks him to come back to Walford to surprise Linda. However, he returns to find her in a drunken, unconscious state on the ground. Lee rushes her mother to hospital and questions her and Mick repeatedly about her behaviour. He also confesses that he is in a relationship with a woman named Sophie. Linda denies having a drink problem. Lee soon discovers that Mick has been having panic attacks and is shocked to see the animosity between his parents. He admits to Linda that he once tried to commit suicide as he felt he could not talk to anyone, and he urges her to talk to Mick. Meanwhile, Whitney is angry with Lee for not talking to her about their divorce and blaming her for the breakdown of their marriage. Lee apologises to her, saying that she did not deserve the way he treated her. Whitney then admits that she is scared to leave her house, due to being stalked by [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tony Wells). Lee advises her to fight back. Buoyed by Lee's advice, Whitney dresses up for New Year's Eve and Lee is proud of her and they agree to be friends. On New Year's Eve, Linda becomes unhealthily drunk and is even disorderly with Mick and Lee. Lee departs the Square once again after advising Linda to stop arguing with Mick.\n\n==Donna Yates==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = EastEnders\n|name = Donna Yates\n|image       =\n|portrayer = [[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]\n|introducer = [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]\n|classification = [[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 2018|Former; regular]]\n|years= 2014\u20132018\n|first= Episode 4837 <br> 14 April 2014\n|last= Episode 5745 <br> 20 July 2018\n|occupation= Market stall holder\n|adoptivemother= [[Claudette Hubbard]] (foster)\n|brothers= [[Vincent Hubbard]] (foster)<br />[[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Glen2|Glen]] (foster)<br />[[Linford Short]] (foster)\n<!-- Please do not add Pearl.

[[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) assumes she is from the council and questions her. When she discovers she is a stallholder, she is furious to discover that the Spring Lane stallholders already know about the decision to merge. Later, Donna is hostile towards Kat and [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) as she also sells clothes. When the Spring Lane traders arrive, [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) asks Donna to wear a black [[armband]] as a mark of respect for [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who has recently been killed. However, Donna refuses as she does not want to put buyers off. It later becomes clear that Donna fancies [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and takes a disliking to Terry's former wife, [[Nikki Spraggan]] ([[Rachel Wilde]]). Donna is later rude about [[Patrick Trueman]]'s ([[Rudolph Walker]]) stroke, and clashes with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]), a fellow stall holder. Donna's one ally on the market is [[#Pam Coker|Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]), a former social worker who now has a flower stall there. It is later revealed that Pam was once Donna's social worker and placed her with her long-term foster family. Pam helps Donna see the brighter side of life, encouraging her to make peace with Kat and getting her a date for Valentine's Day. After Donna and Fatboy clash when he is looking after the Beales' fruit and vegetable stall Pam encourages the two to make amends, with Donna offering an olive branch by helping Fatboy with his supplier receipts. Later, Donna lies about a salon appointment to go to the hospital but when she cannot find a taxi, Fatboy drives her. She confesses to Fatboy privately that she goes to the hospital regularly for blood tests and painkiller injections in hopes of prolonging the energy she has before undergoing joint replacement, and that she did not want Pam to worry about her.\n\nPam plans a party for Donna's 30th birthday, where [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) shows an interest in her. When it becomes clear this is only down to Martin trying to annoy his estranged wife [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), Fatboy punches him, and an upset Donna leaves the party. However, she is pleased when Pam reveals she has secretly invited her foster mother [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), and is touched when Fatboy gives her a hoodie as his present to her. Her foster brother, [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]), visits her and reveals that he is [[Kim Fox]]'s ([[Tameka Empson]]) husband and the father of Kim's daughter [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]], leaving her shocked. She later goes for a drink with Vincent, to the surprise of Kim, who confronts the pair believing that Donna is Vincent's date. Donna reveals that she is Vincent's sister and when Donna calls Kim's half-sister [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) a \"dog\", Kim stabs a tyre on Donna's wheelchair with a fork. Vincent invites Donna to Kim's birthday party at The Albert, where she upsets Kim by revealing Vincent's involvement with [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]).\n\nAfter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) 22nd birthday party, Donna and Fatboy kiss and end up having sex. The next morning, they enjoy the gossip around them, but Fatboy feels that it is making their friendship awkward, and later tells Donna this, but she does not take it well and goes to Claudette's house in tears, saying that she wants a long-term relationship with someone who will love her for who she is. Donna then finds Pam's husband, [[Les Coker]] ([[Roger Sloman]]) in her house in just his underwear, and concludes that they are having an affair, but despite them both denying it, she tells Pam what she saw. When Vincent finds out about Fatboy's treatment of Donna, he angrily confronts him and locks him in a staircase as punishment. The next day, on Vincent's advice, Fatboy tells Donna that he will now be known as Arthur and will be showing his true self to her from now on. Although initially confused, Donna accepts this. However, the relationship does not last and Fatboy soon leaves Walford. Donna is confused when Claudette disappears, so Vincent says that Claudette left after an argument with Kim and is staying with her sister Cynthia, but Donna discovers this is a lie. Donna later reveals to Vincent that Claudette had told her that Vincent buried her in his basement after she fell down the stairs during a scuffle with Patrick. Vincent says Claudette killed her husband, Henry, but Donna does not believe him, so he reveals that Claudette had indirectly killed Fatboy. Donna tells Vincent and Claudette to leave, but Patrick arrives and confirms that Vincent is telling the truth about Henry. Claudette claims Henry's death was an accident and threatens to go to the police if Patrick calls the police on her, but Donna accuses Claudette of only fostering her to ease her guilt. Vincent tells Claudette to leave Walford, and gives Donna Fatboy's necklace. Donna tells him they should stick together as he is now the only family she has left. However, several months later, Claudette returns to Walford and Donna starts meeting her in secret, but fails to convince Vincent to talk to Claudette.\n\nWhen there is no market inspector, the market turns to anarchy, upsetting Donna. She fails to do anything about it and gets drunk, later asking [[#Kush Kazemi|Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) to father a child for her, but she regrets it the next day. Pam encourages Donna to apply to be market inspector. Donna later asks Vincent if he will be the father of her baby. He eventually agrees and reluctantly tells Kim the plan, who is against it. Kim calls Claudette to try to stop the plan but Claudette is supportive despite Vincent still hating her, and Vincent manages to convince Kim. Donna inseminates herself with Vincent's donated sperm, and Kim, realising how hard it will be on her family, attempts to stop it but she is too late. However, Donna does not get pregnant. Donna is determined to keep trying but when she finds out [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) is pregnant and Whitney says she would not be able to raise a baby on her own, Donna realises she will not be able to look after a baby by herself and decides to stop trying for a baby, with Kim reassuring her that she will find the right man. When a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct, Vincent finds parts of Donna's wheelchair when helping the injured.  He eventually finds her lying conscious in the alleyway of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub.\n\n==Shrimpy==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = EastEnders\n|name = Shrimpy\n|portrayer = Ben Champniss\n|introducer = [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]\n|classification = [[List of EastEnders characters#Named extras|Present; extra]]\n|years= 2014\u2013\n|first= Episode 4837 <br> 14 April 2014\n|occupation= Market stall holder\n}}\n'''Shrimpy''', played by Ben Champniss, made his first appearance on 14 April 2014{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--> as an extra, whose occupation is a market trader on Bridge Street after it is merged with the Spring Lane market.

She is delighted that her husband Les has bought 53 Turpin Road for their funeral parlour. The following week, the couple move into the upstairs flat, and Pam opens up her flower stall as the Spring Lane street market has been merged with the Bridge Street market. Pam is not in competition with anyone. She enjoys listening to the arguments and gossip between other rival stall holders. While Pam babysits for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), she discovers photographs of the recently murdered [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) behind Billy's fridge. Pam confronts Billy who explains that the photographs of Lucy are not his but are her twin brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]]'s ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]). Pam befriends [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and helps her organise a naked charity calendar, posing nude herself with [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]) for the month of April. She becomes upset when [[#DC Emma Summerhayes|DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) tells her that secrets always have a habit of revealing themselves. On the anniversary of her son, Lawrie's, death, she goes missing with [[Janet Mitchell|Janet]]. When she returns with Janet, Billy is upset with her. Pam discloses to Emma that she used to be a social worker until accusations were made that she brought about the death of Lawrie, her terminally ill son; telling Emma that the accusations were false, but confessing to Billy that they were true. When Billy discovers the funeral parlour is in trouble because Les cannot bring himself to push bereaved families to pay overdue bills, Billy insists Les tell Pam the truth. Les is unwilling to upset Pam on their anniversary, but eventually confesses, and the pair agree to have no more secrets. However, Les is then revealed to be secretly meeting another woman to whom he gives a necklace. When Pam organises a 30th birthday party for [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) soon afterwards, she secretly invites Donna's foster mother [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) \u2013 the same woman Les is secretly meeting. It is then revealed that Pam placed Donna in Claudette's care when she was a social worker and that the two are good friends.\n\nLes and Pam's grandson, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), comes to stay in Walford with them after a two-year absence, despite animosity between him and Les as he believed he had found out Les and Claudette were having an affair before his departure. Two months later, Paul tells Pam that Les is having an affair with Claudette. Pam tries to confront Claudette about the affair, but loses her nerve. Pam uneasily tells Paul to stop thinking about the affair but later freaks out when she sees Claudette in the photo with her and Les in the newspaper, and admits to Paul that he is, in fact, right about it. Pam tries to arrange a dinner with Les and Claudette, but they both decline, secretly meeting up at Claudette's house. Pam finds Les' tie at Claudette's house and they both give conflicting explanations to her. She later goes to stay with her sister [[Mim Crabbe]] (Helen Cotterill), returning to find Les and Claudette together, with Claudette encouraging Les to tell Pam the truth. Les tries to explain that he and Claudette grew close after Lawrie's death when he needed someone to talk to, but it has only ever been platonic. Pam seeks advice from single mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), who encourages her to work on her marriage and seek some more answers from Les. Pam then issues Les an ultimatum: he must stop seeing Claudette or she will leave him. On Lawrie's birthday, Pam is too upset to speak to Les, so he visits Claudette. Donna finds Les in his underwear at Claudette's house, and tells Pam what she has seen. Pam then goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying Les's gifts until Claudette says they are not hers and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam confronts Les, she is horrified to discover that Christine is his [[Transvestism|feminine alter ego]] and that he enjoys wearing women's clothes, and tells Les he disgusts her, but restrains herself from telling Paul. The next day, she is still not coping with the revelation, but Donna and Claudette encourage her to speak to Les about it. After speaking to Les, she decides she wants to \"meet\" Christine. Whilst preparing Les for the \"meeting\", Claudette comforts a worried Pam, telling her the first time she \"sees\" Christine will be easier than she thinks. Upon \"meeting\" Christine, Pam is initially cautious, but after Les, as Christine, explains that this is how he can cope with things, as Christine is more open than Les, and he is still the same person, she becomes slightly more reciprocate. However, when Paul walks in on them and is horrified, Pam realises she knows nothing about her husband in his feminine form, so leaves to get some distance from Les. She stays with Donna overnight and then makes plans to visit Mim again, although Paul arrives at the train station to stop her. She later returns home to talk to Les, but when she gets hesitant again, Les moves out to give Pam some space and time as her friends and her job are clearly in Walford.\n\nPaul makes efforts to reunite Pam and Les but it is tense and awkward. When Paul suddenly becomes withdrawn from them, they both confront him and he confesses his relationship with [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), revealing he is in love with him. Les urges Paul to tell Ben his feelings, leaving Pam impressed with Les' approach at advice. Les admits to Pam that he is still in love with her, and she says she loves him too, but she is not ready to get back together with him yet. After another encounter with Les at the pub, where she admits she is unable to get the image of Christine out of her head when she sees him, Les calls Pam, telling her to meet at the allotments where he plans to burn Christine's things. She reluctantly watches as Les burns the things and allows him to walk her home. Several days later, Pam allows Les to move back in with her, but as she is still not ready to consummate their marriage, she orders single beds for her and Les. However, Pam and Les starts being blackmailed by [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) after she finds a photograph of Les dressed as Christine at the allotments and she regularly demands money from them. Pam is then shocked to see Paul's estranged biological mother [[Jenny Rawlinson]] (Amy Marston) in Walford and she demands to meet Paul, but Pam refuses.

She is the [[Family Liaison Officer|Police Family Liaison Officer]] for [[Beale family|the Beales]] after [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) is [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?|murdered]].\n\nEmma first appears with her colleague [[#Cameron Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]), to inform [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) that his daughter Lucy has been found dead on Walford Common. Emma supports the Beales as they mourn Lucy's death and becomes familiar with the residents of Albert Square during the early days of the investigation. However, she meets [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) in the Bridge Street caf\u00e9 and they both strike a bond after she confides in him about the breakdown of her engagement. Emma and Max begin a relationship but they keep it secret because Max is a suspect in the investigation and she knows that it could put Emma's job at risk. Emma gets a new boss, [[Samantha Keeble|DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]), who dislikes Emma. She is further worried when she discovers Keeble had investigated Max before.\n\nMax is suspicious of [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]) and the two have a rivalry but Charlie discovers Emma and Max's relationship, which infuriates Max. Emma does a background check on Charlie and finds out that he is [[police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]]. Emma tries to arrest him but he tells Emma he is a Special Operations Officer and threatens to report her unless she breaks up with Max. Emma, frightened at the prospect of losing her job, ends her relationship with Max who retaliates by placing an anonymous call to the police about their affair. Emma is immediately taken off the case and is suspended from the force. Max tries to reconcile with Emma, but she reveals that she is still engaged to her fianc\u00e9, who turns out to be DS Cameron Bryant. Emma tells Max that she loves him and has left Bryant for good because of the way that he treated her when they were together. Emma then introduces Max and his daughters, [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) and [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]), to her parents, [[#Henry Summerhayes|Henry]] ([[Will Knightley]]) and [[#Margot Summerhayes|Margot]] ([[Jill Baker]]), who initially dislike Max. However, they eventually accept him and Emma moves from [[Clapham]] into Max's home. Whilst she is facing a disciplinary hearing, Keeble asks Emma to give hand over Lauren's laptop; something Emma refuses to do as it is breaking the police rules. However, when reminded that she could lose her job, Emma gives Keeble the laptop, but soon regrets this and later confesses to Lauren what she has done. The police find suspicious activity on Lucy's social media site, which was down to [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), but they also discover that Abi knew about Max and Lucy's affair. Despite helping Keeble, Emma loses her job.\n\nBryant tells Emma it was Max that placed the anonymous phonecall to the police about their relationship, and she angrily ends her relationship with him due to this. However, she finds an anonymous envelope addressed to her, which was posted by [[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), containing proof that Lauren was not truthful about her alibi. After viewing the clip, Emma shows it to Lauren, who tells her that she went to the Beale household because she wanted a drink and wanted to see Lucy. However, Lauren worries that Emma is just using her to spy on her family. Later that night, Max admits to Emma that her passion for her job is what made him fall in love with her, and that he only acted out of fear of losing her. She later admits to Max that she is also scared of their relationship not ending well, and both admit neither of them want it to end, so agree to try to start again from scratch. Emma spends Christmas Day with the Branning and Beale families, but ends up asking questions about Lucy, which upset the others. She then arranges drinks in [[The Queen Victoria]] pub with both families, and uses it as an opportunity to pry. [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) takes umbrage and points out that Emma is no longer a police officer and the murder investigation is no longer any of her business. However, after an argument breaks out in between Ian and [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]), Emma makes a discovery and rushes home. She finds the case notes of the murder investigation and solves the case. Emma makes a phonecall to an unknown person, telling them, \"I know you killed Lucy\". On New Year's Day 2015, Emma meets with the suspect in the park in an attempt to convince them to go to the police. Emma later texts the suspect stating that she cannot keep the secret any longer. She is then hit by a car driven by [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), that has been tampered with by [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]). Emma initially appears to be fine but she later collapses. Max takes Emma to hospital after she bleeds from the ear but she later dies from a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]].\n\nIn February 2015, shortly after Ian's wedding to Jane, he finds out that his son [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) killed Lucy and that Jane has been covering for him. Jane admits to meeting with Emma at the park on New Year's Day in an attempt to stop her going to the police. She reveals that Emma suspected she lied about her alibi about her being at [[Masood Ahmed]]'s ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) house at the time because Max had video footage showing that her car was not there.

When Charlie and Yvonne leave, it is clear that something is suspicious, as Charlie asks whether Dot had believed what Yvonne has said. They also imply that Yvonne has been hurt by a member of Dot's family. Over the next few months, Charlie continues to see Dot and she gets used to having him around. It is revealed that Nick is alive, though Charlie and Yvonne have staged his death. Yvonne asks Charlie to stop seeing Dot, as she thinks that Nick has tracked them down. He agrees to go to Ireland with her, but later decides to move in with Dot, implying that Yvonne has left alone. Several months later, Yvonne returns again and is not very pleased when she finds out that Charlie is engaged to [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and that she is pregnant with his child. When Nick returns to Walford and demands money, so that he can leave the country, Yvonne applies for a temporary cleaning job and moves in with Dot and Charlie, to help raise the cash. Dot decides to forgive Charlie for what he has done to her, but reveals to Nick that if he does not leave the country by New Year's Day, then she will hand him into the police. Yvonne and Nick warm to each other again, partly through their hatred of Ronnie.

She accuses Linda of having an affair with him, revealing that she cheated on Linda's deceased father John before his death. Linda denies this passionately and Elaine believes her, but still sensing something is wrong, warns Dean to stay away from Linda. She returns to Walford in December and finds out that Linda was raped. Elaine then allows Mick and Linda to stay with her for a while to escape the Square. Elaine returns for an event at The Vic, and then again when Linda has her five-month scan. After the scan, she breaks down to Elaine, revealing her fears that the baby is Dean's, not Mick's.

However, later that day, Babe plays a recording on her mobile phone to Elaine, the Carters and the pub's customers of Jason persuading her to help him rob the pub, revealing their one-night stand in the process. Elaine is furious and slaps Babe for humiliating her and for cheating with her fianc\u00e9, before Mick orders Jason to leave. Linda then persuades Elaine to listen to Babe's version of events, which reveal that she did not have sex with Jason, but they came close. Elaine manages to forgive Babe, but when Jason arrives for his belongings, she, Babe and Linda are all stunned at how remorseless he is for hurting the family. Linda throws Jason out.\n\nElaine is thrilled when Linda and Mick plan to marry, but causes tension when she tries to take over the planning.

He is attracted to [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]), despite her coy nature, and helps with the cooking for her brother [[Tamwar Masood|Tamwar]]'s ([[Himesh Patel]]) birthday to impress her. Kush helps Martin's wife [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) to arrange a nude charity calendar, and convinces her by walking naked through the market. As they bond over the idea, Sonia attempts to kiss him, and then admits that she is having trouble in her marriage. Kush encourages her to forget about it, and later takes part in the charity calendar along with Sonia. In an attempt to give Shabnam some Christmas spirit, he kisses her, but keeps this from his friends. Kush pushes Shabnam on her feelings for him, and she later has a one-night stand with him as she is upset over losing her job. She rejects him after, feeling guilty for betraying her religious views, until Kush convinces her to start a relationship. They keep it a secret, until [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) rumbles them and they decide to tell Shabnam's family. However, Shabnam's father [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) hears it from [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) first, and is angry at them for keeping it a secret. Shabnam persuades Masood to accept them but ends up lying that Kush has proposed to her. When he tells her that it is happening too fast, as they have only been dating a short while, Shabnam is devastated at her actions and Masood throws him out. Afterwards, Kush confides in Martin that he is not ready for another marriage after the death of his first wife, Safirah. At Donna's 30th birthday party, he gets drunk and when Shabnam tries to talk to him, he tells her that he is still grieving over the loss of his wife. Eventually, Shabnam admits that she does not want to get married; she only lied about the proposal because she loves him. They decide to take things more slowly. Masood comes round to this, but tells them that he does not want to see Shabnam getting heartbroken. However, Kush later proposes to Shabnam after learning of her daughter from Stacey, whom he had earlier kissed.\n\nAfter kissing Stacey a second time and regretting it, Kush finds out that Shabnam is five months pregnant with their child. He has initial doubts about this, but they soon begin planning their wedding. Seven months into her pregnancy, Shabnam's baby dies, leaving Kush heartbroken. Shabnam gives birth to their son, [[Zaair Kazemi|Zaair]], but Kush is unable to cope and leaves the room. He visits Zaair later, cuddling him and telling him how proud he is. Shabnam and Kush argue because he was not there for her and she plans to move to Pakistan, while he considers returning to Essex with Carmel. However, Carmel and Masood get them to reunite. Shabnam rearranges their wedding, hoping that being married will help them gain custody of her daughter [[Jade Green (EastEnders)|Jade Green]] (Amaya Edward). Kush thinks they are marrying for the wrong reasons, but they agree that they love each other and want to marry. Before the wedding, Shabnam tells Kush that Stacey's baby is not Martin's, and Stacey tells him she thinks he could be the father. Stacey swears a reluctant Kush to secrecy and he marries Shabnam and departs with her for their honeymoon. When Kush and Shabnam return, Kush learns on the day of Jade's hearing that Shabnam took Jade without permission. Kush and Shabnam decide not to go for custody of Jade when they realise they have not come to terms with Zaair's death.\n\nWhen Stacey's son [[Arthur Fowler (2015 character)|Arthur Fowler]] is born, Shabnam thinks Kush could be the father from his behaviour, and confronts Stacey, worried she will lose her husband, but Stacey tells her he is not the father, so Shabnam finds Kush and passionately kisses him. However, Shabnam later hears Kush talking to Carmel about Arthur being his son, and Shabnam begins to re-evaluate her marriage. She wants to tell Martin the truth about Arthur's paternity, but when Stacey's mental condition worsens, she and Kush agree to wait and Kush vows to prioritise Shabnam over Arthur. Kush suggests to Shabnam that they move away, but she decides to leave on her own, urging Kush to stay for Arthur. Masood finds out about this and Arthur's paternity, so punches Kush and threatens to kill him if he comes near Shabnam again, and tells him that Shabnam has already decided to leave Walford. Kush then breaks down in Carmel's arms, thinking he has lost Shabnam for good. Despite Kush's pleas, Shabnam leaves Walford with Jade after planting a tree in Zaair's memory, telling Kush that they must lead separate lives, but she still loves him. Kush then starts drinking heavily and Martin finds out that Kush is Arthur's father. Stacey tells Kush that he can be a part of Arthur's life, but Martin disagrees and breaks his friendship with Kush. An emotional Kush has sex with [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]), but she suffers an epileptic fit in his bed. Kush calls Nancy's former boyfriend, Tamwar, who calls Kush selfish. Kush realises he is a bad role model so tells Stacey and Martin that he wants nothing to do with Arthur. Tamwar calls Carmel, who agrees to move in with Kush. Carmel then reveals to Kush that his father has sold their house and she is homeless.\n\nKush develops feelings for Carmel's best friend [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). They admit their feelings to each other and they have a brief fling, however, she ends it, fearing it will ruin her friendship with Carmel. Kush later discovers from Carmel that Denise is pregnant and believes he is the father, but Denise tells him he is not as she is 18 to 19 weeks pregnant. Kush later advises his younger brother [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) when he wants to have sex with his girlfriend, [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]), who is Martin's daughter. When the explicit image Shakil sent to Bex goes viral around Shakil's school, Bex is blamed, even though [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) was the one who sent it. This causes things to become fraught yet again between the Kazemis and the Fowlers.\n\nKush pursues Denise again but she turns him down due to her friendship with Carmel. However, when Kush is in the fish and chip shop after having a drink with Denise, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) crashes into it, leaving him unconscious. Denise helps rescue Kush, and while he is in hospital, she admits her feelings for him and they start a relationship. Back home, Carmel interrupts Kush and Denise one morning, but assumes that Kush has met a doctor from the hospital, which he confirms. Denise tells Kush that they should admit to their relationship from the start, so they tell Carmel, who is shocked, and says that when the relationship ends, she would be forced to take Kush's side and would lose her friend forever. Kush asks Denise to move in with him but she declines where Kush accuses her of comparing him to her controlling ex-husband, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]). Kush storms off and goes into cardiac arrest in the middle of the market, and is diagnosed with [[Brugada Syndrome]]. Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Later, Kush's other brother, [[Darius Kazemi (EastEnders)|Darius Kazemi]] (Ash Rizi), offers him work in [[Dubai]] but Kush and Carmel are left devastated when Shakil, while returning a stolen bike taken by his friend, dies after being stabbed by a gang.\n\nWhen Kush and Denise end their relationship, he begins having a secret sexual relationship with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]). The pair decide to keep it a secret due to the complicated relationship Kush has with the Slaters and Fowlers, but when they are caught having sex, they admit to being together. When Kush sees [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) being harassed on a balcony by [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tom Wells), he rushes to her defence, and accidentally pushes Leo over the balcony. \n\n===Reception===\nGhadami was nominated for Best Newcomer at the [[British Soap Awards]] in 2015 for his portrayal as Kush,<ref name=BSA15longlist>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a644158/eastenders-tops-british-soap-awards-2015-shortlist.html#~pmHjqnxY6Eyupb EastEnders tops British Soap Awards 2015 shortlist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but lost out to ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''{{'}} Jessica Regan, who plays [[Niamh Donoghue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/a647772/who-won-at-british-soap-awards-2015-see-the-winners-list-in-full/|title=Who won at British Soap Awards 2015?

On a day release, he stays overnight in Shirley's caravan, but is unknowingly kidnapped when Mick and Dean tow the caravan away, believing Shirley to be inside. In [[Walford]], after talking with Buster about his longtime association with the Carters, Dean works it out that Buster is his father. They bond and plan with Shirley to escape together. Mick alerts the authorities and Buster is arrested for not reporting back after his day release and is given a month's extra prison sentence. Buster then realises that Mick is his son as well. Buster later returns to Walford on with Dean<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pwlv5 BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 03/04/2015<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and explains that Dean visited him in prison and that after he got released, he booked a one-way ticket to Greece for him, Shirley and Dean to start a new life together. Later, when Dean decides to visit his grandfather, [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]), at the hospital, Buster takes him there, while Shirley packs at home. When the police arrive at the hospital and arrest Dean for breaking bail conditions (following his arrest for raping Linda), Buster thinks that Mick called them, and confronts him and his fianc\u00e9e [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) the next day. When they explain that they did not call the police, Buster works out that it was, in fact, Shirley who called the police, and confronts her at home. Furious, he goes to the train station to leave for Greece alone, where Mick and Linda's children, [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) and [[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), follow him and explain that they need to be there for Stan. Later that night, Buster unexpectedly shows up at Shirley's flat, having had a change of heart and deciding to be there for Dean. He subsequently visits and supports Dean throughout his time in prison, informing him when Stan dies and helps keep Dean's salon, Blades, afloat with Shirley.  After Dean is released without charge, Shirley's aunt [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) organises a party for him in Blades, during which a man throws a brick through the window. Buster discovers that Babe paid the man, so he visits Babe at the Carters' pub, [[The Queen Victoria]], and pours her trifle over her head. When Mick's son [[Ollie Carter]] is born, Buster begins to bond with Mick when he helps him build a cot. Buster discovers that he has another grandchild from Dean and [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). Upon discovering that she suffers from [[cystic fibrosis]], Dean breaks down in Buster's arms. After Dean attacks his fianc\u00e9e [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Buster realises he is a rapist and disowns him. He later visits him in prison where he and Shirley warn him not to contact them and Buster says that he has friends in prison that could make Dean's life hell. When [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) decides to sell his restaurant to a supermarket chain, Buster leads a campaign to stop from him selling, during which he and Ian's mother, [[Kathy Sullivan (EastEnders)|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), become attracted to each other. Buster later propositions Kathy for a secret relationship as he believes he is with the wrong woman and begins secretly meeting her without telling Shirley. When he sees Kathy's estranged husband [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) take Kathy in his car, he tells Gavin's daughter [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), and fearing for Kathy's safety, they go to Gavin's address. When they get there, a woman falls from the balcony onto the car and lies dead on the ground, and Buster thinks it is Kathy. However, it is Gavin's sister [[Margaret Midhurst]] ([[Jan Harvey]]), and Buster finds Kathy hiding in one of the rooms and helps her escape Gavin's house. Later, Kathy tells Buster she needs to end their relationship because she feels things between them are getting too serious. However, they passionately kiss and are seen by Kathy's former husband [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). They start to see each other secretly and eventually sleep together. However, when Kathy's son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) is attacked in a homophobic attack, she ends the affair, leaving Buster heartbroken. Lee realises Buster is cheating on Shirley and tells Mick, who confronts Buster, but Buster does not reveal Kathy's identity. Mick urges Buster to confess to Shirley or he will have nothing to do with him any more. Realising that he no longer loves Shirley, Buster opts for the latter and decides to leave Walford with Kathy. However she leaves Buster heartbroken again when she chooses to remain with her family, so Buster leaves alone.<ref name=\"23sep16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 23/09/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ws5xg |series=EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Jennie Darnell; Writer: Wendy Granditer |station=[[BBC]] |network=[[BBC One]] |airdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sylvie Carter==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=EastEnders\n|name=Sylvie Carter\n|portrayer=[[Linda Marlowe]]\n|introducer=[[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]\n|classification=[[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 2017|Former; regular]]\n|years= 2014\u20132017\n|first=Episode 4974 <br> 11 December 2014\n|last= Episode 5467 <br> 30 March 2017\n|family=[[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carter]]\n|mother=Edna Smith\n|sisters=[[Babe Smith]]\n|husband=[[Stan Carter]] (until 2015)\n|daughters=[[Shirley Carter]]<br />[[Tina Carter]]\n|grandsons=[[Mick Carter]]<br>[[Dean Wicks]]\n|relatives=[[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]]<br />[[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]]<br>[[Nancy Carter]]<br />[[Ollie Carter]]}}\n\n'''Sylvie Carter''', portrayed by [[Linda Marlowe]], is the estranged wife of already established character, [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) and is the mother of [[Shirley Carter|Shirley]] ([[Linda Henry]]), [[Tina Carter|Tina]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) and was also thought to be the mother of her grandson, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), until May 2014.

In December 2014, Shirley and Mick visit their aunt, Sylvie's sister, [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]), and discover that she has been living with her, since her diagnosis of [[Alzheimer's disease]], five years previously. Although she is still hostile towards Shirley, she takes a shine to Mick and when he cannot get hold of Babe, he and Shirley take Sylvie back to their home in Walford. Babe is angry to discover this, especially when she goes missing and when Sylvie is found, Babe takes her home. On Christmas Eve, Mick, Shirley and Babe take Sylvie out for lunch, to which Mick gets her a present, but Sylvie remains hostile to Shirley. At the end of the meal, Sylvie tells Mick that she wants to spend Christmas with him and his family and Babe brings her to their pub, [[The Queen Victoria]], the following day, upsetting Stan. When Stan learns the truth about Mick's parentage, as he is Shirley's biological son, he blames Babe, who then abandons Sylvie and she moves in with them. Later, Stan attempts to talk to Sylvie, but she ignores him and this causes him to snap at her. When Babe eventually decides to take Sylvie home, she informs Stan that he did make her happy, before leaving, returning briefly for a dance party at the local community centre, where she kisses Stan. Babe is angry that Sylvie has left home, without her permission and also reveals that she had a crush on Stan, before him and Sylvie became a couple. When Babe announces that she is struggling to take care of Sylvie and that she is going to put her into a care home, they arrange a leaving party for her and her and Stan reminisce, about how they used to love each other. When Shirley sits down and explains to Mick why she could not be a mother to him, revealing that it was Sylvie and Babe's fault, as they tried to cause her to miscarry, by pushing her down the stairs, and would not even let her hold him, when she had just given birth to him, he disowns them.\n\nIn April 2015, Babe takes Sylvie to see Stan, who is [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], in a hospice, in the hope of causing trouble between him and his new fianc\u00e9e, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]). However, Stan and Sylvie admit to each other that they made the right decision to separate and take off each other's wedding rings, before saying an emotional goodbye. Sylvie later appears when Babe returns from Stan's funeral and reveals to Sylvie that Stan has died. It transpires that Babe did not tell Sylvie about Stan's death straight away, because she wanted to attend his funeral without her. When Sylvie tries to visit the rest of the Carter family to comfort them, Babe becomes hostile and orders her to stay put. When Sylvie exclaims that no man would ever love her, Babe slaps her and she then pretends to be upset and holds her cheek in pain, leading to Babe hugging her, only for Sylvie to bite her neck as revenge for slapping her. Sylvie then tries to call the police on Babe, as she and [[Queenie Trott]] ([[Judy Cornwell]]), broke the law when they lived in Ramsgate. Babe then manipulates Sylvie into not going through with it.\n\nTina brings Sylvie to Mick and Linda's wedding, though Shirley is angry about this. When asked, Sylvie does not remember why she is there and after being told, she then mistakes Mick's eldest son [[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) for Mick.

Linda becomes worried for the safety of her infant son [[Ollie Carter]] when Sylvie calls him a [[slug]] and threatens to pour salt on him, so Tina allows Sylvie to move in with her and her girlfriend [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), which Sonia finds difficult adapting to. After Babe is locked in the freezer at The Queen Vic, Sylvie makes a trifle and attempts to replace Babe's status in the family. Babe's memory from the attack eventually returns, and tells Mick and Linda that it was Sylvie who locked her in the freezer. After Sylvie seemingly confesses to attacking Babe and arguing with Shirley, it is revealed that [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) was the real culprit, with Babe framing Sylvie in an attempt to have her sent back to a care home. Eventually, Sonia breaks up with Tina and moves to [[Kettering]], so Tina and Sylvie move out of the house and in with Shirley, after her relationship with [[#Buster Briggs|Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]) ends.\n\nBabe looks after Sylvie, who insults Babe, so Babe convinces her they are meeting Stan and takes her in the rain to a canal, leaving her there. Sylvie is later found and brought back home, where she is scared of Babe.

He tells Tamwar that there are plans to merge the street markets and not to tell anyone. However, Tamwar's sister [[Shabnam Masood|Shabnam]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]), leaks the news causing the market traders to rally together, led by [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]). He and [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) rent a flat together. Aleks dates [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), on orders from her sister, [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]). When Ronnie calls their relationship off, Aleks is annoyed. When Ronnie fails to meet Roxy as planned, she calls Aleks and he comes to her rescue. The pair end up having sex, which infuriates Ronnie.\n\nStruggling to pay the rent, Aleks advertises for a third person to live with him and Jake. [[#Tosh Mackintosh|Fiona \"Tosh\" Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs) later moves in and shocks him when he learns that she is in a relationship with [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]). Later, Roxy discovers that Ronnie paid Aleks and they have an argument but they stay together. Then, Aleks' young daughter, [[#Ineta Shirovs|Ineta]] (Octavia Alexandru) talks to him over video chat, asking if he is coming home. [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) becomes suspicious when he finds Aleks talking to somebody over the Internet in Latvian and he angrily throws Alfie out. Alfie enlists Tamwar's help to hack into Aleks' laptop and see what he is hiding, and Tamwar tells Alfie that he has been contacting his wife. Alfie and Tamwar tell Roxy but she does not believe him, choosing instead to ask Tamwar about Alfie's discovery and he shows her the evidence. Later on, Roxy cooks Aleks a romantic meal and asks about his wife. He reveals he has a daughter, Ineta, and that he is married to Ineta's mother but they are separated. Roxy then throws Aleks out and buys him a plane tickets to Latvia but as he is about to leave, Roxy stops him, saying that she still wants to be with him. Aleks later nearly comes to blows with Alfie after he makes remarks about Aleks' marital status and later gives Alfie's pitch to rival market trader [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]), despite Alfie excusing his absence on the day to illness, causing further tension between them. Roxy asks Aleks to show his commitment to her and he arranges a surprise holiday, proving to Roxy that he's committed and avoiding his wife [[#Marta Shirovs|Marta]] ([[Noeleen Comiskey]]) and their daughter who have arrived from Latvia. Aleks has sex with Marta in his office. Ronnie's partner, [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]), sees him and demands he tells Roxy, but Marta does before he can. She is devastated and throws him out; however, she realises her feelings for him are too strong and invites him to move back in. Marta goes home but leaves Ineta with Aleks, believing she will be better off in England. Aleks supports Charlie after the traumatic birth of his son [[Matthew Mitchell-Cotton|Matthew]] following a car crash and, inspired by Dot, suggests the name Matthew. Charlie's wife, Ronnie, goes into a coma after Matthew's birth. Aleks learns that Roxy and Charlie have slept together so he goes to the hospital to tell Ronnie but cannot bring himself to do so.\n\nTamwar begins to suspects Aleks after he takes an \"advance\" from the market office cash box, Tamwar later studies Aleks' records and works out that Aleks has been taking an extra maintenance fee but there is no record of it on the council receipts and he has been ripping off the traders. Tamwar confronts Aleks about it so he fires Tamwar and throws the evidence in the bin. Later, Tamwar visits Aleks and tells him that he is fired as Tamwar told the authorities about Aleks fiddling the books and the police have been called. Ineta rushes downstairs to answer the door to Marta as she had overheard their conversation about moving away and so called her mum. Roxy is torn between Aleks begging her to go with him and Marta suggesting that she would be breaking up a family and only to leave with Aleks if she loves him.

The character departed the show on 11 December 2014.\n\nAfter arguing with her sister [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), Tina decides to reconnect with Tosh after realising that she still views Tosh as \"a loved one\". She brings Tosh to a family dinner, where she instantly clashes with Shirley, who knows that Tosh can be violent and previously beat Tina when they were together, while befriending Tina's sister-in-law [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]). Shirley visits Tosh at the fire station to warn her to stay away from Tina, but is humiliated by the firefighter who soaks her using a fire hose. Still determined to stop Tina from seeing Tosh, Shirley locks her in the upstairs lounge of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, but Tosh rescues Tina with a fire ladder. As they prepare to spend some time together as a couple, Tina is called to help [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) who has drunk herself paralytic despite being pregnant. Tosh, unwilling to give up her time off, leaves Tina to deal with the situation alone.\n\nTosh later feels insecure about Tina's friendship with [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) despite the fact that she is not a lesbian. In late April 2014, Tosh and Tina agree to spend the night in town. but Tina is caught up with her friend [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and tells Tosh to leave without her. The following day, Tosh shouts at Tina in The Queen Vic and is told to leave by Shirley. She later talks to [[#Aleks Shirovs|Aleks Shirovs]] ([[Kristian Kiehling]]) in The Vic, and they come to a decision that Tosh will move in with him and fellow flatmate [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]), which delights Tina. Later on, Tina also moves in with them. Tosh overhears Sonia and her half-sister [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) talking about a kiss between Tina and Sonia. She is furious with Tina and confronts her, leading to her knocking Tina's head against the door frame. The pair later reconcile and decide to start a family together. Desperate for cash to fund IVF treatment, Tina starts dealing her aunt [[Babe Smith]]'s ([[Annette Badland]]) drugs. Tosh discovers this and struggles to trust Tina again, but eventually forgives her. They choose a sperm donor, and Tosh is inseminated though she worries that their child will not know its father.\n\nShe becomes pregnant, news which they share with Tina's supportive family. When [[Alfie Moon]]'s ([[Shane Richie]]) house is burnt to the ground, Tosh actively stops people from entering the fire. She later reveals to Tina she has miscarried, but plans to try for another baby. She becomes suspicious that Alfie started the fire himself as insurance fraud, and shares her belief with the fire investigation officer before going to the police, despite Tina's brother [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) actively trying to stop her, aware that her suspicions are correct but knowing Alfie's actions were out of desperation. After, when a drunk Dean approaches Tosh and offers to be donor for her and Tina's baby, they agree on the condition of not telling Tina, however the next day at Sharon and Phil's wedding Tosh confesses to Tina about Dean and she is furious. Tina later forgives her, when Tosh discovers she is not pregnant, she punches Tina after accusing her of not being supportive. Tosh becomes paranoid that Tina is having an affair with Sonia when she helps her through body image issues, and she finds Sonia's watch in the flat. She confronts Tina and viciously beats her. Afterwards, she tries to apologise but Tina rejects her, telling her to take a job and a new flat in Croydon.

A week later, it is Lee who saves Stan from a small fire at [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. The family meet at the hospital. When Mick asks him why he punched him, he confirms that he was in Stan's flat. Lee then has sex with [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), however she insists it was a one-night stand. He begins pursuing [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) instead, but later resumes his affair with Lucy. When Lucy is found dead after being murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), the police take a [[DNA profiling|DNA sample]] from Lee, before he returns to the army.\n\nHe returns as a surprise for Linda on her birthday.

Lee, along with his great aunt [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) and her girlfriend [[#Tosh Mackintosh|Tosh Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), confront Billy, but he angrily tells them to leave. In [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) memorial to the commemorate the centenary of [[World War I]], Lee raises and lowers the Union Flag as a memorial. He tries to win back Whitney, but she is still upset about how he abandoned her for Lucy. Eventually, she forgives him, and they begin a relationship. Whitney's adoptive mother [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) protests to the relationship until Lee wins her round. Lee and Whitney have sex, and she confides in him that her estranged brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) is trying to get back in contact with her.\n\nLee is later unhappy when [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) returns to Walford after serving time in prison for killing his father [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) ex-girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]]'s ([[Linda Henry]]) best friend, [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Ferguson]]). Lee's brother [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) shows an interest in him, knowing that he is [[homosexual|gay]], but Ben tells him he is no longer homosexual and insults Johnny with homophobic names, resulting in Lee viciously attacking him. Lee realises that [[Lauren Branning]]'s ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) alibi is suspicious when he views her outside Lucy's house on a video taken on the night of Lucy's death. He also later shares this information with the police investigating Lucy's murder. Lee and [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) later learn that Mick and Linda are not actually married as they had previously thought.\n\nDuring Christmas and the New Year after Johnny's departure to go travelling, Lee and Nancy become paranoid about the situation between their parents and Dean, who believe that Dean has done something wrong. Lee and Nancy are left in charge of The Queen Vic for several weeks while Mick and Linda go on holiday. Nancy is determined to know what Dean has done, but Shirley and Tina refuse to talk to Nancy without Mick and Linda's consent. When Shirley moves Dean in, Nancy is upset by this and Lee tries to talk Nancy into accepting Dean's presence while Mick and Linda are away. After throwing a party, Mick and Linda later return and are horrified to see Shirley behind the bar and Dean drinking in The Queen Vic. After reporting Dean to the police, Linda finally reveals to Lee and Nancy that Dean raped her and it is possible that he could be the father of Linda's unborn baby. Lee is angry to learn of this news and is determined to make Dean pay. Both Lee and Mick's tempers worsen when Dean continues to harass them and their family. Lee and Dean fight in the street when Dean denies attacking Linda and Mick makes it clear to Dean and Shirley to stay away from The Queen Vic, although Shirley decides to instead stand by him when Dean disappears for a few weeks. Lee is later happy when Linda proposes to Mick, who accepts.\n\nLee and his family are upset to learn that Stan has died after he was diagnosed with [[terminal illness|terminal]] [[prostate cancer]]. The feud between Dean, Shirley and Mick continues, which begins to cause disruption for the other members of the Carter family. Dean is arrested on suspicion of breaking his bail conditions, but he is later released from prison. Linda gives birth to a baby boy, later named [[Ollie Carter|Ollie]] (Jack Tilley), after falling down the stairs and Lee is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that the baby may only be his half-brother. Mick talks Lee round to accepting the fact that the baby may be Dean's but he will always be the baby's brother, half or not. Lee is later relieved when he learns that Ollie is not Dean's, and visits Linda and Ollie in hospital, with the company of Nancy and Whitney.\n\nLee begins to develop [[clinical depression]], which leads to him missing work and being discharged from the Army when he punches one of his colleagues who flirts with Whitney. Lee is prescribed medication for his condition but he refuses take it. He gets a job at the local car lot, but Lee develops bitter feelings towards those around him, repeatedly shunning Whitney and his family. His worsening alcoholism nearly gets him sacked from the car lot, but Whitney convinces [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) to give Lee one more chance. Lee's mood improves when he makes a sale at the car lot and is invited to a Halloween party. However, a heavily pregnant [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) is electrocuted by a broken socket that Lee did not fix properly. Stacey's boyfriend [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) punches Lee and threatens to kill him if Stacey's baby dies. Lee breaks down in Whitney's arms when he realises the baby could be dead because of him and confesses to being drunk when fixing the socket, but is relieved when Whitney tells him that the baby and Stacey are not badly injured. He and Whitney are later invited to have lunch with Martin, Stacey, [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]) in The Queen Vic, where Martin apologises to Lee for punching him and forgives him for the incident. Days later, during Dean and [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) engagement party, Lee gets drunk and confronts Shirley after finding out that she and Mick have been seeing each other secretly. During the argument, Lee tries to attack his grandfather [[#Buster Briggs|Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), who escorts him out and takes him to the caf\u00e9. Buster tells Lee that he needs to start taking his anti-depressants and stay focused on his career. He then returns him home and Lee tells Mick that he has no problem with him and Shirley seeing each other. Lee later knocks himself unconscious while trying to eject Dean from the pub, so is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. When he regains consciousness, he overhears Whitney confess to Mick via the baby monitor that she intends to break up with him after Mick and Linda's upcoming wedding, unable to handle his depression. On New Year's Day 2016, the day of the wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee then tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Dean turns up to the wedding after attempting to rape Roxy and pushes Shirley into a nearby lake, and Mick saves them both. The police subsequently arrive and arrest Dean for the attempted rape of Roxy. Later, when Phil turns up at The Queen Vic drunk and demands more drinks, Lee tries to escort him out but Phil, being the owner of the car lot, sacks him. Lee later works alongside Buster at his local fish stall, but sneaks off one afternoon for an interview with local landlady [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Thelma Bragg|Thelma Bragg]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]), whom was initially interested in hiring Nancy. Lee gets the job, but when Nancy, who was covering his shift for Buster, finds out, she calls him a spineless traitor before assuring him that he will not last long given his history of failure. Although Whitney praises Lee for getting the job, he walks away in misery.\n\nTo assist with getting to work, Mick buys Lee a new car, which he takes Whitney for a drive in. During their drive, Whitney confesses to kissing Mick. An enraged Lee finds Mick and Linda at [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) restaurant and tries to attack them both. He later gets drunk and is thrown out of The Albert by [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) for insulting his wife, [[Kim Fox|Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]). He then bumps into an equally drunk [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) and they end up having unprotected sex. Whitney goes to stay with [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), where the next day, Nancy drops the rest of Whitney's belongings off as Lee is unable to face her after what happened with Mick. However, he later sees Abi talking to Whitney, and fears she may have told them about their one-night stand. Abi denies doing so, but tells Lee that Whitney is planning to leave Walford. Lee rushes to Sonia's house and begs Whitney to stay, finally confessing that he has not been taking his anti-depressants. When his family finds out, Mick furiously denounces him for lying, but Lee promises to ensure he gets better from now on. Later, when Whitney comes down to The Queen Vic after talking to Nancy, Lee asks her to marry him, and she accepts. Lee's relationship with Nancy is further tarnished when he reveals he told Thelma about Nancy's epilepsy, which further jeopardised her chances of getting the job. She then leaves The Queen Vic to move in with [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) and works on her market stall. Lee eventually quits his new job following what he believes to be sexual harassment from Thelma, and decides to work at The Queen Vic, taking Nancy's old bartending job. Nancy joins everyone for a Mother's Day meal, but when she finds out Lee took her old job, they have another argument. Lee tells her that he is not surprised her boyfriend [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) left her, prompting Nancy to angrily push Lee. He falls into Ollie's highchair, sending him and Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) crashing to the floor as Nancy and Whitney watch in shock. Mick and Linda rush back to find that Ollie has no apparent injuries, but Nancy and Lee continue to argue despite Mick and Linda's protests. Eventually, Mick loses his temper, smashing a chair and throwing Lee and Nancy out of The Queen Vic. When Linda later finds Ollie not breathing in his cot and later suffers a seizure, the Carters are told that Ollie may have brain damage, after hitting his head severely during Lee and Nancy's fight. Mick blames Nancy for the accident, and after months of feuding, he forgives her, however Nancy and Tamwar leave Walford to go travelling.\n\nWhen Whitney discovers she is pregnant, Lee worries that he would not be a good father due to his depression. They visit the doctors, but both Lee and Whitney are tested positive for [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], which Lee caught from Abi. Lee lets Whitney wrongly believe that she had caught the STI during her past relationship with [[Rob Grayson]] ([[Jody Latham]]), who [[Sexual exploitation|sexually exploited]] her. Abi confesses to Whitney about the one-night stand and she ends her relationship with Lee<ref name=\"1aug16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 01/08/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07n2mcp |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Richard Lynn; Writer: Natalie Mitchell |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 1 August 2016}}</ref> and considers leaving Walford, but after speaking to Linda, she decides to give Lee another chance, saying that having a baby with him would bring her the happiness that she needs.<ref name=\"2aug16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 02/08/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07n2nlh |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Richard Lynn; Writer: Liz Lake |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 2 August 2016}}</ref> To make up for his mistakes, Lee takes Whitney to the registry office to book their wedding date.

Lee tells her how much he wants to look after her and she tells him that she is sure that he will. Lee gets a job, telling everyone he is a sales executive in the city. However, he worries about how he will cope. After his first day at work, Lee uses a credit card to buy Whitney an expensive pair of earrings. Johnny (now [[Ted Reilly]]) worries about the amount of money that Lee is spending on his wedding, but Lee insists he is fine. Lee checks his bank account and sees he is \u00a3250 overdrawn, and then applies for a \u00a32000 payday loan. Lee realises he should be honest with Whitney about the money but he backs out of telling her. When Abi realises Lee is not over Whitney's miscarriage, she tells him she should have told him about the chlamydia as she read that it could have caused the miscarriage, leaving him worried. Lee confronts Whitney over her miscarriage lie, and she admits that she worried how he would cope but now wants complete honesty, to which he agrees. However, he ignores reminders about repaying the loan. Johnny discovers Lee's debts and tells him to be honest with Whitney before they marry the following day.

Trapped in a depressed state, Lee cries at home but keeps the truth from his family. When Whitney surprises Lee at work, she assumes Lee's colleague [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Osman \"Oz\" Bolat|Oz Bolat]] (Noah Maxwell-Clarke) is his employee. Whitney hopes to move to an expensive flat in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] and asks Lee to put a deposit on the flat but knowing he cannot afford it, he does not do so and tells her he was too late. However, [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) offers one of his flats on Albert Square at a reduced rate so Whitney is happy but Lee still knows he cannot afford it. He asks his boss for an advance on his wages but is refused due to his poor performance. Lee then steals a sentimental piece of jewellery from Linda, attempting to pawn it, but he is not offered what he expected. He tells Shirley he cannot afford a flat, so she tells him that Whitney will be happy as long as she has him. He cheers up following Shirley's comment, but when Whitney buys a picture reading \"home sweet home\" for the flat, he steals charity money from the pub and tells Jack he has a deposit. Whitney and Lee move in but he makes excuses not to have sex with her and she worries when his mood swings return. When Whitney seduces Lee, he suffers [[erectile dysfunction]] due to his depression, though Whitney comforts him. Whitney then suspects Lee is having an affair, and when she tries to surprise him by visiting him at work, she finds out he has called in sick. He spends the day hiding in the allotments, briefly encountering [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), who tells him that relationships built on lies never last. Whitney confronts Lee, accusing him of having an affair, but he says he was buying her a Christmas present. Whitney believes him and they finally have sex.

While waiting for him to return, Whitney realises that Lee has gone for a long time, so she returns to their flat, only to find all of his belongings are gone and reads a handwritten note from Lee saying he no longer loves her. Whitney attempts to contact him, to no avail, not knowing that Lee has called Mick requesting to see him. Mick meets Lee, who tells him that he is going to remain in Dover because he cannot stay in Walford. He returns to Walford briefly to see Whitney and tearfully explains the situation.

He also confesses that he is in a relationship with a woman named Sophie. Linda denies having a drink problem. Lee soon discovers that Mick has been having panic attacks and is shocked to see the animosity between his parents. He admits to Linda that he once tried to commit suicide as he felt he could not talk to anyone, and he urges her to talk to Mick. Meanwhile, Whitney is angry with Lee for not talking to her about their divorce and blaming her for the breakdown of their marriage.

Later, Donna is hostile towards Kat and [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) as she also sells clothes. When the Spring Lane traders arrive, [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) asks Donna to wear a black [[armband]] as a mark of respect for [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who has recently been killed. However, Donna refuses as she does not want to put buyers off. It later becomes clear that Donna fancies [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and takes a disliking to Terry's former wife, [[Nikki Spraggan]] ([[Rachel Wilde]]). Donna is later rude about [[Patrick Trueman]]'s ([[Rudolph Walker]]) stroke, and clashes with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]), a fellow stall holder. Donna's one ally on the market is [[#Pam Coker|Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]), a former social worker who now has a flower stall there. It is later revealed that Pam was once Donna's social worker and placed her with her long-term foster family. Pam helps Donna see the brighter side of life, encouraging her to make peace with Kat and getting her a date for Valentine's Day. After Donna and Fatboy clash when he is looking after the Beales' fruit and vegetable stall Pam encourages the two to make amends, with Donna offering an olive branch by helping Fatboy with his supplier receipts. Later, Donna lies about a salon appointment to go to the hospital but when she cannot find a taxi, Fatboy drives her. She confesses to Fatboy privately that she goes to the hospital regularly for blood tests and painkiller injections in hopes of prolonging the energy she has before undergoing joint replacement, and that she did not want Pam to worry about her.\n\nPam plans a party for Donna's 30th birthday, where [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) shows an interest in her.

Her foster brother, [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]), visits her and reveals that he is [[Kim Fox]]'s ([[Tameka Empson]]) husband and the father of Kim's daughter [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]], leaving her shocked. She later goes for a drink with Vincent, to the surprise of Kim, who confronts the pair believing that Donna is Vincent's date. Donna reveals that she is Vincent's sister and when Donna calls Kim's half-sister [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) a \"dog\", Kim stabs a tyre on Donna's wheelchair with a fork. Vincent invites Donna to Kim's birthday party at The Albert, where she upsets Kim by revealing Vincent's involvement with [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]).\n\nAfter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) 22nd birthday party, Donna and Fatboy kiss and end up having sex.

Donna then finds Pam's husband, [[Les Coker]] ([[Roger Sloman]]) in her house in just his underwear, and concludes that they are having an affair, but despite them both denying it, she tells Pam what she saw. When Vincent finds out about Fatboy's treatment of Donna, he angrily confronts him and locks him in a staircase as punishment. The next day, on Vincent's advice, Fatboy tells Donna that he will now be known as Arthur and will be showing his true self to her from now on. Although initially confused, Donna accepts this. However, the relationship does not last and Fatboy soon leaves Walford. Donna is confused when Claudette disappears, so Vincent says that Claudette left after an argument with Kim and is staying with her sister Cynthia, but Donna discovers this is a lie. Donna later reveals to Vincent that Claudette had told her that Vincent buried her in his basement after she fell down the stairs during a scuffle with Patrick. Vincent says Claudette killed her husband, Henry, but Donna does not believe him, so he reveals that Claudette had indirectly killed Fatboy. Donna tells Vincent and Claudette to leave, but Patrick arrives and confirms that Vincent is telling the truth about Henry. Claudette claims Henry's death was an accident and threatens to go to the police if Patrick calls the police on her, but Donna accuses Claudette of only fostering her to ease her guilt. Vincent tells Claudette to leave Walford, and gives Donna Fatboy's necklace. Donna tells him they should stick together as he is now the only family she has left. However, several months later, Claudette returns to Walford and Donna starts meeting her in secret, but fails to convince Vincent to talk to Claudette.\n\nWhen there is no market inspector, the market turns to anarchy, upsetting Donna. She fails to do anything about it and gets drunk, later asking [[#Kush Kazemi|Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) to father a child for her, but she regrets it the next day. Pam encourages Donna to apply to be market inspector. Donna later asks Vincent if he will be the father of her baby. He eventually agrees and reluctantly tells Kim the plan, who is against it. Kim calls Claudette to try to stop the plan but Claudette is supportive despite Vincent still hating her, and Vincent manages to convince Kim. Donna inseminates herself with Vincent's donated sperm, and Kim, realising how hard it will be on her family, attempts to stop it but she is too late. However, Donna does not get pregnant. Donna is determined to keep trying but when she finds out [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) is pregnant and Whitney says she would not be able to raise a baby on her own, Donna realises she will not be able to look after a baby by herself and decides to stop trying for a baby, with Kim reassuring her that she will find the right man. When a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct, Vincent finds parts of Donna's wheelchair when helping the injured.  He eventually finds her lying conscious in the alleyway of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub.\n\n==Shrimpy==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = EastEnders\n|name = Shrimpy\n|portrayer = Ben Champniss\n|introducer = [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]\n|classification = [[List of EastEnders characters#Named extras|Present; extra]]\n|years= 2014\u2013\n|first= Episode 4837 <br> 14 April 2014\n|occupation= Market stall holder\n}}\n'''Shrimpy''', played by Ben Champniss, made his first appearance on 14 April 2014{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--> as an extra, whose occupation is a market trader on Bridge Street after it is merged with the Spring Lane market.

She is delighted that her husband Les has bought 53 Turpin Road for their funeral parlour. The following week, the couple move into the upstairs flat, and Pam opens up her flower stall as the Spring Lane street market has been merged with the Bridge Street market. Pam is not in competition with anyone. She enjoys listening to the arguments and gossip between other rival stall holders. While Pam babysits for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), she discovers photographs of the recently murdered [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) behind Billy's fridge. Pam confronts Billy who explains that the photographs of Lucy are not his but are her twin brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]]'s ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]). Pam befriends [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and helps her organise a naked charity calendar, posing nude herself with [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]) for the month of April. She becomes upset when [[#DC Emma Summerhayes|DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) tells her that secrets always have a habit of revealing themselves. On the anniversary of her son, Lawrie's, death, she goes missing with [[Janet Mitchell|Janet]]. When she returns with Janet, Billy is upset with her. Pam discloses to Emma that she used to be a social worker until accusations were made that she brought about the death of Lawrie, her terminally ill son; telling Emma that the accusations were false, but confessing to Billy that they were true. When Billy discovers the funeral parlour is in trouble because Les cannot bring himself to push bereaved families to pay overdue bills, Billy insists Les tell Pam the truth. Les is unwilling to upset Pam on their anniversary, but eventually confesses, and the pair agree to have no more secrets. However, Les is then revealed to be secretly meeting another woman to whom he gives a necklace. When Pam organises a 30th birthday party for [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) soon afterwards, she secretly invites Donna's foster mother [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) \u2013 the same woman Les is secretly meeting. It is then revealed that Pam placed Donna in Claudette's care when she was a social worker and that the two are good friends.\n\nLes and Pam's grandson, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), comes to stay in Walford with them after a two-year absence, despite animosity between him and Les as he believed he had found out Les and Claudette were having an affair before his departure. Two months later, Paul tells Pam that Les is having an affair with Claudette. Pam tries to confront Claudette about the affair, but loses her nerve. Pam uneasily tells Paul to stop thinking about the affair but later freaks out when she sees Claudette in the photo with her and Les in the newspaper, and admits to Paul that he is, in fact, right about it. Pam tries to arrange a dinner with Les and Claudette, but they both decline, secretly meeting up at Claudette's house. Pam finds Les' tie at Claudette's house and they both give conflicting explanations to her. She later goes to stay with her sister [[Mim Crabbe]] (Helen Cotterill), returning to find Les and Claudette together, with Claudette encouraging Les to tell Pam the truth. Les tries to explain that he and Claudette grew close after Lawrie's death when he needed someone to talk to, but it has only ever been platonic. Pam seeks advice from single mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), who encourages her to work on her marriage and seek some more answers from Les. Pam then issues Les an ultimatum: he must stop seeing Claudette or she will leave him. On Lawrie's birthday, Pam is too upset to speak to Les, so he visits Claudette. Donna finds Les in his underwear at Claudette's house, and tells Pam what she has seen. Pam then goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying Les's gifts until Claudette says they are not hers and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam confronts Les, she is horrified to discover that Christine is his [[Transvestism|feminine alter ego]] and that he enjoys wearing women's clothes, and tells Les he disgusts her, but restrains herself from telling Paul. The next day, she is still not coping with the revelation, but Donna and Claudette encourage her to speak to Les about it. After speaking to Les, she decides she wants to \"meet\" Christine. Whilst preparing Les for the \"meeting\", Claudette comforts a worried Pam, telling her the first time she \"sees\" Christine will be easier than she thinks. Upon \"meeting\" Christine, Pam is initially cautious, but after Les, as Christine, explains that this is how he can cope with things, as Christine is more open than Les, and he is still the same person, she becomes slightly more reciprocate. However, when Paul walks in on them and is horrified, Pam realises she knows nothing about her husband in his feminine form, so leaves to get some distance from Les. She stays with Donna overnight and then makes plans to visit Mim again, although Paul arrives at the train station to stop her. She later returns home to talk to Les, but when she gets hesitant again, Les moves out to give Pam some space and time as her friends and her job are clearly in Walford.\n\nPaul makes efforts to reunite Pam and Les but it is tense and awkward. When Paul suddenly becomes withdrawn from them, they both confront him and he confesses his relationship with [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), revealing he is in love with him. Les urges Paul to tell Ben his feelings, leaving Pam impressed with Les' approach at advice. Les admits to Pam that he is still in love with her, and she says she loves him too, but she is not ready to get back together with him yet. After another encounter with Les at the pub, where she admits she is unable to get the image of Christine out of her head when she sees him, Les calls Pam, telling her to meet at the allotments where he plans to burn Christine's things. She reluctantly watches as Les burns the things and allows him to walk her home. Several days later, Pam allows Les to move back in with her, but as she is still not ready to consummate their marriage, she orders single beds for her and Les. However, Pam and Les starts being blackmailed by [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) after she finds a photograph of Les dressed as Christine at the allotments and she regularly demands money from them. Pam is then shocked to see Paul's estranged biological mother [[Jenny Rawlinson]] (Amy Marston) in Walford and she demands to meet Paul, but Pam refuses. When Les suffers a heart attack, Pam and Les decide to let Paul and his boyfriend, Ben, to continue with the family business at the funeral parlour. Following a night out with Ben, Paul is later killed off-screen in a suspected homophobic attack. Initially, Pam denies that it is Paul, but later identifies him in the mortuary with Les. When everyone proposes a toast in Paul's memory, Pam blames Ben for causing Paul's death, wishing it was him who had died instead of Paul.<ref name=\"21jul16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 21/07/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lkt4q |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: David Moor; Writer: Laura Poliakoff |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 21 July 2016}}</ref> Pam and Les are later relieved when Claudette helps them expose Babe's blackmail. At Paul's funeral, Pam makes a truce with Ben after hearing his emotional eulogy for Paul and later decides to allow Les to be Christine, realising that she may need him to show this side of his personality.\n\nBefore a bail hearing for Paul's murder, Pam meets a woman in the toilets and comforts her, but later realises she is actually the mother of one of Paul's killers. Paul's killers are refused bail and Pam escorts Les out of the courtroom. When they return home, Pam and Les consider leaving Walford together after the trial is over. Pam decides to visit [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Diane Atmore|Diane Atmore]] (Hazel Ellerby), the mother of [[Simon Atmore]] ([[Tom Palmer (comedian)|Tom Palmer]]), one of Paul's killers, to try to get her to persuade him to plead guilty.

At a farewell party for the Cokers in The Vic, Pam confronts Babe\u2014who has recently returned the money she took from them\u2014and tells her that she is a sad, pathetic old woman who she feels sorry for and that she will never have what she and Les have.

She is the [[Family Liaison Officer|Police Family Liaison Officer]] for [[Beale family|the Beales]] after [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) is [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?|murdered]].\n\nEmma first appears with her colleague [[#Cameron Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]), to inform [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) that his daughter Lucy has been found dead on Walford Common. Emma supports the Beales as they mourn Lucy's death and becomes familiar with the residents of Albert Square during the early days of the investigation. However, she meets [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) in the Bridge Street caf\u00e9 and they both strike a bond after she confides in him about the breakdown of her engagement. Emma and Max begin a relationship but they keep it secret because Max is a suspect in the investigation and she knows that it could put Emma's job at risk. Emma gets a new boss, [[Samantha Keeble|DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]), who dislikes Emma. She is further worried when she discovers Keeble had investigated Max before.\n\nMax is suspicious of [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]) and the two have a rivalry but Charlie discovers Emma and Max's relationship, which infuriates Max. Emma does a background check on Charlie and finds out that he is [[police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]]. Emma tries to arrest him but he tells Emma he is a Special Operations Officer and threatens to report her unless she breaks up with Max. Emma, frightened at the prospect of losing her job, ends her relationship with Max who retaliates by placing an anonymous call to the police about their affair. Emma is immediately taken off the case and is suspended from the force. Max tries to reconcile with Emma, but she reveals that she is still engaged to her fianc\u00e9, who turns out to be DS Cameron Bryant. Emma tells Max that she loves him and has left Bryant for good because of the way that he treated her when they were together. Emma then introduces Max and his daughters, [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) and [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]), to her parents, [[#Henry Summerhayes|Henry]] ([[Will Knightley]]) and [[#Margot Summerhayes|Margot]] ([[Jill Baker]]), who initially dislike Max. However, they eventually accept him and Emma moves from [[Clapham]] into Max's home. Whilst she is facing a disciplinary hearing, Keeble asks Emma to give hand over Lauren's laptop; something Emma refuses to do as it is breaking the police rules. However, when reminded that she could lose her job, Emma gives Keeble the laptop, but soon regrets this and later confesses to Lauren what she has done. The police find suspicious activity on Lucy's social media site, which was down to [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), but they also discover that Abi knew about Max and Lucy's affair. Despite helping Keeble, Emma loses her job.\n\nBryant tells Emma it was Max that placed the anonymous phonecall to the police about their relationship, and she angrily ends her relationship with him due to this. However, she finds an anonymous envelope addressed to her, which was posted by [[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), containing proof that Lauren was not truthful about her alibi. After viewing the clip, Emma shows it to Lauren, who tells her that she went to the Beale household because she wanted a drink and wanted to see Lucy. However, Lauren worries that Emma is just using her to spy on her family. Later that night, Max admits to Emma that her passion for her job is what made him fall in love with her, and that he only acted out of fear of losing her. She later admits to Max that she is also scared of their relationship not ending well, and both admit neither of them want it to end, so agree to try to start again from scratch. Emma spends Christmas Day with the Branning and Beale families, but ends up asking questions about Lucy, which upset the others. She then arranges drinks in [[The Queen Victoria]] pub with both families, and uses it as an opportunity to pry. [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) takes umbrage and points out that Emma is no longer a police officer and the murder investigation is no longer any of her business. However, after an argument breaks out in between Ian and [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]), Emma makes a discovery and rushes home. She finds the case notes of the murder investigation and solves the case. Emma makes a phonecall to an unknown person, telling them, \"I know you killed Lucy\". On New Year's Day 2015, Emma meets with the suspect in the park in an attempt to convince them to go to the police. Emma later texts the suspect stating that she cannot keep the secret any longer. She is then hit by a car driven by [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), that has been tampered with by [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]). Emma initially appears to be fine but she later collapses. Max takes Emma to hospital after she bleeds from the ear but she later dies from a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]].\n\nIn February 2015, shortly after Ian's wedding to Jane, he finds out that his son [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) killed Lucy and that Jane has been covering for him. Jane admits to meeting with Emma at the park on New Year's Day in an attempt to stop her going to the police. She reveals that Emma suspected she lied about her alibi about her being at [[Masood Ahmed]]'s ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) house at the time because Max had video footage showing that her car was not there. Jane states that her explanation of what happened caused Emma to hesitate on deciding whether to go to the police.\n\nThe car crash that killed Emma received a nomination at the [[Inside Soap Awards]] in 2015.<ref name=ISA15Longlist>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a658118/inside-soap-awards-2015-longlist-revealed-whos-in-line-for-best-actor-actress-and-newcomer.html#~pmHi8CWFSFhM6F Inside Soap Awards 2015 longlist revealed: Who's in line for Best Actor, Actress and Newcomer \u2013 Soap News \u2013 Digital Spy]</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Cameron Bryant ==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = EastEnders\n|name = DS Cameron Bryant\n|portrayer = [[Glen Wallace]]\n|introducer = [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]\n|classification = [[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 2016|Former; recurring]]\n|years= 2014\u20132016\n|first= Episode 4841<br />{{Start date|2014|4|21|df=y}}\n|last= Episode 5302<br />{{end date|2016|6|16|df=y}}\n|occupation= Detective Sergeant\n}}\n'''Detective Sergeant Cameron Bryant''', played by [[Glen Wallace]], is a [[sergeant#United Kingdom|police sergeant]] investigating [[Lucy Beale]]'s ([[Hetti Bywater]]) [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?|murder]].

They meet and Yvonne and Dot immediately clash, but later get on. She confirms that Charlie is her and Dot's son Nick's, son, after Dot believed that Charlie was lying to her about his identity. When Charlie and Yvonne leave, it is clear that something is suspicious, as Charlie asks whether Dot had believed what Yvonne has said. They also imply that Yvonne has been hurt by a member of Dot's family. Over the next few months, Charlie continues to see Dot and she gets used to having him around. It is revealed that Nick is alive, though Charlie and Yvonne have staged his death. Yvonne asks Charlie to stop seeing Dot, as she thinks that Nick has tracked them down. He agrees to go to Ireland with her, but later decides to move in with Dot, implying that Yvonne has left alone. Several months later, Yvonne returns again and is not very pleased when she finds out that Charlie is engaged to [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and that she is pregnant with his child. When Nick returns to Walford and demands money, so that he can leave the country, Yvonne applies for a temporary cleaning job and moves in with Dot and Charlie, to help raise the cash. Dot decides to forgive Charlie for what he has done to her, but reveals to Nick that if he does not leave the country by New Year's Day, then she will hand him into the police. Yvonne and Nick warm to each other again, partly through their hatred of Ronnie. They begin sleeping together in secret, which Dot discovers, but she does not tell Charlie, as she does not want her family to fall apart, once again.  When Ronnie suggests that Nick should be locked in his room, so that people do not discover that he is still alive, Yvonne and Dot refuse to go along with it, but Charlie persuades them to go ahead with Ronnie's plan.\n\nOn the day of Charlie and Ronnie's wedding, Nick escapes from his room and cuts the brakes of Ronnie's sister, [[Roxy Mitchell|Roxy]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) car, as revenge against Ronnie, who wants her cousin, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), to dispose of him. At Charlie and Ronnie's wedding party, Ronnie's waters break, but whilst Roxy is driving them to the hospital, they knock [[DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]), down, killing her and the car crashes, placing Ronnie in a coma. Charlie and Ronnie's baby is safely delivered and Yvonne is delighted to be a grandmother, but Ronnie is still in a critical condition. The day after the accident, Yvonne discovers what Nick has done, but he convinces her to frame Phil, by putting the oil rag in his coat pocket. Phil is arrested and charged, but after witnessing Charlie beat up Phil's son, [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), she tells Charlie the truth about the accident. When Charlie discovers that Nick cut the brakes of Roxy's car and that Yvonne helped to frame Phil, he and Dot order them both to leave. Yvonne tells Charlie how much she loves him before packing her bags and leaving Walford.\n\nYvonne returns in May 2015 to give evidence against Dot during Nick's murder trial. She attempts to illustrate Dot as an evil, manipulative old lady who wanted Nick dead for years. She also informs the jury of Nick's plot to poison Dot, and suggests that this may be one of her motives to kill him. However, Dot's defence inform the jury of Dot and Charlie throwing Yvonne out of the house after it transpired that she helped frame Phil for the car accident, and they state that Yvonne is a bitter, jealous woman who is holding a petty grudge against Dot for throwing her out. It is also commented that Yvonne stole items from the care home that she used to work at, which damages her reputation.

Elaine convinces Linda to dress up and work the bar during a musical bingo night run by her granddaughter [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]), and later becomes suspicious when she notices tension between her daughter and Dean Wicks. She accuses Linda of having an affair with him, revealing that she cheated on Linda's deceased father John before his death. Linda denies this passionately and Elaine believes her, but still sensing something is wrong, warns Dean to stay away from Linda. She returns to Walford in December and finds out that Linda was raped. Elaine then allows Mick and Linda to stay with her for a while to escape the Square. Elaine returns for an event at The Vic, and then again when Linda has her five-month scan. After the scan, she breaks down to Elaine, revealing her fears that the baby is Dean's, not Mick's. It is later but finally revealed that after Linda gives birth prematurely to baby [[Ollie Carter]], he is Mick's son.\n\nOne year after Linda's rape, Mick arranges for Elaine to take her on holiday. They return early, and Elaine brings with her new toyboy fianc\u00e9, [[Jason Adams (EastEnders)|Jason Adams]] ([[Scott Neal]]) with her. The Carters are at first cautious of Jason, particularly Linda, which frustrates Elaine. Mick and Linda hear somebody downstairs, and when they investigate, they find Jason naked with Mick's great-aunt, [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]). Mick and Linda force Babe to get Jason to leave, without Elaine knowing. However, when Elaine teases Babe as to how she has never had a man in her life, Babe claims that she had sex with Jason. Elaine does not believe her and accuses her of trying to cause trouble for her and Jason. However, later that day, Babe plays a recording on her mobile phone to Elaine, the Carters and the pub's customers of Jason persuading her to help him rob the pub, revealing their one-night stand in the process. Elaine is furious and slaps Babe for humiliating her and for cheating with her fianc\u00e9, before Mick orders Jason to leave. Linda then persuades Elaine to listen to Babe's version of events, which reveal that she did not have sex with Jason, but they came close. Elaine manages to forgive Babe, but when Jason arrives for his belongings, she, Babe and Linda are all stunned at how remorseless he is for hurting the family. Linda throws Jason out.\n\nElaine is thrilled when Linda and Mick plan to marry, but causes tension when she tries to take over the planning. Mick is able to get her involved in a nativity play, so she does not have time to plan the wedding. Once the couple marry, Elaine decides to return to Watford. She returns when Ollie is injured and may have brain damage. Linda misses a health worker's visit, so Elaine takes charge.<ref name=\"31mar16\"/>\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2016, Linda receives a phonecall from a hospital in Spain informing her that Elaine has suffered a severe stroke and it is unknown whether she will recover. Linda decides she has to leave Walford with her son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Ted Reilly]]) to be with and support her mother through her illness. After six months away caring for Elaine, Linda returns to Walford for her 40th birthday party. However, she returns to Watford the same evening. It is revealed that Elaine has recovered and that her stroke was not as severe as first made out, and that she and Linda are hiding a secret.

He is attracted to [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]), despite her coy nature, and helps with the cooking for her brother [[Tamwar Masood|Tamwar]]'s ([[Himesh Patel]]) birthday to impress her. Kush helps Martin's wife [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) to arrange a nude charity calendar, and convinces her by walking naked through the market. As they bond over the idea, Sonia attempts to kiss him, and then admits that she is having trouble in her marriage. Kush encourages her to forget about it, and later takes part in the charity calendar along with Sonia. In an attempt to give Shabnam some Christmas spirit, he kisses her, but keeps this from his friends. Kush pushes Shabnam on her feelings for him, and she later has a one-night stand with him as she is upset over losing her job. She rejects him after, feeling guilty for betraying her religious views, until Kush convinces her to start a relationship. They keep it a secret, until [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) rumbles them and they decide to tell Shabnam's family. However, Shabnam's father [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) hears it from [[#Donna Yates|Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) first, and is angry at them for keeping it a secret. Shabnam persuades Masood to accept them but ends up lying that Kush has proposed to her. When he tells her that it is happening too fast, as they have only been dating a short while, Shabnam is devastated at her actions and Masood throws him out. Afterwards, Kush confides in Martin that he is not ready for another marriage after the death of his first wife, Safirah. At Donna's 30th birthday party, he gets drunk and when Shabnam tries to talk to him, he tells her that he is still grieving over the loss of his wife. Eventually, Shabnam admits that she does not want to get married; she only lied about the proposal because she loves him. They decide to take things more slowly. Masood comes round to this, but tells them that he does not want to see Shabnam getting heartbroken. However, Kush later proposes to Shabnam after learning of her daughter from Stacey, whom he had earlier kissed.\n\nAfter kissing Stacey a second time and regretting it, Kush finds out that Shabnam is five months pregnant with their child. He has initial doubts about this, but they soon begin planning their wedding. Seven months into her pregnancy, Shabnam's baby dies, leaving Kush heartbroken. Shabnam gives birth to their son, [[Zaair Kazemi|Zaair]], but Kush is unable to cope and leaves the room. He visits Zaair later, cuddling him and telling him how proud he is. Shabnam and Kush argue because he was not there for her and she plans to move to Pakistan, while he considers returning to Essex with Carmel. However, Carmel and Masood get them to reunite. Shabnam rearranges their wedding, hoping that being married will help them gain custody of her daughter [[Jade Green (EastEnders)|Jade Green]] (Amaya Edward). Kush thinks they are marrying for the wrong reasons, but they agree that they love each other and want to marry. Before the wedding, Shabnam tells Kush that Stacey's baby is not Martin's, and Stacey tells him she thinks he could be the father. Stacey swears a reluctant Kush to secrecy and he marries Shabnam and departs with her for their honeymoon. When Kush and Shabnam return, Kush learns on the day of Jade's hearing that Shabnam took Jade without permission. Kush and Shabnam decide not to go for custody of Jade when they realise they have not come to terms with Zaair's death.\n\nWhen Stacey's son [[Arthur Fowler (2015 character)|Arthur Fowler]] is born, Shabnam thinks Kush could be the father from his behaviour, and confronts Stacey, worried she will lose her husband, but Stacey tells her he is not the father, so Shabnam finds Kush and passionately kisses him. However, Shabnam later hears Kush talking to Carmel about Arthur being his son, and Shabnam begins to re-evaluate her marriage. She wants to tell Martin the truth about Arthur's paternity, but when Stacey's mental condition worsens, she and Kush agree to wait and Kush vows to prioritise Shabnam over Arthur. Kush suggests to Shabnam that they move away, but she decides to leave on her own, urging Kush to stay for Arthur. Masood finds out about this and Arthur's paternity, so punches Kush and threatens to kill him if he comes near Shabnam again, and tells him that Shabnam has already decided to leave Walford. Kush then breaks down in Carmel's arms, thinking he has lost Shabnam for good. Despite Kush's pleas, Shabnam leaves Walford with Jade after planting a tree in Zaair's memory, telling Kush that they must lead separate lives, but she still loves him. Kush then starts drinking heavily and Martin finds out that Kush is Arthur's father. Stacey tells Kush that he can be a part of Arthur's life, but Martin disagrees and breaks his friendship with Kush. An emotional Kush has sex with [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]), but she suffers an epileptic fit in his bed. Kush calls Nancy's former boyfriend, Tamwar, who calls Kush selfish. Kush realises he is a bad role model so tells Stacey and Martin that he wants nothing to do with Arthur. Tamwar calls Carmel, who agrees to move in with Kush. Carmel then reveals to Kush that his father has sold their house and she is homeless.\n\nKush develops feelings for Carmel's best friend [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). They admit their feelings to each other and they have a brief fling, however, she ends it, fearing it will ruin her friendship with Carmel. Kush later discovers from Carmel that Denise is pregnant and believes he is the father, but Denise tells him he is not as she is 18 to 19 weeks pregnant. Kush later advises his younger brother [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) when he wants to have sex with his girlfriend, [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]), who is Martin's daughter. When the explicit image Shakil sent to Bex goes viral around Shakil's school, Bex is blamed, even though [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) was the one who sent it. This causes things to become fraught yet again between the Kazemis and the Fowlers.\n\nKush pursues Denise again but she turns him down due to her friendship with Carmel. However, when Kush is in the fish and chip shop after having a drink with Denise, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) crashes into it, leaving him unconscious. Denise helps rescue Kush, and while he is in hospital, she admits her feelings for him and they start a relationship. Back home, Carmel interrupts Kush and Denise one morning, but assumes that Kush has met a doctor from the hospital, which he confirms. Denise tells Kush that they should admit to their relationship from the start, so they tell Carmel, who is shocked, and says that when the relationship ends, she would be forced to take Kush's side and would lose her friend forever. Kush asks Denise to move in with him but she declines where Kush accuses her of comparing him to her controlling ex-husband, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]). Kush storms off and goes into cardiac arrest in the middle of the market, and is diagnosed with [[Brugada Syndrome]]. Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Later, Kush's other brother, [[Darius Kazemi (EastEnders)|Darius Kazemi]] (Ash Rizi), offers him work in [[Dubai]] but Kush and Carmel are left devastated when Shakil, while returning a stolen bike taken by his friend, dies after being stabbed by a gang.\n\nWhen Kush and Denise end their relationship, he begins having a secret sexual relationship with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]). The pair decide to keep it a secret due to the complicated relationship Kush has with the Slaters and Fowlers, but when they are caught having sex, they admit to being together. When Kush sees [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) being harassed on a balcony by [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tom Wells), he rushes to her defence, and accidentally pushes Leo over the balcony. \n\n===Reception===\nGhadami was nominated for Best Newcomer at the [[British Soap Awards]] in 2015 for his portrayal as Kush,<ref name=BSA15longlist>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a644158/eastenders-tops-british-soap-awards-2015-shortlist.html#~pmHjqnxY6Eyupb EastEnders tops British Soap Awards 2015 shortlist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but lost out to ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''{{'}} Jessica Regan, who plays [[Niamh Donoghue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/a647772/who-won-at-british-soap-awards-2015-see-the-winners-list-in-full/|title=Who won at British Soap Awards 2015?

On a day release, he stays overnight in Shirley's caravan, but is unknowingly kidnapped when Mick and Dean tow the caravan away, believing Shirley to be inside. In [[Walford]], after talking with Buster about his longtime association with the Carters, Dean works it out that Buster is his father. They bond and plan with Shirley to escape together. Mick alerts the authorities and Buster is arrested for not reporting back after his day release and is given a month's extra prison sentence. Buster then realises that Mick is his son as well. Buster later returns to Walford on with Dean<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pwlv5 BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 03/04/2015<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and explains that Dean visited him in prison and that after he got released, he booked a one-way ticket to Greece for him, Shirley and Dean to start a new life together. Later, when Dean decides to visit his grandfather, [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]), at the hospital, Buster takes him there, while Shirley packs at home. When the police arrive at the hospital and arrest Dean for breaking bail conditions (following his arrest for raping Linda), Buster thinks that Mick called them, and confronts him and his fianc\u00e9e [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) the next day. When they explain that they did not call the police, Buster works out that it was, in fact, Shirley who called the police, and confronts her at home. Furious, he goes to the train station to leave for Greece alone, where Mick and Linda's children, [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) and [[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), follow him and explain that they need to be there for Stan. Later that night, Buster unexpectedly shows up at Shirley's flat, having had a change of heart and deciding to be there for Dean. He subsequently visits and supports Dean throughout his time in prison, informing him when Stan dies and helps keep Dean's salon, Blades, afloat with Shirley.  After Dean is released without charge, Shirley's aunt [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) organises a party for him in Blades, during which a man throws a brick through the window. Buster discovers that Babe paid the man, so he visits Babe at the Carters' pub, [[The Queen Victoria]], and pours her trifle over her head. When Mick's son [[Ollie Carter]] is born, Buster begins to bond with Mick when he helps him build a cot. Buster discovers that he has another grandchild from Dean and [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). Upon discovering that she suffers from [[cystic fibrosis]], Dean breaks down in Buster's arms. After Dean attacks his fianc\u00e9e [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Buster realises he is a rapist and disowns him. He later visits him in prison where he and Shirley warn him not to contact them and Buster says that he has friends in prison that could make Dean's life hell. When [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) decides to sell his restaurant to a supermarket chain, Buster leads a campaign to stop from him selling, during which he and Ian's mother, [[Kathy Sullivan (EastEnders)|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), become attracted to each other. Buster later propositions Kathy for a secret relationship as he believes he is with the wrong woman and begins secretly meeting her without telling Shirley. When he sees Kathy's estranged husband [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) take Kathy in his car, he tells Gavin's daughter [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), and fearing for Kathy's safety, they go to Gavin's address. When they get there, a woman falls from the balcony onto the car and lies dead on the ground, and Buster thinks it is Kathy. However, it is Gavin's sister [[Margaret Midhurst]] ([[Jan Harvey]]), and Buster finds Kathy hiding in one of the rooms and helps her escape Gavin's house. Later, Kathy tells Buster she needs to end their relationship because she feels things between them are getting too serious. However, they passionately kiss and are seen by Kathy's former husband [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). They start to see each other secretly and eventually sleep together. However, when Kathy's son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) is attacked in a homophobic attack, she ends the affair, leaving Buster heartbroken. Lee realises Buster is cheating on Shirley and tells Mick, who confronts Buster, but Buster does not reveal Kathy's identity. Mick urges Buster to confess to Shirley or he will have nothing to do with him any more. Realising that he no longer loves Shirley, Buster opts for the latter and decides to leave Walford with Kathy. However she leaves Buster heartbroken again when she chooses to remain with her family, so Buster leaves alone.<ref name=\"23sep16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 23/09/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ws5xg |series=EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Jennie Darnell; Writer: Wendy Granditer |station=[[BBC]] |network=[[BBC One]] |airdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sylvie Carter==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=EastEnders\n|name=Sylvie Carter\n|portrayer=[[Linda Marlowe]]\n|introducer=[[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]\n|classification=[[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 2017|Former; regular]]\n|years= 2014\u20132017\n|first=Episode 4974 <br> 11 December 2014\n|last= Episode 5467 <br> 30 March 2017\n|family=[[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carter]]\n|mother=Edna Smith\n|sisters=[[Babe Smith]]\n|husband=[[Stan Carter]] (until 2015)\n|daughters=[[Shirley Carter]]<br />[[Tina Carter]]\n|grandsons=[[Mick Carter]]<br>[[Dean Wicks]]\n|relatives=[[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]]<br />[[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]]<br>[[Nancy Carter]]<br />[[Ollie Carter]]}}\n\n'''Sylvie Carter''', portrayed by [[Linda Marlowe]], is the estranged wife of already established character, [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) and is the mother of [[Shirley Carter|Shirley]] ([[Linda Henry]]), [[Tina Carter|Tina]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) and was also thought to be the mother of her grandson, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), until May 2014.

In December 2014, Shirley and Mick visit their aunt, Sylvie's sister, [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]), and discover that she has been living with her, since her diagnosis of [[Alzheimer's disease]], five years previously. Although she is still hostile towards Shirley, she takes a shine to Mick and when he cannot get hold of Babe, he and Shirley take Sylvie back to their home in Walford. Babe is angry to discover this, especially when she goes missing and when Sylvie is found, Babe takes her home. On Christmas Eve, Mick, Shirley and Babe take Sylvie out for lunch, to which Mick gets her a present, but Sylvie remains hostile to Shirley. At the end of the meal, Sylvie tells Mick that she wants to spend Christmas with him and his family and Babe brings her to their pub, [[The Queen Victoria]], the following day, upsetting Stan. When Stan learns the truth about Mick's parentage, as he is Shirley's biological son, he blames Babe, who then abandons Sylvie and she moves in with them. Later, Stan attempts to talk to Sylvie, but she ignores him and this causes him to snap at her. When Babe eventually decides to take Sylvie home, she informs Stan that he did make her happy, before leaving, returning briefly for a dance party at the local community centre, where she kisses Stan. Babe is angry that Sylvie has left home, without her permission and also reveals that she had a crush on Stan, before him and Sylvie became a couple. When Babe announces that she is struggling to take care of Sylvie and that she is going to put her into a care home, they arrange a leaving party for her and her and Stan reminisce, about how they used to love each other. When Shirley sits down and explains to Mick why she could not be a mother to him, revealing that it was Sylvie and Babe's fault, as they tried to cause her to miscarry, by pushing her down the stairs, and would not even let her hold him, when she had just given birth to him, he disowns them.\n\nIn April 2015, Babe takes Sylvie to see Stan, who is [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], in a hospice, in the hope of causing trouble between him and his new fianc\u00e9e, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]). However, Stan and Sylvie admit to each other that they made the right decision to separate and take off each other's wedding rings, before saying an emotional goodbye. Sylvie later appears when Babe returns from Stan's funeral and reveals to Sylvie that Stan has died. It transpires that Babe did not tell Sylvie about Stan's death straight away, because she wanted to attend his funeral without her. When Sylvie tries to visit the rest of the Carter family to comfort them, Babe becomes hostile and orders her to stay put. When Sylvie exclaims that no man would ever love her, Babe slaps her and she then pretends to be upset and holds her cheek in pain, leading to Babe hugging her, only for Sylvie to bite her neck as revenge for slapping her. Sylvie then tries to call the police on Babe, as she and [[Queenie Trott]] ([[Judy Cornwell]]), broke the law when they lived in Ramsgate. Babe then manipulates Sylvie into not going through with it.\n\nTina brings Sylvie to Mick and Linda's wedding, though Shirley is angry about this. When asked, Sylvie does not remember why she is there and after being told, she then mistakes Mick's eldest son [[#Lee Carter|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) for Mick. In June, Sylvie is escorted to The Queen Vic by the police because she was found and would only say the name of the pub.<ref name=\"14jun16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 14/06/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07gvn6f |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: David Tucker; Writer: Katie Douglas |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 14 June 2016}}</ref> Sylvie's social worker visits and reveals that Sylvie has made unwanted sexual advances to other residents at her care home, though the home would welcome her back. The Carters decide the home is not good enough and try to find a new one, but Sylvie is not considered a priority case, so they are forced to look after her. Linda becomes worried for the safety of her infant son [[Ollie Carter]] when Sylvie calls him a [[slug]] and threatens to pour salt on him, so Tina allows Sylvie to move in with her and her girlfriend [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), which Sonia finds difficult adapting to. After Babe is locked in the freezer at The Queen Vic, Sylvie makes a trifle and attempts to replace Babe's status in the family. Babe's memory from the attack eventually returns, and tells Mick and Linda that it was Sylvie who locked her in the freezer. After Sylvie seemingly confesses to attacking Babe and arguing with Shirley, it is revealed that [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) was the real culprit, with Babe framing Sylvie in an attempt to have her sent back to a care home. Eventually, Sonia breaks up with Tina and moves to [[Kettering]], so Tina and Sylvie move out of the house and in with Shirley, after her relationship with [[#Buster Briggs|Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]) ends.\n\nBabe looks after Sylvie, who insults Babe, so Babe convinces her they are meeting Stan and takes her in the rain to a canal, leaving her there. Sylvie is later found and brought back home, where she is scared of Babe. Babe denies any involvement but eventually rants that she is more family than Sylvie and rants at Sylvie, saying she should have drowned.
