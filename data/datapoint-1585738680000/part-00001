It is essential to traditional navigation, and must be filled in at least daily.\n\nThe term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the [[chip log]] that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water. Today's ship's log has grown to contain many other types of information, and is a record of operational data relating to a [[ship]] or [[submarine]], such as weather conditions, times of routine events and significant incidents, [[crew]] complement or what [[port]]s were docked at and when.\n\nThe term ''logbook'' has spread to a wide variety of other usages. Today, a virtual or [[electronic logbook]] is typically used for record-keeping for complex machines such as nuclear plants or particle accelerators. In military terms, a logbook is a series of official and legally binding documents. Each document (usually arranged by date) is marked with the time of an event or action of significance.\n\n==Shipping==\nMost national shipping authorities and admiralties specify that logbooks are kept to provide a record of events, and to help crews navigate should [[radio]], [[radar]] or the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] fail. Examination of the detail in a ship's log is often an important part of the investigative process for official maritime inquiries, in much the same way as a \"[[Flight recorder#Flight data recorder|black box]]\" is used on [[airplane]]s. Logbook entries are sometimes of great importance in legal cases involving maritime commercial disputes.\n\nCommercial ships and naval vessels often keep a \"rough log\", \u2013 or \"scrap log\" \u2013 a preliminary draft of the ship's course, speed, location, and other data, which is then transcribed as the \"smooth log\", \u2013 or \"official log\" \u2013 the final version of the ship's record. Changes may be made to the rough log but the smooth log is considered permanent and no erasures are permitted. Alterations or corrections in an official logbook must be initialled by the authorised keeper of the logbook and the original data entries which have been cancelled or corrected must remain legible.\n\n==Other logbooks==\nThe [[Vehicle registration certificate|V5C]] [[motor vehicle registration]] document in the [[United Kingdom]] is often referred to as the \"logbook\".\n\nIn the [[fishing industry]], a logbook is used to record catch data as part of the [[fisheries management|fisheries regulations]]. It is then submitted to the fishing authorities of the vessel's flag state.\n\nFor [[amateur radio]], the logbook is where the hams register their contacts and other radio operations. There are several programs to help radio operators in the management of their logbook.\n\n[[Aircraft pilot]]s must maintain a [[pilot logbook]] to record their time spent flying and in a simulator.\n\nIn [[New Zealand]], a logbook is used to register [[work-time|driver and operator work time]] for commercial heavy vehicles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/heavy-vehicle-work-time-requirements-and-logbooks/|title=Heavy vehicle work time requirements and logbooks|website=DT Driver Training|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diver-logbook.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Two different logbooks for scuba divers.]]\nIn [[scuba diving]], the [[Dive log|logbook]] documents the experience of a diver by logging a diver's dives.\n\nIn [[Parachuting|skydiving]], a logbook serves as a parachutist's personal history in the sport and also serves as an identifying document.
