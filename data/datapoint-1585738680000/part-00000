It was declared a town in 2004, along with seven other localities in Suceava County. The town administers seven villages: Budeni, Gulia, Poiana, Poienari, Probota, Sili\u0219tea Nou\u0103 and Valea Poienei.\n\nDespite being a town, Dolhasca looks like a rural settlement in many aspects, and the main occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture. The Probota Monastery, built in 1530 by Moldavian ruler [[Petru Rare\u0219]], is close to the town. Among Dolhasca's notable natives are comedian [[Alexandru Ar\u0219inel]] and neurosurgeon Constantin N.
