On the [[Parthenon Frieze|frieze of the Parthenon]], [[Zeus]] occupies a square seat with a bar-back and thick turned legs; it is ornamented with winged [[sphinx]]es and the feet of beasts. The characteristic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] chairs were of [[marble]], also adorned with sphinxes.  The [[curule chair]] was originally very similar in form to the modern folding chair, but eventually received a good deal of ornament.\nThe most famous of the very few chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed [[Chair of Saint Peter]] in [[St Peter's Basilica]] at [[Rome]]. The wooden portions are much decayed, but it would appear to be [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient [[sedia gestatoria]]. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, [[Gregorovius]] says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions\u2019 heads and winged figures of Victory (or [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival of the end of the 18th century.\n\n==Mexican chairs==\nOne type of chair in ancient Mexico is called the [[icpalli]] and is mentioned by [[Jacques Soustelle]]. {{cite book |title=The Daily Life of the Aztecs|page=122}} The icpalli can be seen in Diego Rivera's mural of the [[Aztec]] market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], Palacio Nacional, [[Mexico City]].

The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early [[Merovingian]] times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.\n\nTo the same generic type belongs the famous abbots\u2019 chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily be taken to pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time acquired arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, as well as the most, ancient, English chair is that made at the end of the 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded gesso which long since disappeared.\n\nPassing from these historic examples we find the chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood at the head of the lord's table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] than in [[England]], is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy.

The furniture makers also covered their crude work with gold which is called gilding.\n\n==Chinese chairs==\n[[File:Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels, Detail 6.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Gentry (China)|Chinese gentleman]] sitting in a chair while listening to music and watching a dancer, close-up detail in a 12th-century [[Song Dynasty]] remake of the 10th-century original ''[[Gu Hongzhong|Night Revels of Han Xizai]]''.]]\n[[File:Fauteuil racine Chine Quianlong musee arts asiatiques Nice.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Chinese armchair made from roots.

Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use.  We find almost at once began to reflect the fashions of the hour. No piece of furniture has ever been so close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size, shape and sturdiness with the fashion not only of women's dress but of men's also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a \u201cconversation chair\u201d was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common.\n\nThe majority of the chairs of all countries until the middle of the 17th century were of timber (the commonest survival is [[oak]])<ref>Knell, David (2000), ''English Country Furniture: The Vernacular Tradition 1500-1900'', ACC, 44. {{ISBN|1-85149-302-6}}.</ref> without upholstery, and when it became customary to cushion them, [[leather]] was sometimes employed; subsequently [[velvet]] and [[silk]] were extensively used, and at a later period cheaper and often more durable materials. <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:ABosseHearing.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving by Abraham Bosse, Paris ''ca'' 1630]] -->.  In Abraham Bosse's engraving (''illustration, left''), a stylish Parisian musical party of about 1630 have pulled their low chairs (called \"[[backstool]]s\" in contemporary England) away from the tapestry-hung walls where they were normally lined up. The padded back panels were covered with needlework panels to suit the tapestries, or in other settings with leather, plain or tooled. Plain cloth across the back hid the wooden framing. Stools with column legs complement the set, but aren't ''en suite''.  In seventeenth century [[France]] the [[berg\u00e8re]] chair became fashionable among the nobility and was often made of [[walnut]].\n\nLeather was not infrequently used even for the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form\u2014occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver\u2014which [[Venice]] sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather is one of the most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.\n\n==English chairs==\n[[File:English Side Chair.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An English side chair (c. 1850) of unknown maker. The chair is made of [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] with inlaid [[mother of pearl]], gilded and painted decoration. Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nAlthough English furniture derives so extensively from foreign and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case down to the end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped [[splat (furniture)|splat]] and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. [[George Hepplewhite]], [[Thomas Sheraton]] and [[Robert Adam]] all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of [[Thomas Chippendale]], remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.\n\n18th-century chairs\n[[File:FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A reading of [[Moli\u00e8re]]'', [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Troy]], about 1728]]\nInformal, ''galante'' manners and a new half-reclining posture that replaced the former bolt-upright demeanor of court and aristocracy in the age of Louis XIV went hand-in-hand with new commodious seat furniture, developed in Paris about 1720 (''illustration, right''). The new [[Rococo]] chairs were upholstered ''\u00e0 chassis'', on removable frames secured by clips, so that changes from winter to summer furniture could be effected without recourse to the ''menuisier''.  Off-season upholstered frames were stored in the ''garde-meuble''. These early Louis XV chairs have backs upholstered '''''\u00e0 la reine''''', with the back in a flat panel that was ordinarily placed squared to the wall, so that the top-rails' curves complemented those of the ''boiserie'' panels behind them.\n\nIn the illustration, the symmetrical cusped and scrolling seatrails that flow into stubby '''[[cabriole leg]]s''' of these comfortable low armchairs (''chauffeuses'') have their direct origins in Chinese lacquer tables (not chairs).\n\n[[File:19th century American Armchair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|American Armchair (1850-1863) made of Rosewood, rosewood veneer, pine, and chestnut. Attributed to [[John Henry Belter]]. Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nFrench fashions in chairs, as with everything else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable \"Louis XV\" French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which interfered with the unified flow of curved seatrails into '''cabriole legs''' that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict [[guild]] regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was the business of the ''menuisier'' alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (''huissier''), both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable ''[[berg\u00e8re]]'' (\"shepherdess\") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes ''rechampi en blanc'') or left in the natural color (''\u00e1 la capuchine''), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded ''boiseries'' for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Li\u00e8ge all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SothebysChairs1a.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]] -->\n\n[[File:ChairPhoto1369.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]]\nIn the late 1760s in Paris the first Parisian [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] chairs were made, even before the accession of [[Louis XVI]], whose name is attached to the first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sen\u00e9 and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.\n\nThe 18th century was indeed the golden age of the chair, especially in France and England (including [[Colonial America]]), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] could not refrain from writing of them in his [[Encyclop\u00e9die]]. The typical [[Louis XVI style|Louis Seize style]] chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] or [[Watteau]]-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.\n\nThough some stories attribute its invention to [[Benjamin Franklin]], historians trace the [[rocking chair]]'s origins to North America during the early 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century.\n\n==19th-century chairs==\nThe [[art nouveau]] school produced chairs of simplicity. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] produced heavy, straight lined, minimally ornamented chairs. One of the most famous of those chairs is the [[Michael Thonet]] Bendwood chair or the bistro chair, created in 1859. It has revolutionized the industry and is still being produced today.\n\n==20th-century and modern chairs==\nThe 20th century saw an increasing use of iPads in chair construction with such things as all-metal [[folding chairs]], metal-legged chairs, the [[Streit Slumber Chair|Slumber Chair]], moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs, recliner chairs (easy chair), [[butterfly chair]], [[beanbag chairs]], the egg or [[pod chair]], plywood and laminate wood chairs, and [[massage chair]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facilitysolutionsplus.com/blog/2019/3/13/ergonomic-chairs-how-to-choose-the-best-chair-for-you |title=Ergonomic Chairs |accessdate=2019-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fujiiryoki.com/eng/history/|title=History of Massage Chairs|website=www.fujiiryoki.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> Architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] also designed chairs to match the design of their buildings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Belanger|first1=Christian|title=New Exhibit Gives American Chair Design Its Due Respect|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/arts-culture/February-2018/Catherine-Shotick/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Berg\u00e8re]]\n*[[Watchman's chair]]\n*[[Windsor chair]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Chair |volume=5 |pages=801\u2013802}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentchair.com/product/raani-chair/ Rani Chair] - Galleries of ancient chairs\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Witold Rybczynski |title=Now I Sit Me Down: From Klismos to Plastic Chair: A Natural History |year=2017 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374537036}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Chair}}\n[[Category:Chairs|*]]\n[[Category:Cultural history|Chair]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Chair]]s are known from [[Ancient Egypt]] and have been widespread in the Western world from the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] onwards.

Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a \u201cconversation chair\u201d was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common.\n\nThe majority of the chairs of all countries until the middle of the 17th century were of timber (the commonest survival is [[oak]])<ref>Knell, David (2000), ''English Country Furniture: The Vernacular Tradition 1500-1900'', ACC, 44. {{ISBN|1-85149-302-6}}.</ref> without upholstery, and when it became customary to cushion them, [[leather]] was sometimes employed; subsequently [[velvet]] and [[silk]] were extensively used, and at a later period cheaper and often more durable materials. <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:ABosseHearing.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving by Abraham Bosse, Paris ''ca'' 1630]] -->.  In Abraham Bosse's engraving (''illustration, left''), a stylish Parisian musical party of about 1630 have pulled their low chairs (called \"[[backstool]]s\" in contemporary England) away from the tapestry-hung walls where they were normally lined up. The padded back panels were covered with needlework panels to suit the tapestries, or in other settings with leather, plain or tooled. Plain cloth across the back hid the wooden framing. Stools with column legs complement the set, but aren't ''en suite''.  In seventeenth century [[France]] the [[berg\u00e8re]] chair became fashionable among the nobility and was often made of [[walnut]].\n\nLeather was not infrequently used even for the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form\u2014occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver\u2014which [[Venice]] sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather is one of the most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.\n\n==English chairs==\n[[File:English Side Chair.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An English side chair (c. 1850) of unknown maker. The chair is made of [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] with inlaid [[mother of pearl]], gilded and painted decoration. Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nAlthough English furniture derives so extensively from foreign and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case down to the end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped [[splat (furniture)|splat]] and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. [[George Hepplewhite]], [[Thomas Sheraton]] and [[Robert Adam]] all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of [[Thomas Chippendale]], remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.\n\n18th-century chairs\n[[File:FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A reading of [[Moli\u00e8re]]'', [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Troy]], about 1728]]\nInformal, ''galante'' manners and a new half-reclining posture that replaced the former bolt-upright demeanor of court and aristocracy in the age of Louis XIV went hand-in-hand with new commodious seat furniture, developed in Paris about 1720 (''illustration, right''). The new [[Rococo]] chairs were upholstered ''\u00e0 chassis'', on removable frames secured by clips, so that changes from winter to summer furniture could be effected without recourse to the ''menuisier''.  Off-season upholstered frames were stored in the ''garde-meuble''. These early Louis XV chairs have backs upholstered '''''\u00e0 la reine''''', with the back in a flat panel that was ordinarily placed squared to the wall, so that the top-rails' curves complemented those of the ''boiserie'' panels behind them.\n\nIn the illustration, the symmetrical cusped and scrolling seatrails that flow into stubby '''[[cabriole leg]]s''' of these comfortable low armchairs (''chauffeuses'') have their direct origins in Chinese lacquer tables (not chairs).\n\n[[File:19th century American Armchair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|American Armchair (1850-1863) made of Rosewood, rosewood veneer, pine, and chestnut. Attributed to [[John Henry Belter]]. Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nFrench fashions in chairs, as with everything else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable \"Louis XV\" French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which interfered with the unified flow of curved seatrails into '''cabriole legs''' that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict [[guild]] regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was the business of the ''menuisier'' alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (''huissier''), both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable ''[[berg\u00e8re]]'' (\"shepherdess\") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes ''rechampi en blanc'') or left in the natural color (''\u00e1 la capuchine''), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded ''boiseries'' for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Li\u00e8ge all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SothebysChairs1a.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]] -->\n\n[[File:ChairPhoto1369.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]]\nIn the late 1760s in Paris the first Parisian [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] chairs were made, even before the accession of [[Louis XVI]], whose name is attached to the first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sen\u00e9 and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.\n\nThe 18th century was indeed the golden age of the chair, especially in France and England (including [[Colonial America]]), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] could not refrain from writing of them in his [[Encyclop\u00e9die]]. The typical [[Louis XVI style|Louis Seize style]] chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] or [[Watteau]]-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.\n\nThough some stories attribute its invention to [[Benjamin Franklin]], historians trace the [[rocking chair]]'s origins to North America during the early 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century.\n\n==19th-century chairs==\nThe [[art nouveau]] school produced chairs of simplicity. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] produced heavy, straight lined, minimally ornamented chairs. One of the most famous of those chairs is the [[Michael Thonet]] Bendwood chair or the bistro chair, created in 1859. It has revolutionized the industry and is still being produced today.\n\n==20th-century and modern chairs==\nThe 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal [[folding chairs]], metal-legged chairs, the [[Streit Slumber Chair|Slumber Chair]], moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs, recliner chairs (easy chair), [[butterfly chair]], [[beanbag chairs]], the egg or [[pod chair]], plywood and laminate wood chairs, and [[massage chair]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facilitysolutionsplus.com/blog/2019/3/13/ergonomic-chairs-how-to-choose-the-best-chair-for-you |title=Ergonomic Chairs |accessdate=2019-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fujiiryoki.com/eng/history/|title=History of Massage Chairs|website=www.fujiiryoki.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> Architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] also designed chairs to match the design of their buildings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Belanger|first1=Christian|title=New Exhibit Gives American Chair Design Its Due Respect|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/arts-culture/February-2018/Catherine-Shotick/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Berg\u00e8re]]\n*[[Watchman's chair]]\n*[[Windsor chair]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Chair |volume=5 |pages=801\u2013802}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentchair.com/product/raani-chair/ Rani Chair] - Galleries of ancient chairs\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Witold Rybczynski |title=Now I Sit Me Down: From Klismos to Plastic Chair: A Natural History |year=2017 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374537036}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Chair}}\n[[Category:Chairs|*]]\n[[Category:Cultural history|Chair]]\n", "name_user": "TheKidFromNextDoor", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e20th-century and modern chairs)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_chair"}
