SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine the higher the website ranks in the [[Search_engine_results_page|search engine results page (SERP)]]. These visitors can then be converted into customers.<ref>Ortiz-Cordova, A. and Jansen, B. J.

The former instead is more focused on national or international searches.\n\n== History ==\n[[Webmaster]]s and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early [[World Wide Web|Web]]. Initially, all webmasters only needed to submit the address of a page, or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], to the various engines which would send a \"[[Web crawler|spider]]\" to \"crawl\" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be [[Index (search engine)|indexed]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thinkpink.com/bp/Thesis/Thesis.pdf| title=Finding What People Want: Experiences with the WebCrawler|accessdate=May 7, 2007| publisher=The Second International WWW Conference Chicago, USA, October 17\u201320, 1994|author=Brian Pinkerton}}</ref> The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an [[search engine indexing|indexer]], extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.\n\nWebsite owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2048891/intro-search-engine-optimization|title=Intro to Search Engine Optimization {{!}} Search Engine Watch|website=searchenginewatch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref> creating an opportunity for both [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] and [[black hat hacking|black hat]] SEO practitioners.

Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm|title=Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia|author=Cory Doctorow|date=August 26, 2001|publisher=e-LearningGuru|accessdate=May 8, 2007 |archiveurl = http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm |archivedate = April 9, 2007|author-link=Cory Doctorow}}</ref>{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tilde/InterNet/Search/1998_WWW7.html|title=What is a tall poppy among web pages?|date=April 1998|publisher=Proc. 7th Int.

Early search engines, such as [[Altavista]] and [[Infoseek]], adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings.<ref name=\"infoseeknyt\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DF123BF932A25752C1A960958260|title=Desperately Seeking Surfers|date=November 11, 1996|newspaper=New York Times|author=Laurie J. Flynn|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy relying so much on factors such as [[keyword density]] which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their [[Search engine results page|results page]]s showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/01/20/is-keyword-density-still-important-for-seo/2/#2ef69ba36733 |title=Is Keyword Density Still Important for SEO|author=Jason Demers|date=January 20, 2016|magazine=Forbes|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate. In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb (Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web), was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with search engine optimization and related topics.<ref name=\"airweb\">{{cite web|url=http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/|title=AIRWeb|publisher=Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web, annual conference|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCompanies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results.

Google ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/10/updating-user-agent-of-googlebot.html|title=Updating the user agent of Googlebot|website=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Preventing crawling ===\n{{main article|Robots Exclusion Standard}}\nTo avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard [[robots.txt]] file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a [[meta tag]] specific to robots (usually <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the [[root directory]] is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/newspapers-amok-new-york-times-spamming-google-la-times-hijacking-carscom-11169|title=Newspapers Amok!

[[Methods of website linking|Cross linking]] between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility.<ref name=\"Shari\">{{cite web |url=http://www.clickz.com/3623372 |title=The Most Important SEO Strategy | publisher = ClickZ | work = clickz.com |accessdate=April 18, 2010 }}</ref>\nWriting content that includes frequently searched keyword phrase, so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic.<ref name=\"Shari\" /> Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's metadata, including the [[HEAD tag|title tag and meta description]], will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. [[URL canonicalization]] of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the [[canonical link element]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2009/02/12/partnering-to-help-solve-duplicate-content-issues|title=Bing \u2013 Partnering to help solve duplicate content issues \u2013 Webmaster Blog \u2013 Bing Community|publisher=www.bing.com|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}</ref> or via [[301 redirect]]s can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page's link popularity score. <!--add ref here to Rhea Drysdale article on PageRank and Playdoh-->\n\n=== White hat versus black hat techniques ===\nSEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design (\"white hat\"), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (\"black hat\"). The search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them [[spamdexing]]. Industry commentators have classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] SEO, or [[black hat hacking|black hat]] SEO.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Goodman|publisher=SearchEngineWatch|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|title=Search Engine Showdown: Black hats vs. White hats at SES|accessdate=May 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222004138/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|archivedate=February 22, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jill Whalen|url=http://www.searchengineguide.com/whalen/2004/1116_jw1.html|title=Black Hat/White Hat Search Engine Optimization|publisher=searchengineguide.com|accessdate=May 9, 2007|date=November 16, 2004|author-link=Jill Whalen}}</ref>\n\nAn SEO technique is considered white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines<ref name=\"g-wmguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html|title=Google's Guidelines on Site Design|accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"ms-wmguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a|title=Bing Webmaster Guidelines |publisher = bing.com | accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/seo.html|title=What's an SEO? Does Google recommend working with companies that offer to make my site Google-friendly? | accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref> are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online \"spider\" algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility,<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hagans|publisher=[[A List Apart]]|url=http://alistapart.com/articles/accessibilityseo|title=High Accessibility Is Effective Search Engine Optimization|date = November 8, 2005 | accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref> although the two are not identical.\n\n[[spamdexing|Black hat SEO]] attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible [[Span and div|div]], or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as [[cloaking]]. Another category sometimes used is [[Grey hat|grey hat SEO]]. This is in between black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.\n\nSearch engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms, or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both [[BMW]] Germany and [[Ricoh]] Germany for use of deceptive practices.<ref name=\"intwebspam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/ramping-up-on-international-webspam/|publisher=mattcutts.com/blog | title=Ramping up on international webspam|author=Matt Cutts|date=February 4, 2006|accessdate=May 9, 2007|author-link=Matt Cutts }}</ref> Both companies, however, quickly apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's search engine results page.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 9, 2007|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/recent-reinclusions/|publisher = mattcutts.com/blog | title=Recent reinclusions|author=Matt Cutts|date=February 7, 2006|author-link=Matt Cutts}}</ref>\n\n== As marketing strategy ==\nSEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be more effective, such as paid advertising through pay per click [[Pay per click|(PPC)]] campaigns, depending on the site operator's goals.

To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their [[Search engine results page|results page]]s showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters.

The 2013 [[Google Hummingbird]] update featured an algorithm change designed to improve Google's natural language processing and semantic understanding of web pages.

Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a [[meta tag]] specific to robots (usually <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the [[root directory]] is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/newspapers-amok-new-york-times-spamming-google-la-times-hijacking-carscom-11169|title=Newspapers Amok!

White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online \"spider\" algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility,<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hagans|publisher=[[A List Apart]]|url=http://alistapart.com/articles/accessibilityseo|title=High Accessibility Is Effective Search Engine Optimization|date = November 8, 2005 | accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref> although the two are not identical.\n\n[[spamdexing|Black hat SEO]] attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible [[Span and div|div]], or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as [[cloaking]]. Another category sometimes used is [[Grey hat|grey hat SEO]]. This is in between black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.\n\nSearch engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms, or by a manual site review.
