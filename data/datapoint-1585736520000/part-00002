He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique. Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, however,<ref>Hockney on Art \u2013 Paul Joyce {{ISBN|1-4087-0157-X}}</ref> he returned to painting.\n\n===Other technology===\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the [[Quantel Paintbox]], a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen.

He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique. Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, however,<ref>Hockney on Art \u2013 Paul Joyce {{ISBN|1-4087-0157-X}}</ref> he returned to painting.\n\n===Other technology===\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the [[Quantel Paintbox]], a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen.
