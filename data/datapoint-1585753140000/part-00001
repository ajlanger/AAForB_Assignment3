I've got no reputation. I have no money. I've got nothing\" to Tony Messenger of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.<ref name=\":14\" /> These difficulties were eventually rectified when he joined Schultz Surveying and Engineering Inc. He has since continued to have a career in content marketing and crisis management.<ref name=\":16\" /> He has also become the author of several books on biblical teachings and how to recover from personal crisis.<ref name=\"SBJ Names Jetton\" /><ref name=\"The Arena\" />\n\nJetton attributed his failings to alcoholism, disconnection from his faith, and a lack of balance in his life. He has said that his time in the House of Representatives was a hectic self-indulgent period, that increasingly led him to a lifestyle standing in opposition to his personal beliefs. The restoration of personal Christian values and a more balanced lifestyle are reoccurring themes in his writing.

The company's owners, attributed much of the company's success to Jetton's aggressive marketing efforts, especially the customer database he created, the revisions he made to the company's website, and the contact plan that he helped to develop. For his work, Jetton was recognized as the top Marketing Director in Southwest Missouri by the Springfield Business Journal.<ref name=\"Ideasmyth\" /><ref name=\"SBJ Names Jetton\" /><ref name=\"Farm Investments\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Missouri Times ===\nIn 2013 Jetton Co-Founded The Missouri Times,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":17\" /> a newspaper intended to report on [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]] politics in an unbiased and bipartisan manner.
