All three (Governor Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, and Attorney General Mark Herring) were the consequently the subjects of nation-wide bipartisan calls for resignation or removal from office. The crisis started when a photo of [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Ralph Northam]]'s page in his 1984 medical school yearbook depicted an individual in [[blackface]] and an individual in a [[Ku Klux Klan]] outfit. Northam had sparked a national outcry two days earlier over comments interpreted by conservatives and [[pro-life]] groups as supporting [[infanticide]]. Amid widespread calls for Northam's resignation, [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Justin Fairfax]] had multiple sexual assault allegations raised against him dating to 2000 and 2004. [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] [[Mark Herring]] revealed shortly thereafter that he had worn [[blackface]] while in college.\n\nThe issues raised together created a crisis in Virginia as all three statewide officials were engulfed in scandal over the span of a few days and the potential of all three resigning or being forced out of office became apparent.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-of-crisis-scandal-in-virginia-ralph-northam-justin-fairfax-mark-herring-watch-today-2019-02-11/ State of Crisis: Scandal in Virginia] (CBS)</ref> It also forced Democrats to grapple with racial and sexual assault scandals within their own party.<ref>[https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/06/democrats-virginia-northam-fairfax-1148291 \u2018It\u2019s a mess\u2019: Race and gender fault lines in Virginia cripple Democrats] (Politico)</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vozzella |first1=Laura |title=Virginia Republicans see chance to bounce back amid Democratic scandals |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-republicans-see-chance-to-bounce-back-amid-democratic-scandals/2019/03/22/70885cf4-4b2a-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd_story.html |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=26 March 2019 |language=en |date=23 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nGiven the racially charged nature of the scandals, national media focused attention on Virginia's complicated history with race.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Helber |first1=Steve |title=Blackface photo is a reminder of Virginia's racist history |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/blackface-photo-reminder-virginia-s-racist-history-n968751 |accessdate=February 11, 2019 |agency=NBC News |publisher=Associated Press |date=February 7, 2019 |quote=RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The discovery last week of a racist photo on Gov.
