His other brother died before his birth. John's life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating [[Harry Houdini]]'s legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where his love for performing continued. He went to [[North Springs High School]] in [[Sandy Springs, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mdjonline.com/neighbor_newspapers/schneider-returns-to-north-springs/collection_b8a22354-c917-11e6-88b4-9f1a9b517338.html|title=Schneider returns to North Springs|website=MDJOnline.com|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Acting career===\n[[file:John Schneider and Reagans at 1982 Christmas in Washington.jpg|right|thumb|Schneider with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] during a taping of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Christmas in Washington]]'' special in 1982.]]\n\nAt the age of 17, he won the role of [[Bo Duke]], working alongside another newcomer [[Tom Wopat]] and veteran actor [[James Best]].

They returned to their roles in February 1983, only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after 7 seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled ''Opening Night at the Boar's Nest'', airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.\n\n[[File:John Schneider, Tom Welling & Brian Peterson.jpg|right|thumb|Schneider (left) with Smallville co-star Tom Welling and producer Brian Peterson]]\n\n\nIn 2001, he portrayed [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent|Jonathan Kent]], the adoptive father of [[Clark Kent]] on ''[[Smallville]]'', starring in 100 episodes before his character was killed off.

It was in the early 80's that Schneider would sign with Scotti Brothers Label and release his debut full-length, ''Now or Never'', which peaked at #8 on the US Country Billboard charts.

Continuing to release albums year after year, Schneider released ''Quiet Man'' and ''If You Believe'' and in 1984, signed with MCA Nashville. Through MCA Nashville, Schneider released ''Too Good to Stop Now'' which included his first #1 hits, \"I've Been Around Enough to Know\" and \"Country Girls,\" also peaking at #1 on the CAN Country music charts, cementing his way into the country music world. The following year, Schneider unleashed ''Tryin' To Outrun the Wind'', followed by ''A Memory Like You'' which debuted at #1 on the US Country Billboard charts, a first for Schneider.

His other brother died before his birth. John's life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating [[Harry Houdini]]'s legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where his love for performing continued.

In 1982, a tangle of legal suits with the producers over the distribution of merchandising royalties sent Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat leaving the show for most of a season. They returned to their roles in February 1983, only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after 7 seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled ''Opening Night at the Boar's Nest'', airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.\n\n[[File:John Schneider, Tom Welling & Brian Peterson.jpg|right|thumb|Schneider (left) with Smallville co-star Tom Welling and producer Brian Peterson]]\n\n\nIn 2001, he portrayed [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent|Jonathan Kent]], the adoptive father of [[Clark Kent]] on ''[[Smallville]]'', starring in 100 episodes before his character was killed off.

It was in the early 80's that Schneider would sign with Scotti Brothers Label and release his debut full-length, ''Now or Never'', which peaked at #8 on the US Country Billboard charts. Also from the album came \"It's Now or Never,\" a remake of the Elvis Presley hit, which peaked at #4 on the US Country Billboard charts in 1981 and remains the top charting Elvis cover of all time in any genre to date. Continuing to release albums year after year, Schneider released ''Quiet Man'' and ''If You Believe'' and in 1984, signed with MCA Nashville. Through MCA Nashville, Schneider released ''Too Good to Stop Now'' which included his first #1 hits, \"I've Been Around Enough to Know\" and \"Country Girls,\" also peaking at #1 on the CAN Country music charts, cementing his way into the country music world. The following year, Schneider unleashed ''Tryin' To Outrun the Wind'', followed by ''A Memory Like You'' which debuted at #1 on the US Country Billboard charts, a first for Schneider. Off the album ''A Memory Like You'' came \"What's a Memory Like You (Doing In A Love Like This)\" and \"You're The Last Thing I Needed Tonight,\" singles which both peaked at #1 on the US Country Billboard charts and CAN Country. In the late 80's, Schneider continued releasing albums including his Greatest Hits record. Taking some time off to pursue acting opportunities, Schneider would return with ''Worth The Wait'', ''John's Acoustic Christmas'', ''The Promise'' and ''Home For Christmas'', with ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' co-star Tom Wopat in 2014.[[File:JohnSchneidermg.jpg|thumb|John Schneider at a meet and greet 2019]]\nIn 2019, on January 29, LIVE, at a filming of the TV show \"Good Rockin' Tonight,\" John Schneider was Inducted on the air into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\"I hadn't done music since 1990.
