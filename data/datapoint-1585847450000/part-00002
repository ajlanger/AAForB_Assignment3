Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the metropolitan, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]], Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar . These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, SJ, Archbishop of [[Kodungallur|Cranganore]], before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBetween 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native metropolitan Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India.

Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367). Latin Catholic Carmelite clergy from Europe served as bishops, and the Church along with the Latin Catholics was under the [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of Malabar (modern-day [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly]]). As per [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]]'s travelogue [[Varthamanappusthakam]] (dated to 1790), the Church was known then as the ''Malankare Kaldaya Suriyani Sabha'' \"Malankara Chaldean Syriac Church\". In 1887, the Holy See established two [[Apostolic Vicariate]]s, [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]] and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Kottayam]] (later Changanassery) under the guidance of indigenous Syro-Malabar bishops, and named the Church as \"The Syro-Malabar Church\" to distinguish them from the Latins.<ref name=\"Nedumparambil\">{{cite web|author=George Joseph Nedumparambil|date=2013|title=A Search of the Roots of the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala|url=https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/opus4-wuerzburg/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6595/file/Joseph_Nedumparambil.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2019|publisher=University of W\u00fcrzburg}}</ref> The Holy See re-organized the Apostolic Vicariates in 1896 into three Apostolic Vicariates ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Ernakulam]], and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Changanassery]]).

This is contrary to [[WP:MOS]]--->\n\nAfter the split in the church community, the Catholics of the Malabar coast faced an identity crisis and thus some priests and laymen attempted to persuade the hierarchy to improve the identity of the local church and for the appointment of bishops from local priests. To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896. They were known as Catholic Chaldean Syrians during the period from around 1787(Angamaly Padiyola) to around 1911. They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

Menezes held the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 to bring the Thomas Christians under the authority of the Archbishopric of Goa.

The ancient or the independent church body was termed as the ''Puthenkuttukar'', or \"Party who is renewed (after shedding the catholic heresy)\", and resisted the authority of the Portuguese padroado. Under the leadership of metropolitan [[Mar Thoma I]] the ancient [[Malankara Church]] later entered into a new relationship with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of [[Antioch]].<ref name=Gregorios285>Gregorios & Roberson, p. 285.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara91>Vadakkekara, p. 91.</ref>\n\n==Coonan Cross Oath==\nA protest took place in 1653 with the [[Coonan Cross Oath]]. Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they would not obey the Jesuit Bishops or the Pope.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, \"Eastern Christianity in India\"</ref> Church historian KOOTHUR observes that \"the \u2018Coonan Cross\u2019 revolution obviously was the final outbreak of the storm that had been gathering on the horizon of the ecclesial life of the St. Thomas Christians for over a century.\"\n\nRome sent Carmelites in two groups from the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propagation of the Faith]] to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the metropolitan, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]], Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar . These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, SJ, Archbishop of [[Kodungallur|Cranganore]], before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBetween 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native metropolitan Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367).

To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896.

They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].
