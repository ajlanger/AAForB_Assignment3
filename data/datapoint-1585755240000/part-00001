Established in 1958 by [[Theodor Heuss]], the first president of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], it promotes [[individual freedom]] and liberalism. Usually still referred to as the '''Friedrich Naumann Foundation''' ({{lang|de|Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung}}), the foundation supplemented its name in 2007 with the words \"for Freedom\" (''{{lang|de|f\u00fcr die Freiheit}}'').\n\n==Overview==\nThe Foundation follows the ideals of the Protestant theologian, [[Friedrich Naumann]]. At the beginning of the last century, Naumann was a leading German liberal thinker and politician. He resolutely backed the idea of civic [[education]]. Naumann believed that a functioning [[democracy]] needs politically informed and educated [[citizen]]s. According to him, civic education is a prerequisite for [[political participation]] and thus for democracy.\n\nIn this regard, the Foundation is an agent of organized liberalism. It promotes this through civic education, international political dialogues, and political counselling. The Foundation has numerous offices in Europe, Africa, America, and Asia. It also enjoys close links with Germany\u2019s Free Democratic Party (FDP) and [[Liberal International]] (LI).\n\nWhile the Foundation\u2019s activities in the field of civic education consist of seminars, conferences and publications aimed at promoting liberal values and principles, the international political dialogue program provides a discussion forum for a wide range of liberal issues. The Foundation\u2019s counselling programs focus on candidates for political office, liberal political parties and other democratic organizations.\n\nThe Friedrich Naumann Foundation, together with other foundations of different philosophical, political and ideological orientation and the non-political [[Studienstiftung|German National Academic Foundation]], acts as an instrument for the promotion of excellence in German university education. This scholarship system is subsidised by the Federal Government of Germany.\nCurrently, the foundation sponsors around 800 students, among those 175 PhD students (as of 2009<ref>[http://www.bmbf.de/pub/begabtenfoerderungswerke.pdf Publication] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203132/http://www.bmbf.de/pub/begabtenfoerderungswerke.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }} of the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]]:</ref> (German)).
