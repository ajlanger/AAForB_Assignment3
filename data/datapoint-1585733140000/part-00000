This article focuses on the circumnavigation of [[Earth]].\n\nThe first circumnavigation of Earth was the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]], which sailed from [[Seville, Spain]] in 1519 and returned in 1522, after crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans.

The path of a true (global) circumnavigation forms a [[loop (topology)|continuous loop]] on the surface of Earth separating two regions of comparable area. A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a [[great circle]], and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points [[antipodes|antipodal]] to each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expedition360.com/home/circumnavigation.htm |title=Definition of a Circumnavigation |publisher=Expedition360.com |date=28 September 1924 |accessdate =2 July 2012}}</ref> In practice, people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints, depending on the method of travel. Since the planet is [[spheroid|quasispheroidal]], a trip from one Pole to the other, and back again on the other side, would technically be a circumnavigation. There are [[Arctic ice pack|practical difficulties]] in such a voyage, although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by [[Ranulph Fiennes]].{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\n==History==\nThe first single voyage of global circumnavigation was that of the ship ''Victoria'', between 1519 and 1522, known as the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition]]. It was a Castilian (Spanish) voyage of discovery, led initially by the Portuguese [[Ferdinand Magellan]] between 1519 and 1521, and then by the Spanish [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] from 1521 to 1522. The voyage started in [[Seville]], crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of South America, where the expedition discovered the [[Strait of Magellan]], named after the fleet's captain. It then continued across the Pacific, discovering a number of islands on its way, including [[Guam]], before arriving in the [[Philippines]]. After Magellan's death in the Philippines in 1521, Elcano took command of the expedition and continued the journey across the Indian Ocean, round the [[Cape of Good Hope]], north along the Atlantic Ocean, and back to Spain in 1522. Elcano and a small group of 18 men were the only members of the expedition to make the full circumnavigation.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Seafarers\u2014The Explorers| first= Richard |last=Humble| publisher= Time-Life Books| location= Alexandria, Virginia| year=1978}}</ref>\n\nApart from some scholars, it is not generally accepted that Magellan and some crew members (possibly some other Portuguese and the Malay-Sumatrese [[Enrique of Malacca]], who survived to the Philippines and [[Borneo]]) previously completed a full circumnavigation on several voyages, since [[Sumatra]] and [[Malacca]] (where Magellan had been twice before, in 1509 and in 1511\u20131512) lie southwest of [[Cebu]] (Philippines). If he had also been in the [[Moluccas]] islands (located southeast of Cebu) in early 1512 (dubious and controversial), he completed and clearly exceeded an entire circumnavigation of Earth in longitude\u2014though one circumnavigation in the strict sense implies a return to the same exact point. However, traveling west from Europe, in 1521, Magellan reached a region of Southeast Asia (in the [[Malay Archipelago]]), which he had reached on previous voyages traveling east. Magellan thereby achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.<ref>[http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023160813/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm |date=23 October 2014 }} ''Circumnavigations of the Globe to 1800'', Steve Dutch, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay</ref>\n\nIn 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] sent [[Francis Drake]] to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake set out from Plymouth, England in November 1577, aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'', which he renamed ''Golden Hind'' mid-voyage. In September 1578, the ship passed through the Strait of Magellan.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}</ref><ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> In June 1579, Drake landed somewhere north of Spain's northernmost claim in Alta California, which is known as [[Drakes Bay]], California. Drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in September 1580, becoming the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation.\n\nFor the wealthy, long voyages around the world, such as was done by [[Ulysses S. Grant]], became possible in the 19th century, and the two World Wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet. However, it was the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century that made circumnavigation, when compared to the Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition, quicker and safer.<ref name=\"nzh\"/>\n\n==Nautical==\nThe nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel, the trimaran [[IDEC 3]]. The record was established by six sailors: [[Francis Joyon]], [[Alex Pella]], Cl\u00e9ment Surtel, Gw\u00e9nol\u00e9 Gahinet, S\u00e9bastien Audigane and Bernard Stamm; who wrote themselves into history books on 26 January 2017, by circumnavigating the globe in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.sailspeedrecords.com/news/216-wssr-newsletter-no-281-idec-around-the-world-outright-07-02-17|title = The WSSR Council announces the establishment of a new World Recordwork | work = World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSR) |accessdate =2017-02-07}}</ref> The absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction.\n\n===Wind powered===\n[[File:CircumnavigationByTrades.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical modern sailing circumnavigation, via the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Panama Canal]] is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nThe map on the right shows, in red, a typical, non-competitive, route for a [[sailing]] circumnavigation of the world by the [[trade wind]]s and the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route roughly approximates a [[great circle]], and passes through two pairs of antipodal points. This is a route followed by many [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] sailors, going in the western direction; the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail, although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[File:CircumnavigationByCapes.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical yacht racing circumnavigation is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nIn [[yacht racing]], a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical, particularly in a non-stop race where use of the Panama and Suez Canals would be impossible. Yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles (40,000&nbsp;km) in length which crosses the [[equator]], crosses every [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] and finishes in the same port as it starts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |title=ISAF/World Sailing Speed Record Rules for individually attempted Passage Records or Performances Offshore, sec. 26.1.a, Record Courses |publisher=Sailspeedrecords.com |accessdate=2 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717063258/http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second map on the right shows the route of the [[Vend\u00e9e Globe]] round-the-world race in red; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points. Since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route (west-to-east) and a harder route (east-to-west) when circumnavigating by sail; this difficulty is magnified for [[square-rig]] vessels due to the square rig's dramatic lack of upwind ability when compared to a more modern [[Bermuda rig]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor [[around the world sailing record]]s, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63\u00b0S. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track.

Typically, these voyages begin in [[New York City]] or [[Southampton]], and proceed westward. Routes vary, either travelling through the Caribbean and then into the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal, or around [[Cape Horn]]. From there ships usually make their way to Hawaii, the islands of the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, then northward to Hong Kong, South East Asia, and India. At that point, again, routes may vary: one way is through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean; the other is around [[Cape of Good Hope]] and then up the west coast of Africa. These cruises end in the port where they began.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe current mechanically powered circumnavigation record of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes<ref>https://www.uimpowerboating.com/Records1.aspx</ref> was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran [[Earthrace]] which was completed on 27 June 2008. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean Sea route in a westerly direction.\n\n==Aviation==\nSince the development of commercial aviation, there are regular routes that circle the globe, such as [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] Flight One (and later [[United Airlines]] Flight One). Today planning such a trip through commercial flight connections is simple.\n\nThe [[First aerial circumnavigation|first successful attempt]] to circumnavigate the planet by air occurred in 1924, flown by aviators of the [[U.S. Army Air Service]] in a quartet of [[Douglas World Cruiser]] biplanes.\n\nThe first [[Aerostat|lighter-than-air]] aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the [[rigid airship]] [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']], which did so in 1929.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nAviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world; in particular the [[jet stream]]s, which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator. There is therefore no requirement to cross the equator, or to pass through two antipodal points, in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record. Thus, for example, [[Steve Fossett]]'s global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor powered aviation, the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least {{convert|36770|km|nmi}} long (which is approximately the length of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section 2: Powered Aerodynes: Speed around the world non-stop and non-refuelled |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] |format=PDF |date=January 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211204923/http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |archive-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn ballooning, which is totally at the mercy of the winds, the requirements are even more relaxed. The course must cross all meridians, and must include a set of checkpoints which are all outside of two circles, chosen by the pilot, having radii of {{convert|3335.85|km|mi}} and enclosing the poles (though not necessarily centred on them).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/documents/sportingcode/sc1 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section&nbsp;1: Aerostats: Around-the-World Records

This article focuses on the circumnavigation of [[Earth]].\n\nThe first circumnavigation of Earth was the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]], which sailed from [[Seville, Spain]] in 1519 and returned in 1522, after crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans. Since the rise of [[commercial aviation]] in the late 20th century, circumnavigating Earth is straightforward, usually taking days instead of years.<ref name=\"nzh\">{{cite web|last1=Howie|first1=Cherie|title=Kiwi airline exec breaks record for world circumnavigation on commercial airlines|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11983099|website=New Zealand Herald|publisher=New Zealand Media and Entertainment|accessdate=17 June 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617200711/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11983099|archivedate=17 June 2019|date=27 January 2018}}</ref> Today, the challenge of circumnavigating Earth has shifted towards human and technological endurance, speed, and [[List of circumnavigations#Miscellaneous|less conventional methods]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''circumnavigation'' is a noun formed from the verb ''circumnavigate'', from the past participle of the [[Latin]] verb ''[[:wikt:circumnavigare#Latin|circumnavigare]]'', from ''circum'' \"around\" + ''navigare'' \"to sail\" (see further [[Navigation#Etymology|Navigation \u00a7 Etymology]]).<ref>{{OEtymD|circumnavigate}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nA person walking completely around either pole will cross all [[meridian (geography)|meridians]], but this is not generally considered a \"circumnavigation\". The path of a true (global) circumnavigation forms a [[loop (topology)|continuous loop]] on the surface of Earth separating two regions of comparable area. A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a [[great circle]], and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points [[antipodes|antipodal]] to each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expedition360.com/home/circumnavigation.htm |title=Definition of a Circumnavigation |publisher=Expedition360.com |date=28 September 1924 |accessdate =2 July 2012}}</ref> In practice, people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints, depending on the method of travel. Since the planet is [[spheroid|quasispheroidal]], a trip from one Pole to the other, and back again on the other side, would technically be a circumnavigation. There are [[Arctic ice pack|practical difficulties]] in such a voyage, although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by [[Ranulph Fiennes]].{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\n==History==\nThe first single voyage of global circumnavigation was that of the ship ''Victoria'', between 1519 and 1522, known as the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition]]. It was a Castilian (Spanish) voyage of discovery, led initially by the Portuguese [[Ferdinand Magellan]] between 1519 and 1521, and then by the Spanish [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] from 1521 to 1522. The voyage started in [[Seville]], crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of South America, where the expedition discovered the [[Strait of Magellan]], named after the fleet's captain. It then continued across the Pacific, discovering a number of islands on its way, including [[Guam]], before arriving in the [[Philippines]]. After Magellan's death in the Philippines in 1521, Elcano took command of the expedition and continued the journey across the Indian Ocean, round the [[Cape of Good Hope]], north along the Atlantic Ocean, and back to Spain in 1522. Elcano and a small group of 18 men were the only members of the expedition to make the full circumnavigation.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Seafarers\u2014The Explorers| first= Richard |last=Humble| publisher= Time-Life Books| location= Alexandria, Virginia| year=1978}}</ref>\n\nApart from some scholars, it is not generally accepted that Magellan and some crew members (possibly some other Portuguese and the Malay-Sumatrese [[Enrique of Malacca]], who survived to the Philippines and [[Borneo]]) previously completed a full circumnavigation on several voyages, since [[Sumatra]] and [[Malacca]] (where Magellan had been twice before, in 1509 and in 1511\u20131512) lie southwest of [[Cebu]] (Philippines). If he had also been in the [[Moluccas]] islands (located southeast of Cebu) in early 1512 (dubious and controversial), he completed and clearly exceeded an entire circumnavigation of Earth in longitude\u2014though one circumnavigation in the strict sense implies a return to the same exact point. However, traveling west from Europe, in 1521, Magellan reached a region of Southeast Asia (in the [[Malay Archipelago]]), which he had reached on previous voyages traveling east. Magellan thereby achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.<ref>[http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023160813/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm |date=23 October 2014 }} ''Circumnavigations of the Globe to 1800'', Steve Dutch, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay</ref>\n\nIn 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] sent [[Francis Drake]] to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake set out from Plymouth, England in November 1577, aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'', which he renamed ''Golden Hind'' mid-voyage. In September 1578, the ship passed through the Strait of Magellan.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}</ref><ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> In June 1579, Drake landed somewhere north of Spain's northernmost claim in Alta California, which is known as [[Drakes Bay]], California. Drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in September 1580, becoming the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation.\n\nFor the wealthy, long voyages around the world, such as was done by [[Ulysses S. Grant]], became possible in the 19th century, and the two World Wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet. However, it was the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century that made circumnavigation, when compared to the Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition, quicker and safer.<ref name=\"nzh\"/>\n\n==Nautical==\nThe nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel, the trimaran [[IDEC 3]]. The record was established by six sailors: [[Francis Joyon]], [[Alex Pella]], Cl\u00e9ment Surtel, Gw\u00e9nol\u00e9 Gahinet, S\u00e9bastien Audigane and Bernard Stamm; who wrote themselves into history books on 26 January 2017, by circumnavigating the globe in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.sailspeedrecords.com/news/216-wssr-newsletter-no-281-idec-around-the-world-outright-07-02-17|title = The WSSR Council announces the establishment of a new World Recordwork | work = World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSR) |accessdate =2017-02-07}}</ref> The absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction.\n\n===Wind powered===\n[[File:CircumnavigationByTrades.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical modern sailing circumnavigation, via the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Panama Canal]] is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nThe map on the right shows, in red, a typical, non-competitive, route for a [[sailing]] circumnavigation of the world by the [[trade wind]]s and the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route roughly approximates a [[great circle]], and passes through two pairs of antipodal points. This is a route followed by many [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] sailors, going in the western direction; the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail, although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[File:CircumnavigationByCapes.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical yacht racing circumnavigation is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nIn [[yacht racing]], a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical, particularly in a non-stop race where use of the Panama and Suez Canals would be impossible. Yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles (40,000&nbsp;km) in length which crosses the [[equator]], crosses every [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] and finishes in the same port as it starts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |title=ISAF/World Sailing Speed Record Rules for individually attempted Passage Records or Performances Offshore, sec. 26.1.a, Record Courses |publisher=Sailspeedrecords.com |accessdate=2 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717063258/http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second map on the right shows the route of the [[Vend\u00e9e Globe]] round-the-world race in red; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points. Since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route (west-to-east) and a harder route (east-to-west) when circumnavigating by sail; this difficulty is magnified for [[square-rig]] vessels due to the square rig's dramatic lack of upwind ability when compared to a more modern [[Bermuda rig]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor [[around the world sailing record]]s, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63\u00b0S. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track.

Typically, these voyages begin in [[New York City]] or [[Southampton]], and proceed westward. Routes vary, either travelling through the Caribbean and then into the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal, or around [[Cape Horn]]. From there ships usually make their way to Hawaii, the islands of the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, then northward to Hong Kong, South East Asia, and India. At that point, again, routes may vary: one way is through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean; the other is around [[Cape of Good Hope]] and then up the west coast of Africa. These cruises end in the port where they began.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe current mechanically powered circumnavigation record of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes<ref>https://www.uimpowerboating.com/Records1.aspx</ref> was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran [[Earthrace]] which was completed on 27 June 2008. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean Sea route in a westerly direction.\n\n==Aviation==\nSince the development of commercial aviation, there are regular routes that circle the globe, such as [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] Flight One (and later [[United Airlines]] Flight One). Today planning such a trip through commercial flight connections is simple.\n\nThe [[First aerial circumnavigation|first successful attempt]] to circumnavigate the planet by air occurred in 1924, flown by aviators of the [[U.S. Army Air Service]] in a quartet of [[Douglas World Cruiser]] biplanes.\n\nThe first [[Aerostat|lighter-than-air]] aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the [[rigid airship]] [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']], which did so in 1929.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nAviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world; in particular the [[jet stream]]s, which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator. There is therefore no requirement to cross the equator, or to pass through two antipodal points, in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record. Thus, for example, [[Steve Fossett]]'s global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor powered aviation, the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least {{convert|36770|km|nmi}} long (which is approximately the length of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section 2: Powered Aerodynes: Speed around the world non-stop and non-refuelled |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] |format=PDF |date=January 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211204923/http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |archive-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn ballooning, which is totally at the mercy of the winds, the requirements are even more relaxed.

(though not necessarily centred on them).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/documents/sportingcode/sc1 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section&nbsp;1: Aerostats: Around-the-World Records
