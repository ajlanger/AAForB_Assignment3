Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]].

Like [[mule]]s and [[hinny]]s, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting [[meiosis]].\n\n==Genetics==\nDonkeys and wild equids have different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. A donkey has 62 chromosomes; the zebra has between 32 and 46 (depending on the species). In spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid has a number of chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K.

And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Z\u00e9brulecouch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|A zorse]]\nZebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.

The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K.

And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Z\u00e9brulecouch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|A zorse]]\nZebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with a ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.
