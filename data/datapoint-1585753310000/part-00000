He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
