The policy change to a more liberalized economy is identified using SEZ variables as instrumental variables. The results indicate that export and [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] growth have positive and [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] effects on economic growth in these countries. The presence of SEZs increases regional growth but increasing the number of SEZs has negligible effect on growth. The key to faster economic growth appears to be a greater pace of liberalization.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Economy of China]]\n* [[Megalopolises in China]]\n* [[New areas]]\n* [[Special administrative regions of China]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Chee Kian Leong, 2007, A Tale of Two Countries: Openness and Growth in China and India [http://www.degit.ifw-kiel.de/papers/degit_12/C012_042.pdf], Dynamics, Economic Growth, and International Trade (DEGIT) Conference Paper.\n* Chee Kian Leong, (forthcoming), Special economic zones and growth in China and India: an empirical investigation,[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10368-012-0223-6] International Economics and Economic Policy.\n\n== External links ==\n*Chung-Tong Wu.
