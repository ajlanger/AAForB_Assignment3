Leigh called Eileen and told them that her 15-years younger sister, [[Suzy Parker]], was making only $25 per hour working as a model for [[Huntington Hartford]].<ref name=\"everything\"/> Leigh felt Suzy, although only 16 years old, should be making $40 per hour, and told Ford she would join her two-year-old agency only if they took Parker sight-unseen.

Soon thereafter, Parker would become the most successful model of the 1950s, helping push the Ford's agency to number one. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Fords represented top models [[Mary Jane Russell]], [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]], and [[Dovima]]. By 1954, the Fords were extremely successful and were living in a duplex apartment on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]].

That's why I'm so docile now.\" By the late 1950s, Eileen had given birth to four children: Jamie, Billy, Katie, and Lacey.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nIn 1957, Leigh, aged 40 and retired from modeling, was living in France. She decided to start another modeling agency, this time in France. The police and courts insisted she was running an illegal employment agency, and she was fined. After World War II, employment agencies were declared illegal.<ref name=\"model\"/> Leigh contacted the Fords about starting a legitimate modeling agency, the first of its kind in that country. She continued to run a successful agency, but in 1959 was charged in court again. After hiring a lawyer, she finally won her case. The Fords agreed to expand their modeling business into Europe, and Leigh would represent them in France as well as scout for potential models all over Europe. Leigh was so successful that she opened branches in London and Hamburg, Germany. She would trade her European models for Ford's American models and vice versa.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ford represented then-model [[Martha Stewart]], who like Eileen, went to [[Barnard College]]. Stewart modeled briefly in her late teens and early 20s, including for [[Chanel]]. In the 1970s, Stewart catered parties and weddings with Dorian Leigh, who became a cordon bleu level chef after retiring from the fashion industry. On the twentieth anniversary of the Ford Agency in 1966, Jerry Ford told ''The New York Times'' that they were billing $100,000 per week and that they were the first modeling agency to have a computer system. They had 175 female and 75 male models that booked 70% of modeling jobs in New York City and 30% worldwide.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nTheir top models in the 1960s included [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] (who would go on to run a successful modeling agency of her own in the 1970s, until her death from lung cancer due to heavy smoking in 1980, at age 40), [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Ann Turkel]], [[Agneta Frieberg]], [[Ali MacGraw]], [[Candice Bergen]], Tilly Tizani, [[Sondra Peterson]], and [[Donna Michelle]]. In 1968, Ford ''Eileen Ford's Book of Model Beauty'', which gave beauty tips and nutrition and exercise advice. The book included a biography and photos of Ford's most successful models from the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ford was still the number-one modeling agency in the world. It represented [[Jerry Hall]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Janice Dickinson]], [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Karen Graham]], [[Susan Blakely]], and others. Hutton and Graham were the earliest models to get exclusive make-up contracts with [[Revlon]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]. By 1977 however, [[John Casablancas]], who started [[Elite Model Management|Elite]], began to poach Ford's top models and her top booking agent, Monique Pillard. The Fords tried to sue Casablancas,{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} and hired famed attorney [[Roy Cohn]].<!-- so what happened? --> They also competed with several smaller modeling agencies, such as [[Wilhelmina Models|Wilhelmina]], which represented such late 1970s models as [[Gia Carangi]], [[Patti Hansen]] and [[Shaun Casey]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDuring this time, Ford Models expanded their agency. A successful Men's Division would dominate the pages of ''[[GQ]]'' magazine. In 1975, the Fords started a children's division. In her Lifetime Intimate Portrait, Eileen Ford said they started that division with [[Brooke Shields]], then 9 years old, in mind. Shields was already an established model when the Fords signed her. She shot her first national advertising campaign with [[Francesco Scavullo]] in 1966 for [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory soap]]. It was during that first year with Ford that she shot the infamous photos with photographer [[Garry Gross]]. According to court records, Brooke was paid $450 for the photo session.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBy the late 1970s, the \"model wars\" between Elite and Ford were in full stride with top models going back-and-forth between Elite, Ford, and smaller agencies like Zoli, which represented [[Rachel Ward]] and Esm\u00e9 Marshall. By this time, many top models were getting terrible reputations for drug use, staying out all night at [[Studio 54]] and for being very unprofessional.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, Eileen said several of Ford's models from the 1950s and 1960s had died from smoking and breast cancer.<ref name=\"glamour\"/> Some 1970s models died from drug use, including Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS in 1986. Top fashion photographers, tired of these models' behavior, refused to work with them any longer. In 1981, the Fords began an international modeling competition called \"Face of the 80s\", later known as [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]]. By the mid-1980s, drug-addicted blonde models were out, and more professional, brunette-haired models such as [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Ren\u00e9e Simonsen]], [[Carol Alt]], [[Linda Evangelista]], and [[Christy Turlington]] came on the scene. As a result, modeling fees rapidly accelerated and several models were making millions of dollars per year. Fashion editor Polly Mellen said, \"The girls are getting rich, so rich.\"<ref name=\"model\"/> Turlington, at the age of 16, moved into Ford's townhouse during the summer of 1985, and would rapidly become one of the Ford's biggest successes ever.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1993, Eileen said that her agency received 10,000 letters per year and 7,000 personal visits to her office. Of these, she said, maybe only four or five are \"really good ones [models]\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ford's Famous X-Factor |journal=American Photo |date=May\u2013June 1993 |page=72}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1993, Ford's home in [[Tewksbury Township, New Jersey]], was almost completely destroyed in a fire.<ref>{{cite news |last=Speers |first=W |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A48AE61900E0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Model-Agency Fords Lose N.

She was CEO from 1995 to 2007. In December 2007, Ford was sold to Stone Tower Equity Partners. John Caplan took over as CEO while Katie Ford was on the Board of Directors. Jerry Ford died at the age 83 on August 24, 2008.

It represented [[Jerry Hall]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Janice Dickinson]], [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Karen Graham]], [[Susan Blakely]], and others. Hutton and Graham were the earliest models to get exclusive make-up contracts with [[Revlon]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]. By 1977 however, [[John Casablancas]], who started [[Elite Model Management|Elite]], began to poach Ford's top models and her top booking agent, Monique Pillard. The Fords tried to sue Casablancas,{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} and hired famed attorney [[Roy Cohn]].<!-- so what happened? --> They also competed with several smaller modeling agencies, such as [[Wilhelmina Models|Wilhelmina]], which represented such late 1970s models as [[Gia Carangi]], [[Patti Hansen]] and [[Shaun Casey]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDuring this time, Ford Models expanded their agency. A successful Men's Division would dominate the pages of ''[[GQ]]'' magazine. In 1975, the Fords started a children's division. In her Lifetime Intimate Portrait, Eileen Ford said they started that division with [[Brooke Shields]], then 9 years old, in mind. Shields was already an established model when the Fords signed her. She shot her first national advertising campaign with [[Francesco Scavullo]] in 1966 for [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory soap]]. It was during that first year with Ford that she shot the infamous photos with photographer [[Garry Gross]]. According to court records, Brooke was paid $450 for the photo session.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBy the late 1970s, the \"model wars\" between Elite and Ford were in full stride with top models going back-and-forth between Elite, Ford, and smaller agencies like Zoli, which represented [[Rachel Ward]] and Esm\u00e9 Marshall. By this time, many top models were getting terrible reputations for drug use, staying out all night at [[Studio 54]] and for being very unprofessional.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, Eileen said several of Ford's models from the 1950s and 1960s had died from smoking and breast cancer.<ref name=\"glamour\"/> Some 1970s models died from drug use, including Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS in 1986. Top fashion photographers, tired of these models' behavior, refused to work with them any longer. In 1981, the Fords began an international modeling competition called \"Face of the 80s\", later known as [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]]. By the mid-1980s, drug-addicted blonde models were out, and more professional, brunette-haired models such as [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Ren\u00e9e Simonsen]], [[Carol Alt]], [[Linda Evangelista]], and [[Christy Turlington]] came on the scene. As a result, modeling fees rapidly accelerated and several models were making millions of dollars per year. Fashion editor Polly Mellen said, \"The girls are getting rich, so rich.\"<ref name=\"model\"/> Turlington, at the age of 16, moved into Ford's townhouse during the summer of 1985, and would rapidly become one of the Ford's biggest successes ever.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1993, Eileen said that her agency received 10,000 letters per year and 7,000 personal visits to her office. Of these, she said, maybe only four or five are \"really good ones [models]\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ford's Famous X-Factor |journal=American Photo |date=May\u2013June 1993 |page=72}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1993, Ford's home in [[Tewksbury Township, New Jersey]], was almost completely destroyed in a fire.<ref>{{cite news |last=Speers |first=W |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A48AE61900E0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Model-Agency Fords Lose N.
