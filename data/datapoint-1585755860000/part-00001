(2015), [[autosome|autosomic]] tests indicate that the Yamnaya people were the result of a genetic admixture between two different hunter-gatherer populations: distinctive \"Eastern European hunter-gatherers\" with high affinity to the [[Mal'ta\u2013Buret' culture]] or other, [[Afontova Gora|closely related]] people from [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]]{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}} and a population of \"Caucasus hunter-gatherers\" who probably arrived from the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Jones|Gonzalez-Fortes|Connell|Siska|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA.{{sfn|Mathieson|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> According to co-author Andrea Manica of the [[University of Cambridge]]:\n{{quote|The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now ... we can now answer that, as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation.<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/>}}\n\nSeveral genetic studies performed since 2015 have given support to the [[Kurgan theory]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]] regarding the [[Indo-European Urheimat]] \u2013 that Indo-European languages spread throughout Europe from the Eurasian steppes and that the Yamnaya culture were Proto-Indo-Europeans. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia), would have expanded from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppes, along with the Indo-European languages. They also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages in the Bronze Age.{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}<ref name=\"allen\" /><ref>{{cite biorxiv |biorxiv=016477 |title=Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe |author=Mathieson |display-authors=etal |year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dnieper-Donets male (Volniensky).jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|[[Forensic facial reconstruction]] of a male from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]].

This admixture is referred to as [[Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH), and has earlier been found among the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Khvalynsk culture]], who preceded the Yamnaya culture on the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Unlike their Khvalynsk predecessors however, the Y-DNA of the Yamnaya is exclusively of EHG and WHG origin. This suggests that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG and WHG paternal origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=36}} Admixture between EHGs and CHGs is believed to have occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe around 5,000 BC, while admixture with EEFs happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later. As Yamnaya Y-DNA is exclusively of the EHG and WHG type, the admixture appears to have occurred between EHG and WHG males, and CHG and EEF females. According to [[David W.

Haplogroups U5 and U4 are typical of [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s. A generic similarity between Catacomb people and northern hunter-gatherers, particularly the people of the [[Pitted Ware culture]] of southern [[Scandinavia]], was detected.

(2015), [[autosome|autosomic]] tests indicate that the Yamnaya people were the result of a genetic admixture between two different hunter-gatherer populations: distinctive \"Eastern European hunter-gatherers\" with high affinity to the [[Mal'ta\u2013Buret' culture]] or other, [[Afontova Gora|closely related]] people from [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]]{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}} and a population of \"Caucasus hunter-gatherers\" who probably arrived from the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Jones|Gonzalez-Fortes|Connell|Siska|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA.{{sfn|Mathieson|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> According to co-author Andrea Manica of the [[University of Cambridge]]:\n{{quote|The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now ... we can now answer that, as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation.<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/>}}\n\nSeveral genetic studies performed since 2015 have given support to the [[Kurgan theory]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]] regarding the [[Indo-European Urheimat]] \u2013 that Indo-European languages spread throughout Europe from the Eurasian steppes and that the Yamnaya culture were Proto-Indo-Europeans. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia), would have expanded from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppes, along with the Indo-European languages. They also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages in the Bronze Age.{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}<ref name=\"allen\" /><ref>{{cite biorxiv |biorxiv=016477 |title=Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe |author=Mathieson |display-authors=etal |year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dnieper-Donets male (Volniensky).jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|[[Forensic facial reconstruction]] of a male from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]].

This admixture is referred to as [[Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH), and has earlier been found among the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Khvalynsk culture]], who preceded the Yamnaya culture on the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Unlike their Khvalynsk predecessors however, the Y-DNA of the Yamnaya is exclusively of EHG and WHG origin. This suggests that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG and WHG paternal origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=36}} Admixture between EHGs and CHGs is believed to have occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe around 5,000 BC, while admixture with EEFs happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later. As Yamnaya Y-DNA is exclusively of the EHG and WHG type, the admixture appears to have occurred between EHG and WHG males, and CHG and EEF females. According to [[David W.

Catacomb people were found to have much higher frequencies of the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] than people of the Yamnaya culture. Haplogroups U5 and U4 are typical of [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s. A generic similarity between Catacomb people and northern hunter-gatherers, particularly the people of the [[Pitted Ware culture]] of southern [[Scandinavia]], was detected. It was suggested that the Catacomb people and the Yamnaya people were not as genetically admixed as previously believed.

All the anthropological types of the Pit-grave culture population have indigenous roots... The heir of the Neolithic Dnieper-Donets and Sredniy Stog cultures was the Pit-grave culture. Its population possessed distinct Europoid features, was tall, with massive skulls. The second component were the descendants of those buried in the Eneolithic cemetery of Khvalynsk. They are less robust.\"{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007|pp=383-385}} }} The later southward advance of the [[Srubnaya culture]] into the former territories of the Yamnaya is accompanied with increasing dolichocephaly among skulls of the southern steppe, probably through the merging of Srubnaya people with descendants of the Yamnaya among the [[Poltavka culture]] and [[Catacomb culture]]. The dolichocephalic Europoid type prevalent among the Srubnaya had earlier been found among the [[Fatyanovo\u2013Balanovo culture]], [[Abashevo culture]], [[Sintashta culture]] and [[Andronovo culture]], which were themselves ultimately partially derived from Yamnaya.{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007|pp=383-385}}\n\nThe genetic basis of a number of physical features of the Yamnaya people were ascertained by the ancient DNA studies conducted by Haak ''et al.''
