Two subspecies are recognised, the [[Jamaica]]n ''T. e. euchrysea'' and ''T. e. sclateri'' of [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]). It usually inhabits the hills on the interior of islands, preferring open country. Currently, this swallow is restricted to isolated [[montane forest]]s that primarily consist of the [[Hispaniolan pine]]. This species is considered to be a [[vulnerable species]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN); the nominate subspecies, ''T. e. euchrysea'', is likely extinct. The exact cause of extinction is unknown, but likely factors include predation by [[Introduced species|introduced]] [[mammal]]s and [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], although the habitat loss theory is not supported by much evidence. The last sighting of the nominate subspecies was in [[Hardwar Gap]] (located on the boundary between [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew]] and [[Portland Parish|Portland]] parishes), with three birds being seen on 8 June 1989.\n\nA relatively small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze sides of the head. The ears and [[Lore (anatomy)|lores]] are duller and the forehead area is more green than [[bronze]]. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-[[coverts]] are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and [[Iris (anatomy)|irides]] are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with its breast, and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts, being mottled grey-brown. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, ''T. e. sclateri'', is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.\n\nIn Hispaniola, this swallow breeds from April to July, where it lays a [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] consisting of two to four white eggs. It formerly bred from June to July in Jamaica. The eggs are laid in a [[cup nest]] that is mainly found in Hispaniolan pine. It also nests in caves, under the eaves of houses, in burned stands, and in nest boxes. This swallow is an aerial [[insectivore]], foraging for insects at heights that are usually under {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and very rarely at heights over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}. When foraging, it is known to explore most habitats except forests.\n\n==Taxonomy and etymology==\nThe golden swallow was first described as ''Hirundo euchrysea'' by English naturalist [[Philip Henry Gosse|Henry Gosse]], in his 1847 book ''The Birds of Jamaica'',<ref name=\"Gosse1847\">{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Philip Henry|title=The Birds of Jamaica|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/21519975#page/84/mode/1up|location=[[London]]|year=1847|publisher=J.

Two subspecies are recognised, the [[Jamaica]]n ''T. e. euchrysea'' and ''T. e. sclateri'' of [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]). It usually inhabits the hills on the interior of islands, preferring open country. Currently, this swallow is restricted to isolated [[montane forest]]s that primarily consist of the [[Hispaniolan pine]]. This species is considered to be a [[vulnerable species]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN); the nominate subspecies, ''T. e. euchrysea'', is likely extinct. The exact cause of extinction is unknown, but likely factors include predation by [[Introduced species|introduced]] [[mammal]]s and [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], although the habitat loss theory is not supported by much evidence. The last sighting of the nominate subspecies was in [[Hardwar Gap]] (located on the boundary between [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew]] and [[Portland Parish|Portland]] parishes), with three birds being seen on 8 June 1989.\n\nA relatively small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze sides of the head. The ears and [[lores]] are duller and the forehead area is more green than [[bronze]]. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-[[coverts]] are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and [[Iris (anatomy)|irides]] are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with its breast, and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts, being mottled grey-brown. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, ''T. e. sclateri'', is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.\n\nIn Hispaniola, this swallow breeds from April to July, where it lays a [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] consisting of two to four white eggs. It formerly bred from June to July in Jamaica. The eggs are laid in a [[cup nest]] that is mainly found in Hispaniolan pine. It also nests in caves, under the eaves of houses, in burned stands, and in nest boxes. This swallow is an aerial [[insectivore]], foraging for insects at heights that are usually under {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and very rarely at heights over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}. When foraging, it is known to explore most habitats except forests.\n\n==Taxonomy and etymology==\nThe golden swallow was first described as ''Hirundo euchrysea'' by English naturalist [[Philip Henry Gosse|Henry Gosse]], in his 1847 book ''The Birds of Jamaica'',<ref name=\"Gosse1847\">{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Philip Henry|title=The Birds of Jamaica|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/21519975#page/84/mode/1up|location=[[London]]|year=1847|publisher=J.
