The main members of this movement are [[Vuk \u0106osi\u0107]], [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi.org]], [[Alexei Shulgin]], [[Olia Lialina]], and [[Heath Bunting]] ([[irational.org]], [[Daniel Garc\u00eda And\u00fajar]], Heath Bunting, Rachel Baker and Minerva Cuevas). Although this group was formed as a [[parody]] of [[avant garde]] movements by writers such as Tilman Baumg\u00e4rtel, Josephine Bosma, Hans Dieter Huber and Pit Schultz, their individual works have little in common.\n\nThe term \"net.art\" is also used as a synonym for net art or Internet art and covers a much wider range of artistic practices. In this wider definition, net.art can also be a work of art that exists entirely or partially offline. Alexei Shulgin's performance Cyberknowledge for Real People in the streets of Vienna comes to mind, and also Heath Bunting's many projects in the streets of London. \n\nThe German critic [[Tilman Baumg\u00e4rtel]] - building on the ideas of American critic [[Clement Greenberg]] - has frequently argued for a \"media specificity\" of net.art in his writings. According to the introduction to his book \"net.art. Materialien zur Netzkunst\", the specific qualities of net.art are \"connectivity, global reach, multimediality, immateriality, interactivity and egality\".<ref>Baumg\u00e4rtel, T. (1999). net.art.

As such, net.art is more of a movement and a critical and political landmark in Internet art history, than a specific [[genre]]. Early precursors of the net.art movement include the international [[fluxus]] (Nam June Paik) and avant-pop ([[Mark Amerika]]) movements. The avant-pop movement particularly became widely recognized in Internet circles from 1993, largely via the popular [[Alt-X]] site.\n\nThe term \"net.art\" has been wrongly attributed to artist [[Vuk Cosic]] in 1997, after Alexei Shulgin wrote about the origin of the term in a prank mail to the nettime mailinglist.<ref>Weibel, P & Druckrey, T eds.

They have a large presence on several [[mailing lists]] such as [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]], File festival, [[Electronic Language International Festival]], [[Nettime]], Syndicate and Eyebeam. The identity of the net.artists is defined by both their digital works and their critical involvement in the digital art community,  as the polemical discussion led by Olia Lialina that occurred on [[Nettime]] in early 2006 on the \"New Media\" Wikipedia entry shows<ref>Lialina, O [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0511/threads.html#00025 A New Definition], Nettime Archive List</ref>\n\nnet.artists like [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi]] developed a particular form of e-mail art, or [[E-mail spam|spam]] mail art, through text reprocessing and [[ASCII art]].

The artists involved in net.art experiments are associated with the idea of a \"social responsibility\" that would answer the idea of democracy as a modern capitalist myth. The Internet, often promoted as the democratic tool par excellence, but largely participating in the rules of vested interests, is targeted by the net.artists who claimed that \"a space where you can buy is a space where you can steal, but also where you can distribute\". net.artists focus on finding new ways of sharing [[public space]].\n\nBy questioning structures such as the navigation window and challenging their functionality, net.artists have shown that what is considered to be natural by most Internet users is actually highly constructed, even controlled, by corporations. Company browsers like [[Netscape Navigator]] or [[Internet Explorer]] display user-friendly structures (the \"navigation\", the \"exploration\" are landmarks of social practices) to provide the user with a familiar environment; net.artists try to break this familiarity. Olia Lialina, in ''[[My Boyfriend Came Back From The War]]''<ref>[http://www.teleportacia.org/war/ My boyfriend came back from the war. After dinner they left us alone.]</ref> or the duo Jodi, with their series of pop-up interventions and browser crashing applets, have engaged the materiality of navigation in their work. Their experiments have given birth to what could be called \"browser art\", which has been expanded by the British collective [[I/O/D]]'s experimental navigator WebStalker.\n\nAlexei Shulgin and Heath Bunting have played with the structure of advertisement portals by establishing lists of keywords unlikely to be searched for but nonetheless existing on the web as URLs or metadata components: they use this relational data to enmesh paths of navigation in order to create new readable texts {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. The user is not exploring one art website that has its own meaning and [[aesthetic]] significance within itself, but rather they are exposed to the entire network as a collection of socioeconomic forces and political stances that are not always visible.\n\nRachel Greene has associated net.art with [[tactical media]] as a form of [[Detournement]]. Greene writes: \"The subversion of corporate websites shares a blurry border with hacking and agitprop practices that would become an important field of net art, often referred to as 'tactical media'.\"<ref name=\"Greene\"/>\n\n== Hacker culture ==\nThe Jodi collective works with the aesthetics of computer errors, which has a lot in common, on both the aesthetic and pragmatic levels, with [[hacker culture]]. Questioning and disturbing the browsing experience with hacks, code tricks, faux-code, and faux-virus, critically investigates the context in which they are agents. In turn, the digital environment becomes concerned with its own internal structure. The collective [[0100101110101101.org]] expands the idea of \"art hacktivism\" by performing code interventions and perturbations in art festivals such as the [[Venice Biennale]]. On the other hand, the collective irational.org expands the idea of \"art hacktivism\" by performing interventions and perturbations in the real world, acting on it as on a possible ground for social reengineering.\n\n\"We can point to a superficial difference between most net.art and hacking: hackers have an obsession with getting inside other computer systems and having an agency there, whereas the 404 errors in the JTDDS (for example) only engage other systems in an intentionally wrong manner in order to store a 'secret' message in their error logs. It's nice to think of artists as hackers who endeavour to get inside cultural systems and make them do things they were never intended to do: artists as culture hackers.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thing.net/eyebeam/msg00527.html|title=<eyebeam><blast> 404|date=1998-05-01|publisher=thing.net|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Critique of the art world ==\n\nDuring the heyday of net.art developments, particularly during the rise of global [[Dot-com bubble|dot.com]] capitalism, the first series of critical columns appeared in German and English in the online publication [[Telepolis]]. Edited by writer and artist [[Armin Medosch]], the work published at Telepolis featured American artist and net theorist Mark Amerika's \"Amerika Online\" columns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/ame.html|title=Amerika Online|publisher=Telepolis|accessdate=2009-03-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504081712/http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/ame.html|archivedate=2009-05-04}}</ref> These columns satirized the way self-effacing net.artists (himself included) took themselves too seriously. In response, European net.artists impersonated Amerika in faux emails to deconstruct his demystification of the marketing schemes most net.artists employed to achieve art world legitimacy. It was suggested that \"the duplicitous dispatches were meant to raise US awareness of electronic artists in Europe, and may even contain an element of jealousy.\"<ref>Mirapaul, M [http://cramer.plaintext.cc:70/personal_archives/codework/7-11/7-11.mbox%7C/MBOX-MESSAGE/1628 War of the Words: Ersatz E-Mail Tilts at Art], ''New York Times''</ref>\n\nMany of these net.art interventions also tackled the issue of art as business and investigated mainstream cultural institutions such as the [[Tate Modern]]. Harwood,  a member of the Mongrel collective, in his work ''Uncomfortable Proximity''<ref>[http://www2.tate.org.uk/netart/mongrel/home/default.htm Uncomfortable Proximity]</ref> (the first on-line project commissioned by Tate) mirrors the Tate's own website, and offers new images and ideas, collaged from his own experiences, his readings of Tate works, and publicity materials that inform his interest in the [[Tate]] website{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.\n\nnet.artists have actively participated in the debate over the definition of net.art within the context of the art market. net.art promoted the [[modernist]] idea of the work of art as a ''process'', as opposed to a conception of art as object making {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  [[Alexander R. Galloway]], in an e-flux article entitled \"Jodi's Infrastructure\" argues that Jodi's approach to net.art, which involves the very structures that govern coding,  is uniquely modernist: the form and content converge in the artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/|title=Jodi\u2019s Infrastructure - Journal #74 June 2016 - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>   The presentation of this process within the art world\u2014whether it should be sold in the market, or shown in the institutional art environment, is problematic for digital works {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} created for the [[Internet]].

Each piece of net.art has its originality protected by a guarantee constituted by its [[URL]], which acts as a barrier against reproducibility and/or forgery. Lialina claimed that this allowed the buyer of the piece to own it as they wished: controlling the location address as a means of controlling access to the piece.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This attempt at giving net.art an economic identity and a legitimation within the art world was questioned even within the net.art sphere, though the project was often understood as a [[satire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors3/drfuturetext.html|title=Net Art Market: What Happens Next?|last=Wright|first=Richard|date=1998-08-25|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Teo Spiller]] really sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum in May 1999, calling the whole project of selling the net.art.trade.<ref>Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html \"There May Be Money in Internet Art After All\"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''</ref>[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]] [[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art) 2.jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]\n\nTeleportacia.org became an ambiguous experiment on the notion of originality in the age of extreme digital reproduction and [[remix culture]]. The guarantee of originality protected by the URL was quickly challenged by the 0100101110101101.org collective, who, under the pseudonym of [[Luther Blissett]], cloned the content and produced an unauthorized [[mirror]]-site, showing the net.art works in the same context and the same quality as the original.

The user is not exploring one art website that has its own meaning and [[aesthetic]] significance within itself, but rather they are exposed to the entire network as a collection of socioeconomic forces and political stances that are not always visible.\n\nRachel Greene has associated net.art with [[tactical media]] as a form of [[Detournement]]. Greene writes: \"The subversion of corporate websites shares a blurry border with hacking and agitprop practices that would become an important field of net art, often referred to as 'tactical media'.\"<ref name=\"Greene\"/>\n\n== Hacker culture ==\nThe Jodi collective works with the aesthetics of computer errors, which has a lot in common, on both the aesthetic and pragmatic levels, with [[hacker culture]]. Questioning and disturbing the browsing experience with hacks, code tricks, faux-code, and faux-virus, critically investigates the context in which they are agents. In turn, the digital environment becomes concerned with its own internal structure. The collective [[0100101110101101.org]] expands the idea of \"art hacktivism\" by performing code interventions and perturbations in art festivals such as the [[Venice Biennale]]. On the other hand, the collective irational.org expands the idea of \"art hacktivism\" by performing interventions and perturbations in the real world, acting on it as on a possible ground for social reengineering.\n\n\"We can point to a superficial difference between most net.art and hacking: hackers have an obsession with getting inside other computer systems and having an agency there, whereas the 404 errors in the JTDDS (for example) only engage other systems in an intentionally wrong manner in order to store a 'secret' message in their error logs. It's nice to think of artists as hackers who endeavour to get inside cultural systems and make them do things they were never intended to do: artists as culture hackers.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thing.net/eyebeam/msg00527.html|title=<eyebeam><blast> 404|date=1998-05-01|publisher=thing.net|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Critique of the art world ==\n\nDuring the heyday of net.art developments, particularly during the rise of global [[Dot-com bubble|dot.com]] capitalism, the first series of critical columns appeared in German and English in the online publication [[Telepolis]]. Edited by writer and artist [[Armin Medosch]], the work published at Telepolis featured American artist and net theorist Mark Amerika's \"Amerika Online\" columns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/ame.html|title=Amerika Online|publisher=Telepolis|accessdate=2009-03-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504081712/http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/ame.html|archivedate=2009-05-04}}</ref> These columns satirized the way self-effacing net.artists (himself included) took themselves too seriously. In response, European net.artists impersonated Amerika in faux emails to deconstruct his demystification of the marketing schemes most net.artists employed to achieve art world legitimacy. It was suggested that \"the duplicitous dispatches were meant to raise US awareness of electronic artists in Europe, and may even contain an element of jealousy.\"<ref>Mirapaul, M [http://cramer.plaintext.cc:70/personal_archives/codework/7-11/7-11.mbox%7C/MBOX-MESSAGE/1628 War of the Words: Ersatz E-Mail Tilts at Art], ''New York Times''</ref>\n\nMany of these net.art interventions also tackled the issue of art as business and investigated mainstream cultural institutions such as the [[Tate Modern]]. Harwood,  a member of the Mongrel collective, in his work ''Uncomfortable Proximity''<ref>[http://www2.tate.org.uk/netart/mongrel/home/default.htm Uncomfortable Proximity]</ref> (the first on-line project commissioned by Tate) mirrors the Tate's own website, and offers new images and ideas, collaged from his own experiences, his readings of Tate works, and publicity materials that inform his interest in the [[Tate]] website{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.\n\nnet.artists have actively participated in the debate over the definition of net.art within the context of the art market. net.art promoted the [[modernist]] idea of the work of art as a ''process'', as opposed to a conception of art as object making {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  [[Alexander R. Galloway]], in an e-flux article entitled \"Jodi's Infrastructure\" argues that Jodi's approach to net.art, which involves the very structures that govern coding,  is uniquely modernist: the form and content converge in the artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/|title=Jodi\u2019s Infrastructure - Journal #74 June 2016 - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>   The presentation of this process within the art world\u2014whether it should be sold in the market, or shown in the institutional art environment, is problematic for digital works {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} created for the [[Internet]].

Each piece of net.art has its originality protected by a guarantee constituted by its [[URL]], which acts as a barrier against reproducibility and/or forgery. Lialina claimed that this allowed the buyer of the piece to own it as they wished: controlling the location address as a means of controlling access to the piece.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This attempt at giving net.art an economic identity and a legitimation within the art world was questioned even within the net.art sphere, though the project was often understood as a [[satire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors3/drfuturetext.html|title=Net Art Market: What Happens Next?|last=Wright|first=Richard|date=1998-08-25|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Teo Spiller]] really sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum in May 1999, calling the whole project of selling the net.art.trade.<ref>Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html \"There May Be Money in Internet Art After All\"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''</ref>[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]] [[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art) 2.jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]\n\nTeleportacia.org became an ambiguous experiment on the notion of originality in the age of extreme digital reproduction and [[remix culture]]. The guarantee of originality protected by the URL was quickly challenged by the 0100101110101101.org collective, who, under the pseudonym of [[Luther Blissett]], cloned the content and produced an unauthorized [[mirror]]-site, showing the net.art works in the same context and the same quality as the original.
