It is a resource for informal science education in the Rocky Mountain region. A variety of exhibitions, programs, and activities help museum visitors learn about the natural history of Colorado, Earth, and the universe. The {{Convert|716,000|sqft|0|adj=on}} building houses more than one million objects in its collections including natural history and anthropological materials, as well as archival and library resources.\n\nThe museum is an independent, [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] institution with approximately 350 full-time and part-time staff, more than 1,800 volunteers, and a 25-member board of trustees. It is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]]<ref name=\"aam_list\"/> and is a [[Smithsonian Affiliations|Smithsonian Institution affiliate]].\n\n==Education programs==\n[[File:Construction Crew Unearths Ice Age Fossils.ogv|thumb|[[VOA]] report about the museum]] \nThe museum provides programming in six main areas. The exhibitions, IMAX films, lectures, classes, and programs pertain to one or more of the following core competencies: anthropology, geology, health science, paleontology, space science, and zoology. More than 300,000 students and teachers visit the museum with school groups each year. In addition, the museum has science outreach programs and distance\u2013learning opportunities for families, schools and surrounding communities. The museum also offers ongoing professional training workshops for teachers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carter Museum-02.jpg|thumb|[[Edwin Carter]] Log Cabin Naturalist Museum ({{Circa}} 1875), [[Breckenridge, Colorado]]]]\nIn 1868, Edwin Carter moved into a tiny cabin in Breckenridge, Colorado, to pursue his passion, the scientific study of the birds and mammals of the Rocky Mountains. Almost single-handedly, Carter assembled one of the most complete collections of Colorado fauna then in existence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=GAD19000216.2.12&srpos=1&e=-------en-20-GAD-1--txt-txIN-carter%27s+life+work-------0-# |title=Carter's Life Work |date=February 16, 1900 |newspaper=Grit-Advocate |publisher=Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection |accessdate=August 13, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWord of Carter's collection spread and, in 1892, a group of prominent Denver citizens declared their interest in moving his collection to the capital city for all to see. Carter offered to sell the entire collection for $10,000. The founders also secured a collection of butterflies and moths, and a collection of crystallized gold.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=FPF18920602.2.12&dliv=none&e=02-06-1892-02-06-1892--en-20-FPF-1--txt-txIN-carter-------0-|title=Fairplay Flume, 1892 |date=June 2, 1892 |newspaper=Fairplay Flume |publisher=Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection |accessdate=August 13, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nTogether, these three collections formed the nucleus of what would become the Colorado Museum of Natural History, officially incorporated on December 6, 1900. After years of preparation and construction, the Colorado Museum of Natural History finally opened to the public on July 1, 1908.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=RCR19080710.2.21&srpos=1&dliv=none&e=-------en-20-RCR-1--txt-txIN-dedication+of+state+museum-------0-|title=Dedication of state museum |date=July 10, 1908 |newspaper=\nRoutt County Republican|publisher=Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection |accessdate=August 13, 2016 }}</ref> John Campion, the first president of the board, said in his dedication address, \"A museum of natural history is never finished\". The first director was hired and quickly recruited staff to build more exhibits and create public programs. By 1918, another wing had opened and research efforts were well underway.\n\nIn 1927, a team led by the Colorado Museum discovered two stone projectile points embedded in an extinct species of bison, in Folsom, New Mexico.

The exhibitions, IMAX films, lectures, classes, and programs pertain to one or more of the following core competencies: anthropology, geology, health science, paleontology, space science, and zoology. More than 300,000 students and teachers visit the museum with school groups each year. In addition, the museum has science outreach programs and distance\u2013learning opportunities for families, schools and surrounding communities. The museum also offers ongoing professional training workshops for teachers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carter Museum-02.jpg|thumb|[[Edwin Carter]] Log Cabin Naturalist Museum ({{Circa}} 1875), [[Breckenridge, Colorado]]]]\nIn 1868, Edwin Carter moved into a tiny cabin in Breckenridge, Colorado, to pursue his passion, the scientific study of the birds and mammals of the Rocky Mountains.

Carter offered to sell the entire collection for $10,000. The founders also secured a collection of butterflies and moths, and a collection of crystallized gold.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=FPF18920602.2.12&dliv=none&e=02-06-1892-02-06-1892--en-20-FPF-1--txt-txIN-carter-------0-|title=Fairplay Flume, 1892 |date=June 2, 1892 |newspaper=Fairplay Flume |publisher=Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection |accessdate=August 13, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nTogether, these three collections formed the nucleus of what would become the Colorado Museum of Natural History, officially incorporated on December 6, 1900.

The department also curates collections from Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Additional holdings include the 800-piece Ethnological Art Collection, and archival photographs and documents. The department is fully committed to compliance with the 1990 [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) and all other national and international laws that impact anthropological objects.\n* Earth Sciences Collection consists of six main groups: vertebrate paleontology, paleobotany, invertebrate paleontology, minerals, meteorites, and micromount.\n* Health Sciences Collection is composed of rare and unique human anatomy specimens, as well as a small selection of pieces of medical importance.\n* Space Sciences Lab is responsible for the museum's Scientific Instruments Collection. This collection is composed of instruments that have been used by museum staff members or are excellent type-examples of particular instruments.
