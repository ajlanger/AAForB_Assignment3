The presence or absence of rhoticity is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of English can be classified. In '''rhotic varieties''', the historical English {{IPA|/r/}} sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts.

This phenomenon is referred to as \"[[Linking and intrusive R|linking R]]\". Many non-rhotic speakers also insert an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} between vowels when the first vowel is one that can occur before syllable-final ''r'' (''drawring'' for ''drawing''). This so-called \"[[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]]\" has been stigmatized, but nowadays many speakers of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) frequently \"intrude\" an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} at word boundaries, especially where one or both vowels is [[schwa]]; for example ''the idea of it'' becomes ''the idea-r-of it'', ''Australia and New Zealand'' becomes ''Australia-r-and New Zealand'', the formerly well-known [[India Office|''India-r-Office'']] and \"Laura Norder\" (Law and Order). The typical alternative used by RP speakers (and some rhotic speakers as well) is to insert a [[glottal stop]] where an intrusive R would otherwise be placed.<ref>Wells, ''Accents of English'', 1:224-225.</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Gimson|first=Alfred Charles|editor-last=Cruttenden|editor-first=Alan|year=2014|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|pages=119\u2013120|publisher=Routledge|edition=8th|isbn=978-1-4441-8309-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2nMAgAAQBAJ\n}}</ref>\n\nFor non-rhotic speakers, what was historically a vowel plus {{IPA|/r/}} is now usually realized as a [[long vowel]]. This is called [[compensatory lengthening]], lengthening that occurs after the elision of a sound. So in RP and many other non-rhotic accents ''card, fern, born'' are pronounced {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0d]}}, {{IPA|[f\u025c\u02d0n]}}, {{IPA|[b\u0254\u02d0n]}} or similar (actual pronunciations vary from accent to accent). This length may be retained in phrases, so while ''car'' pronounced in isolation is {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0]}}, ''car owner'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0r\u0259\u028an\u0259]}}. But a final schwa usually remains short, so ''water'' in isolation is {{IPA|[w\u0254\u02d0t\u0259]}}. In RP and similar accents the vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (or {{IPA|/\u028a/}}), when followed by ''r'', become [[diphthong]]s ending in schwa, so ''near'' is {{IPA|[n\u026a\u0259]}} and ''poor'' is {{IPA|[p\u028a\u0259]}}, though these have other realizations as well, including monophthongal ones; once again, the pronunciations vary from accent to accent. The same happens to [[diphthong]]s followed by R, though these may be considered to end in {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} in rhotic speech, and it is the {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} that reduces to schwa as usual in non-rhotic speech: ''tire'' said in isolation is {{IPA|[ta\u026a\u0259]}} and ''sour'' is {{IPA|[sa\u028a\u0259]}}.<ref>''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>  For some speakers, some long vowels alternate with a [[diphthong]] ending in schwa, so ''wear'' may be {{IPA|[w\u025b\u0259]}} but ''wearing''  {{IPA|[\u02c8w\u025b\u02d0\u0279\u026a\u014b]}}.\n\nEven General American speakers commonly drop the {{IPA|/r/}} in non-final unstressed syllables when another syllable in the same word also contains {{IPA|/r/}}; this may be referred to as ''R-dissimilation''. Examples include the dropping of the first {{IPA|/r/}} in the words ''surprise'', ''governor'' and ''caterpillar''.

In the case of the Philippines, this may be explained because the [[Philippine English|English]] that is spoken there is heavily influenced by the American dialect. In addition, many East Asians (in Mainland China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) who have a good command of English generally have rhotic accents because of the influence of [[American English]]. This excludes [[Hong Kong]], whose RP English dialect is a result of its almost 150-year-history as a British Crown colony (later British dependent territory). The lack of consonant /r/ in Cantonese also contributes to the phenomenon (although rhoticity started to exist due to the handover in 1997 and influence by US and East Asian entertainment industry). However, many older (and younger) speakers among South and East Asians speak non-rhotic.\n\nOther Asian regions with non-rhotic English are Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Mehmet|last1=Demirezen|year=2012|title= Which /r/ are you using as an English teacher? rhotic or non-rhotic?|url=https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/277811/1-s2.0-S1877042812X0017X/1-s2.0-S1877042812016710/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEB0aCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIGLPfrckiP6JfY8%2F%2Fe2vzr1MwFPRyGZkn2yAaDs7%2BVAuAiEAl7RsBD22HGiOPAfx91Re2uEydfUT2pygLt7WCw89QaIq0AIIdhACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDJw1CKFf0EJGm3uuTCqtAjtO2VgEetQnP%2FtEoBjaPqtP44HzjXLKSgwTexfhXpJRN4issG9aLCZJJou3RUivP8EBgd89TL98KnXnK3ljYnRavPHVrStcqKTdmA6K5hC806kkigumNf8D7v391mGbP75e6rFX0HM27wwCQt8sFzR5OguTqBHfG%2BaJRIOSqaMZdsn8UQCCzwjfGdyheIzJ18QDF4Sz2hWBsxHgXHLVqf%2BSpaMifPPsvudGGLDBra31EkpFI40P0er32pIoZVWFMrPLJXrqiRIjuwdzRoNwoKaCDo0fLzz5rA6JqEuZCjbDi5oL4xe2WO6p%2Fp9ljZwJv%2B%2B7p5ooHaeZwQvj6d0rktk%2Bg8EKqzorApQnxL5E%2BreUVtiGtGRRdlX6abz3fAen%2Fksz2VDxJTM%2B%2FvRJs70w8PHd7wU6zwJ3yHV7bRNCy6NT4wTIoxaTfn02PWfTiTGF20p67yqjnaaN52Rn5dsrTiDKoUs8D2C7PJl4wLM5p0lnqQPiYL%2FxhKCrMsDKNL9mOf6N6dWssH0kKJHLTP7TxANyV0DNqBVVuyCFeMxTbY6PQh4JU%2FoXXb2mE40TSh9bz6RVQnqkwWQ4WYnz1dHje%2FKdmUX8SAGoZ8%2FbIvOTuAL%2FNMQ3peuxGItuR9bdcxM4V9lHyocFFfvNAB5D65tnQFUQgjji9aRF14DWYF45L9Yxo5KSImAvW%2FX8v4zUjjmfLFpWgeSv11x%2FyxdiHUIJ5ezNvoqg07fXQatNMlwMjWBKAwFfZkbPplBC4AMD8ZsTDQOCuyMZhsCnjGxBFw6eR%2Fls1rgmfPdRBTJQhobAwLYyVa5bA0DBq6p7ctyHq8EFRiNcNhPbhaDJ9EJj88Py4OF2wQhRIQ%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20191216T133057Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY7RXQQVVV%2F20191216%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=bbb45797896ef9114665520f1348e5fb7b276910b62cb38400497407cfcd18ba&hash=f0c45400446ad742aa106eef3b931c6a56fbb631e1154a01b58fbe56aa55d78b&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877042812016710&tid=spdf-7313d5f7-c9d2-4a04-a6df-b2dc0a1b6cc4&sid=a7c2684792d533422428cee211468d64af78gxrqa|work=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|pages=2659\u20132663|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.542|ISSN=1877-0428|OCLC=931520939}}</ref> A typical Malaysian's English would be almost totally non-rhotic due to the nonexistence of rhotic endings in both languages of influence, whereas a more educated Malaysian's English may be non-rhotic due to Standard Malaysian English being based on RP ([[Received Pronunciation]]). The classical English spoken in Brunei is non-rhotic. But one current change that seems to be taking place is that Brunei English is becoming rhotic, partly influenced by American English and partly influenced by the rhoticity of Standard Malay, also influenced by languages of [[Indians in Brunei]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) (rhoticity is also used by [[ethnic Chinese in Brunei|Chinese Bruneians]]), although English in neighboring Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia remains non-rhotic; rhoticity in Brunei English is equal to Philippine and Indian dialects of English and Scottish and Irish dialects. Non-rhoticity is mostly found in older generations, its phenomenon is almost similar to the status of American English, wherein non-rhoticity reduced greatly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Salbrina | first1 = S. | last2 = Deterding | first2 = D. | year = 2010 | title = Rhoticity in Brunei English | url = | journal = English World-Wide | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 121\u2013137 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Nur Raihan Mohamad|year=2017|title=Rhoticity in Brunei English : A diachronic approach|url=http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/SEA/volume17.html|work=Southeast Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal|volume=17|pages=1-7}}</ref>\n\nA typical teenager's Southeast Asian English would be rhotic<ref name=\"gupta92\">{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|last2=Hiang|first1=Anthea F.|first2=Tan Chor|work=York Papers in Linguistics|date=January 1992|url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthea_Gupta/publication/234677933_Post-Vocalic_r_in_Singapore_English/links/5884041ea6fdcc6b7910881e/Post-Vocalic-r-in-Singapore-English.pdf|volume=16|title=Post-Vocalic /r/ in Singapore English|pages=139\u2013152|ISSN=0307-3238|OCLC=2199758}}</ref>, mainly because of prominent influence by American English<ref name=\"gupta92\" />.

[[Sri Lankan English]] may be rhotic.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nThe English spoken in most of Africa is based on RP and is generally non-rhotic. Pronunciation and variation in African English accents are largely affected by native African language influences, level of education and exposure to Western influences. The English accents spoken in the coastal areas of West Africa are primarily non-rhotic as are the underlying varieties of Niger-Congo languages spoken in that part of West Africa. Rhoticity may be present in English spoken in areas where rhotic Afro-Asiatic or Nilo Saharan languages are spoken across northern West Africa and in the Nilotic regions of East Africa. More modern trends show an increasing American influence on African English pronunciation particularly among younger urban affluent populations, where the American rhotic 'r' may be over-stressed in informal communication to create a pseudo-Americanised accent. By and large official spoken English used in post colonial African countries is non-rhotic. Standard [[Liberian English]] is also non-rhotic because liquids are lost at the end of words or before consonants.<ref>Brinton, Lauren and Leslie Arnovick. ''The English Language: A Linguistic History''. Oxford University Press: Canada, 2006</ref> South African English is mostly [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], especially Cultivated dialect based on RP, except for some Broad varieties spoken in the [[Cape Province]] (typically in -''er'' suffixes, as in ''writ'''er'''''). It appears that postvocalic {{IPA|/r/}} is entering the speech of younger people under the influence of [[American English]], and maybe an influence of Scottish dialect brought by Scottish settlers.{{sfnp|Bowerman|2004|p=940}}{{sfnp|Lass|2002|p=121}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nStandard [[Australian English]] is non-rhotic. A degree of rhoticity has been observed in a particular sublect of [[Australian Aboriginal English]] spoken on the coast of [[South Australia]], especially in speakers from the [[Point Pearce]] and [[Raukkan]] settlements. These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 but only within [[word stem|stems]]. For example: [bo\u02d0\u0279d] \"board\", [t\u0283\u025c\u0279t\u0283] \"church\", [p\u025c\u0279\u03b8] \"Perth\"; but [fl\u00e6\u02d0] \"flour\", [d\u0252kt\u0259] \"doctor\", [j\u026a\u0259z] \"years\". It has been speculated that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia \u2013 including [[Cornish English|Cornish]] tin-miners, [[Scottish English|Scottish]] missionaries, and [[American English|American]] whalers \u2013 spoke rhotic varieties.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Postvocalic R in an Australian English dialect|first=Peter|last=Sutton|year=1989|volume=9|issue=1|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics}}</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nAlthough New Zealand English is predominantly non-rhotic, [[Southland Region|Southland]] and parts of [[Otago]] in the far south of New Zealand's [[South Island]] are rhotic from apparent Scottish influence.<ref>Clark, L., \"[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=11763319 Southland dialect study to shed light on language evolution],\" ''[[New Zealand Herald]], 9 Dec 2016.

This up-gliding variant historically occurred in some non-rhotic dialects of [[American English]] and is particularly associated with the early twentieth-century (but now extinct or moribund) dialects of [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]],<ref>{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}</ref> likely developing in the prior century. In fact, in speakers born before [[World War I]], this sound apparently predominated throughout [[Older Southern American English|older speech of the Southern United States]], ranging from \"South Carolina to Texas and north to eastern Arkansas and the southern edge of Kentucky.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomas|2006|p=8}}</ref> This variant happened only before a consonant, so, for example, ''stir'' was never {{IPA|[st\u0259\u026a]}};<ref>{{harvp|Wells|1982|pp=508 ff}}</ref> rather ''stir'' would have been pronounced {{IPA|[st\u025c(r)]}}.\n\n=== Coil\u2013curl merger ===\nIn some cases, particularly in New York City, the {{sc2|NURSE}} sound gliding from a schwa upwards even led to a [[phonemic merger]] of the vowel classes associated with the [[General American]] phonemes {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} as in {{sc2|CHOICE}} with the {{IPA|/\u025cr/}} of {{sc2|NURSE}}; thus, words like ''coil'' and ''curl'', as well as ''voice'' and ''verse'', were homophones. The merged vowel was typically a diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259\u026a]}}, with a mid central starting point, rather than the back rounded starting point of {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} of {{sc2|CHOICE}} in most other accents of English. The merger is responsible for the \"Brooklynese\" stereotypes of ''bird'' sounding like ''boid'' and ''thirty-third'' sounding like ''toity-toid''. This merger is known for the word ''soitanly'', used often by the [[Three Stooges]] comedian [[Curly Howard]] as a variant of ''certainly'' in comedy [[short subject|shorts]] of the 1930s and 1940s. The songwriter [[Sam M. Lewis]], a native New Yorker, rhymed ''returning'' with ''joining'' in the lyrics of the English-language version of ''[[Gloomy Sunday]]''.

Examples include:\n* ''Er'', used in non-rhotic dialects to indicate a [[filled pause]], which most rhotic dialects would instead convey with ''uh'' or ''eh''.\n* The game [[Parcheesi]], from Indian [[Pachisi]].\n* British English slang words:\n** ''char'' for ''cha'' from the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation of {{zh|t=\u8336}} (= \"[[tea]]\" (the drink)){{Citation needed|reason=Please prove that 'char' isn't an adoption of the Gwoyeu Romatzyh spelling 'char' for \u8336 (where '-r' signals a syllable in the second tone the same way the acute accent of Pinyin 'ch\u00e1' does)|date=June 2018}}\n* In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s books:\n** ''dorg'' instead of ''dawg'' for a [[drawl]]ed pronunciation of ''dog''.\n** Hindu god name [[Kamadeva|Kama]] misspelled as ''[[Karma]]'' (which is a concept in several Asian religions, not a god).\n** [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] {{wikt-lang|hi|\u0915\u093e\u0917\u093c\u091c\u093c}} / {{nq|{{wikt-lang|ur|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630}}}} ''{{transl|ur|IAST|k\u0101ghaz}}'' (\"paper\") spelled as ''kargaz''.\n* The donkey [[Eeyore]] in [[A.A. Milne]]'s stories, whose name comes from the sound that donkeys make, commonly spelled ''hee-haw'' in American English.\n* ''Burma'' and ''Myanmar'' for [[Burmese language|Burmese]] {{IPA|[b\u0259m\u00e0]}} and {{IPA|[mj\u00e0mm\u00e0]}}.\n* Transliteration of Cantonese words and names, such as ''[[char siu]]'' ({{zh|t=\u53c9\u71d2|j=caa\u00b9 siu\u00b9}}) and [[Wong Kar-wai]] ({{zh|t=\u738b\u5bb6\u885e|j=Wong\u2074 Gaa1wai\u2076}})\n* The spelling of ''schoolmarm'' for ''school ma'am'', which Americans pronounce with the rhotic consonant. (It should, however, be pointed out that this particular term is not used in modern American English. It harkens back to a time when one teacher taught all grades in a rural district and was used to refer to that person in a polite formal way by the community.)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume VI: English in North America |last= Fisher |first= John Hurt |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |editor-last= Algeo |editor-first = John |location= Cambridge | pages = 59\u201385 |chapter= British and American, Continuity and Divergence |quote=| ref = harv | isbn = 0-521-26479-0 |via=| authorlink=John Hurt Fisher }}\n*{{cite journal\n |last=Gick \n |first=Bryan \n |year=1999 \n |title=A gesture-based account of intrusive consonants in English \n |journal=Phonology \n |volume=16 \n |issue=1 \n |pages=29\u201354 \n |url=http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |ref=harv \n |doi=10.1017/s0952675799003693 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412043850/http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-04-12 \n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Kurath\n|first=H.\n|year=1964\n|title=A Phonology and Prosody of Modern English\n|place=Heidelberg\n|publisher=Carl Winter\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | title=The Atlas of North American English | last2=Ash | first2=Sharon | last3=Boberg | first3=Charles | publisher=Mouton de Gruyter | year=2006 | isbn=3-11-016746-8| location=Berlin |pages=|quote=|via=|first1=William | last1=Labov | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book| title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476\u20131776 | last=Lass | first=Roger | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-26476-6| editor-last=Lass | editor-first=Roger | location=Cambridge | pages=56\u2013186 | chapter=Phonology and Morphology |quote=|ref=harv |via=}}\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm|title=Phonological Features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE)|last=Pollock, Bailey, Berni, Fletcher, Hinton, Johnson, Roberts, & Weaver|first=|date=17 March 2001|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}\n* {{cite book | title=Language in the British Isles | last=Trudgill | first=Peter | publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1984 |isbn=| location=Cambridge |pages=|quote=|via=| authorlink=Peter Trudgill }}\n* {{cite book | title=Accents of English |last=Wells |first=J.

The English actor and linguist [[John Walker (lexicographer)|John Walker]] used the spelling ''ar'' to indicate the long vowel of ''aunt'' in his 1775 rhyming dictionary.<ref name=\"Labov, Ash, and Boberg 2006: 47\"/> In his influential ''Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Expositor of the English Language'' (1791), Walker reported, with a strong tone of disapproval, that \"... the ''r'' in ''lard'', ''bard'', [...] is pronounced so much in the throat as to be little more than the middle or Italian ''a'', lengthened into ''baa'', ''baad''....\"{{sfnp|Lass|1999|p=115}} Americans returning to England after the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1783 reported surprise at the significant changes in fashionable pronunciation.{{sfnp|Fisher|2001|p=73}}  \n\nBy the early 19th century, the southern British standard was fully transformed into a non-rhotic variety, though it continued to be variable as late as the 1870s.{{sfnp|Lass|1999|p=115}} The extent of rhoticity across England in the mid-19th century is summarized as widespread in the book ''New Zealand English: its Origins and Evolution'':\n:[T]he only areas of England ... for which we have ''no'' evidence of rhoticity in the mid-nineteenth century lie in two separate corridors.

This phenomenon is referred to as \"[[Linking and intrusive R|linking R]]\". Many non-rhotic speakers also insert an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} between vowels when the first vowel is one that can occur before syllable-final ''r'' (''drawring'' for ''drawing''). This so-called \"[[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]]\" has been stigmatized, but nowadays many speakers of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) frequently \"intrude\" an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} at word boundaries, especially where one or both vowels is [[schwa]]; for example ''the idea of it'' becomes ''the idea-r-of it'', ''Australia and New Zealand'' becomes ''Australia-r-and New Zealand'', the formerly well-known [[India Office|''India-r-Office'']] and \"Laura Norder\" (Law and Order). The typical alternative used by RP speakers (and some rhotic speakers as well) is to insert a [[glottal stop]] where an intrusive R would otherwise be placed.<ref>Wells, ''Accents of English'', 1:224-225.</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Gimson|first=Alfred Charles|editor-last=Cruttenden|editor-first=Alan|year=2014|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|pages=119\u2013120|publisher=Routledge|edition=8th|isbn=978-1-4441-8309-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2nMAgAAQBAJ\n}}</ref>\n\nFor non-rhotic speakers, what was historically a vowel plus {{IPA|/r/}} is now usually realized as a [[long vowel]]. This is called [[compensatory lengthening]], lengthening that occurs after the elision of a sound. So in RP and many other non-rhotic accents ''card, fern, born'' are pronounced {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0d]}}, {{IPA|[f\u025c\u02d0n]}}, {{IPA|[b\u0254\u02d0n]}} or similar (actual pronunciations vary from accent to accent). This length may be retained in phrases, so while ''car'' pronounced in isolation is {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0]}}, ''car owner'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0r\u0259\u028an\u0259]}}. But a final schwa usually remains short, so ''water'' in isolation is {{IPA|[w\u0254\u02d0t\u0259]}}. In RP and similar accents the vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (or {{IPA|/\u028a/}}), when followed by ''r'', become [[diphthong]]s ending in schwa, so ''near'' is {{IPA|[n\u026a\u0259]}} and ''poor'' is {{IPA|[p\u028a\u0259]}}, though these have other realizations as well, including monophthongal ones; once again, the pronunciations vary from accent to accent. The same happens to [[diphthong]]s followed by R, though these may be considered to end in {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} in rhotic speech, and it is the {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} that reduces to schwa as usual in non-rhotic speech: ''tire'' said in isolation is {{IPA|[ta\u026a\u0259]}} and ''sour'' is {{IPA|[sa\u028a\u0259]}}.<ref>''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>  For some speakers, some long vowels alternate with a [[diphthong]] ending in schwa, so ''wear'' may be {{IPA|[w\u025b\u0259]}} but ''wearing''  {{IPA|[\u02c8w\u025b\u02d0\u0279\u026a\u014b]}}.\n\nEven General American speakers commonly drop the {{IPA|/r/}} in non-final unstressed syllables when another syllable in the same word also contains {{IPA|/r/}}; this may be referred to as ''R-dissimilation''. Examples include the dropping of the first {{IPA|/r/}} in the words ''surprise'', ''governor'' and ''caterpillar''.

Many varieties of [[Indian English]] are rhotic owing to the underlying [[phonotactics]] of the native [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] languages<ref name=\"wells\" /> whilst some tend to be non-rhotic. In the case of the Philippines, this may be explained because the [[Philippine English|English]] that is spoken there is heavily influenced by the American dialect. In addition, many East Asians (in Mainland China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) who have a good command of English generally have rhotic accents because of the influence of [[American English]]. This excludes [[Hong Kong]], whose RP English dialect is a result of its almost 150-year-history as a British Crown colony (later British dependent territory). The lack of consonant /r/ in Cantonese also contributes to the phenomenon (although rhoticity started to exist due to the handover in 1997 and influence by US and East Asian entertainment industry). However, many older (and younger) speakers among South and East Asians speak non-rhotic.\n\nOther Asian regions with non-rhotic English are Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Mehmet|last1=Demirezen|year=2012|title= Which /r/ are you using as an English teacher? rhotic or non-rhotic?|url=https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/277811/1-s2.0-S1877042812X0017X/1-s2.0-S1877042812016710/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEB0aCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIGLPfrckiP6JfY8%2F%2Fe2vzr1MwFPRyGZkn2yAaDs7%2BVAuAiEAl7RsBD22HGiOPAfx91Re2uEydfUT2pygLt7WCw89QaIq0AIIdhACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDJw1CKFf0EJGm3uuTCqtAjtO2VgEetQnP%2FtEoBjaPqtP44HzjXLKSgwTexfhXpJRN4issG9aLCZJJou3RUivP8EBgd89TL98KnXnK3ljYnRavPHVrStcqKTdmA6K5hC806kkigumNf8D7v391mGbP75e6rFX0HM27wwCQt8sFzR5OguTqBHfG%2BaJRIOSqaMZdsn8UQCCzwjfGdyheIzJ18QDF4Sz2hWBsxHgXHLVqf%2BSpaMifPPsvudGGLDBra31EkpFI40P0er32pIoZVWFMrPLJXrqiRIjuwdzRoNwoKaCDo0fLzz5rA6JqEuZCjbDi5oL4xe2WO6p%2Fp9ljZwJv%2B%2B7p5ooHaeZwQvj6d0rktk%2Bg8EKqzorApQnxL5E%2BreUVtiGtGRRdlX6abz3fAen%2Fksz2VDxJTM%2B%2FvRJs70w8PHd7wU6zwJ3yHV7bRNCy6NT4wTIoxaTfn02PWfTiTGF20p67yqjnaaN52Rn5dsrTiDKoUs8D2C7PJl4wLM5p0lnqQPiYL%2FxhKCrMsDKNL9mOf6N6dWssH0kKJHLTP7TxANyV0DNqBVVuyCFeMxTbY6PQh4JU%2FoXXb2mE40TSh9bz6RVQnqkwWQ4WYnz1dHje%2FKdmUX8SAGoZ8%2FbIvOTuAL%2FNMQ3peuxGItuR9bdcxM4V9lHyocFFfvNAB5D65tnQFUQgjji9aRF14DWYF45L9Yxo5KSImAvW%2FX8v4zUjjmfLFpWgeSv11x%2FyxdiHUIJ5ezNvoqg07fXQatNMlwMjWBKAwFfZkbPplBC4AMD8ZsTDQOCuyMZhsCnjGxBFw6eR%2Fls1rgmfPdRBTJQhobAwLYyVa5bA0DBq6p7ctyHq8EFRiNcNhPbhaDJ9EJj88Py4OF2wQhRIQ%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20191216T133057Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY7RXQQVVV%2F20191216%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=bbb45797896ef9114665520f1348e5fb7b276910b62cb38400497407cfcd18ba&hash=f0c45400446ad742aa106eef3b931c6a56fbb631e1154a01b58fbe56aa55d78b&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877042812016710&tid=spdf-7313d5f7-c9d2-4a04-a6df-b2dc0a1b6cc4&sid=a7c2684792d533422428cee211468d64af78gxrqa|work=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|pages=2659\u20132663|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.542|ISSN=1877-0428|OCLC=931520939}}</ref> A typical Malaysian's English would be almost totally non-rhotic due to the nonexistence of rhotic endings in both languages of influence, whereas a more educated Malaysian's English may be non-rhotic due to Standard Malaysian English being based on RP ([[Received Pronunciation]]). The classical English spoken in Brunei is non-rhotic. But one current change that seems to be taking place is that Brunei English is becoming rhotic, partly influenced by American English and partly influenced by the rhoticity of Standard Malay, also influenced by languages of [[Indians in Brunei]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) (rhoticity is also used by [[ethnic Chinese in Brunei|Chinese Bruneians]]), although English in neighboring Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia remains non-rhotic; rhoticity in Brunei English is equal to Philippine and Indian dialects of English and Scottish and Irish dialects.

Pronunciation and variation in African English accents are largely affected by native African language influences, level of education and exposure to Western influences. The English accents spoken in the coastal areas of West Africa are primarily non-rhotic as are the underlying varieties of Niger-Congo languages spoken in that part of West Africa. Rhoticity may be present in English spoken in areas where rhotic Afro-Asiatic or Nilo Saharan languages are spoken across northern West Africa and in the Nilotic regions of East Africa. More modern trends show an increasing American influence on African English pronunciation particularly among younger urban affluent populations, where the American rhotic 'r' may be over-stressed in informal communication to create a pseudo-Americanised accent. By and large official spoken English used in post colonial African countries is non-rhotic. Standard [[Liberian English]] is also non-rhotic because liquids are lost at the end of words or before consonants.<ref>Brinton, Lauren and Leslie Arnovick. ''The English Language: A Linguistic History''. Oxford University Press: Canada, 2006</ref> South African English is mostly [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], especially Cultivated dialect based on RP, except for some Broad varieties spoken in the [[Cape Province]] (typically in -''er'' suffixes, as in ''writ'''er'''''). It appears that postvocalic {{IPA|/r/}} is entering the speech of younger people under the influence of [[American English]], and maybe an influence of Scottish dialect brought by Scottish settlers.{{sfnp|Bowerman|2004|p=940}}{{sfnp|Lass|2002|p=121}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nStandard [[Australian English]] is non-rhotic. A degree of rhoticity has been observed in a particular sublect of [[Australian Aboriginal English]] spoken on the coast of [[South Australia]], especially in speakers from the [[Point Pearce]] and [[Raukkan]] settlements. These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 but only within [[word stem|stems]]. For example: [bo\u02d0\u0279d] \"board\", [t\u0283\u025c\u0279t\u0283] \"church\", [p\u025c\u0279\u03b8] \"Perth\"; but [fl\u00e6\u02d0] \"flour\", [d\u0252kt\u0259] \"doctor\", [j\u026a\u0259z] \"years\". It has been speculated that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia \u2013 including [[Cornish English|Cornish]] tin-miners, [[Scottish English|Scottish]] missionaries, and [[American English|American]] whalers \u2013 spoke rhotic varieties.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Postvocalic R in an Australian English dialect|first=Peter|last=Sutton|year=1989|volume=9|issue=1|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics}}</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nAlthough New Zealand English is predominantly non-rhotic, [[Southland Region|Southland]] and parts of [[Otago]] in the far south of New Zealand's [[South Island]] are rhotic from apparent Scottish influence.<ref>Clark, L., \"[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=11763319 Southland dialect study to shed light on language evolution],\" ''[[New Zealand Herald]], 9 Dec 2016.

This up-gliding variant historically occurred in some non-rhotic dialects of [[American English]] and is particularly associated with the early twentieth-century (but now extinct or moribund) dialects of [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]],<ref>{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}</ref> likely developing in the prior century. In fact, in speakers born before [[World War I]], this sound apparently predominated throughout [[Older Southern American English|older speech of the Southern United States]], ranging from \"South Carolina to Texas and north to eastern Arkansas and the southern edge of Kentucky.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomas|2006|p=8}}</ref> This variant happened only before a consonant, so, for example, ''stir'' was never {{IPA|[st\u0259\u026a]}};<ref>{{harvp|Wells|1982|pp=508 ff}}</ref> rather ''stir'' would have been pronounced {{IPA|[st\u025c(r)]}}.\n\n=== Coil\u2013curl merger ===\nIn some cases, particularly in New York City, the {{sc2|NURSE}} sound gliding from a schwa upwards even led to a [[phonemic merger]] of the vowel classes associated with the [[General American]] phonemes {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} as in {{sc2|CHOICE}} with the {{IPA|/\u025cr/}} of {{sc2|NURSE}}; thus, words like ''coil'' and ''curl'', as well as ''voice'' and ''verse'', were homophones. The merged vowel was typically a diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259\u026a]}}, with a mid central starting point, rather than the back rounded starting point of {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} of {{sc2|CHOICE}} in most other accents of English. The merger is responsible for the \"Brooklynese\" stereotypes of ''bird'' sounding like ''boid'' and ''thirty-third'' sounding like ''toity-toid''. This merger is known for the word ''soitanly'', used often by the [[Three Stooges]] comedian [[Curly Howard]] as a variant of ''certainly'' in comedy [[short subject|shorts]] of the 1930s and 1940s. The songwriter [[Sam M. Lewis]], a native New Yorker, rhymed ''returning'' with ''joining'' in the lyrics of the English-language version of ''[[Gloomy Sunday]]''.

In rhotic dialects, [[spelling pronunciation]] has caused these words to be pronounced rhotically anyway. Examples include:\n* ''Er'', used in non-rhotic dialects to indicate a [[filled pause]], which most rhotic dialects would instead convey with ''uh'' or ''eh''.\n* The game [[Parcheesi]], from Indian [[Pachisi]].\n* British English slang words:\n** ''char'' for ''cha'' from the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation of {{zh|t=\u8336}} (= \"[[tea]]\" (the drink)){{Citation needed|reason=Please prove that 'char' isn't an adoption of the Gwoyeu Romatzyh spelling 'char' for \u8336 (where '-r' signals a syllable in the second tone the same way the acute accent of Pinyin 'ch\u00e1' does)|date=June 2018}}\n* In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s books:\n** ''dorg'' instead of ''dawg'' for a [[drawl]]ed pronunciation of ''dog''.\n** Hindu god name [[Kamadeva|Kama]] misspelled as ''[[Karma]]'' (which is a concept in several Asian religions, not a god).\n** [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] {{wikt-lang|hi|\u0915\u093e\u0917\u093c\u091c\u093c}} / {{nq|{{wikt-lang|ur|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630}}}} ''{{transl|ur|IAST|k\u0101ghaz}}'' (\"paper\") spelled as ''kargaz''.\n* The donkey [[Eeyore]] in [[A.A. Milne]]'s stories, whose name comes from the sound that donkeys make, commonly spelled ''hee-haw'' in American English.\n* ''Burma'' and ''Myanmar'' for [[Burmese language|Burmese]] {{IPA|[b\u0259m\u00e0]}} and {{IPA|[mj\u00e0mm\u00e0]}}.\n* Transliteration of Cantonese words and names, such as ''[[char siu]]'' ({{zh|t=\u53c9\u71d2|j=caa\u00b9 siu\u00b9}}) and [[Wong Kar-wai]] ({{zh|t=\u738b\u5bb6\u885e|j=Wong\u2074 Gaa1wai\u2076}})\n* The spelling of ''schoolmarm'' for ''school ma'am'', which Americans pronounce with the rhotic consonant. (It should, however, be pointed out that this particular term is not used in modern American English. It harkens back to a time when one teacher taught all grades in a rural district and was used to refer to that person in a polite formal way by the community.)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume VI: English in North America |last= Fisher |first= John Hurt |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |editor-last= Algeo |editor-first = John |location= Cambridge | pages = 59\u201385 |chapter= British and American, Continuity and Divergence |quote=| ref = harv | isbn = 0-521-26479-0 |via=| authorlink=John Hurt Fisher }}\n*{{cite journal\n |last=Gick \n |first=Bryan \n |year=1999 \n |title=A gesture-based account of intrusive consonants in English \n |journal=Phonology \n |volume=16 \n |issue=1 \n |pages=29\u201354 \n |url=http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |ref=harv \n |doi=10.1017/s0952675799003693 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412043850/http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-04-12 \n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Kurath\n|first=H.\n|year=1964\n|title=A Phonology and Prosody of Modern English\n|place=Heidelberg\n|publisher=Carl Winter\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | title=The Atlas of North American English | last2=Ash | first2=Sharon | last3=Boberg | first3=Charles | publisher=Mouton de Gruyter | year=2006 | isbn=3-11-016746-8| location=Berlin |pages=|quote=|via=|first1=William | last1=Labov | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book| title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476\u20131776 | last=Lass | first=Roger | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-26476-6| editor-last=Lass | editor-first=Roger | location=Cambridge | pages=56\u2013186 | chapter=Phonology and Morphology |quote=|ref=harv |via=}}\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm|title=Phonological Features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE)|last=Pollock, Bailey, Berni, Fletcher, Hinton, Johnson, Roberts, & Weaver|first=|date=17 March 2001|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}\n* {{cite book | title=Language in the British Isles | last=Trudgill | first=Peter | publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1984 |isbn=| location=Cambridge |pages=|quote=|via=| authorlink=Peter Trudgill }}\n* {{cite book | title=Accents of English |last=Wells |first=J.
