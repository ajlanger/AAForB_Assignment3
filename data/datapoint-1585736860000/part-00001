The plant was built and run in partnership with the privately owned [[Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company]] which owned a number of other power plants across the country.  Thanks to state support Eskom was able to buy out the Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company in 1948 for \u00a314.5 million (roughly equivalent to \u00a32.55 billion in 2017).
