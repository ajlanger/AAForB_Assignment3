Throughout the history of the program, nearly 63,000 undergraduate students<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/contact/about-us/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.\n\nDuring the spring and fall semesters, up to 600 undergraduates<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/life-at-sea/our-ship/|title=Our Ship|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Semester at Sea|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> participate in the approximately 100\u2013110-day program. During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, travelling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrolment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or travelling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].\n\nBefore arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

In Fall 2019, Semester at Sea embarked on a new voyage that included ports such as the Netherlands, [[Poland]], the [[Kiel Canal]] Transit, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Croatia]], Morocco, Ghana, [[Brazil]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Panama Canal]] Transit, [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey|website=Semester At Sea|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n \nThe ship docked in [[Denmark]] during Summer 2008,<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Semester at Sea \u2013 Summer 2008 Itinerary/Calendar\n |url         = http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703042836/http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |archivedate = 2008-07-03\n}}</ref> [[Namibia]] during Fall 2008, [[Bulgaria]] during Summer 2009, and [[Senegal]] during Fall 2015, the first time in the history of the program that Semester at Sea had visited these countries.\n\n== Traditions ==\n=== Neptune Day celebration ===\nWhen the ship crosses the equator, the students, faculty and crew of the vessel celebrate [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] Day, a maritime [[line-crossing ceremony]]. Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa. On March 12, 2020, SaS canceled all South Africa programming, concluding the Spring 2020 voyage, and advised all students to return home when docked in Cape Town in light of the U.S. State Departments worldwide travel advisory.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/2020/03/12/spring-2020-voyage-disembarkation-update-3-12-20/|title=Spring 2020 Voyage: Disembarkation Update (3-12-20)|last=|first=|date=March 12, 2020|website=Semester at Sea: News at the Helm|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html?utm_campaign=Spring%202020%20Voyage%20Prep&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=84632711&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8FseLGLlH2Z4VjeJyztMJYfZyTcJv-q8Wtmj6YWsXVsGF7lf93UMVT7FzJnBmvU1K5VDXvl2Rg5KUvGf0TUjEF_TKiuw&_hsmi=84632711|title=Global Level 4 Health Advisory \u2013 Do Not Travel|website=travel.state.gov|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> All students were required to disembark from the MV ''World Odyssey'' by March 16, 1800 local time.

During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, traveling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or traveling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].\n\nBefore arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.
