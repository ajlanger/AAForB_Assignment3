Bennet was first selected to represent his adopted country as part of the [[1891 Home Nations Championship]], brought into the pack to face England in the opening game of the tournament. Bennett was one of three newly capped forwards, joining [[Edward Pegge]] and [[Harry Packer]] in their first international. In a close game, Wales lost 3-7, but the selectors kept faith with Bennett and he was reselected for the next game away to Scotland. Wales lost this game heavily, in a year that saw Scotland eventually win the championship and take the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]]. The selectors reacted to the defeat by switching out half of the pack, replacing them with new caps; Bennett was one of the players to lose his position. Although not picked for the opening match of the [[1892 Home Nations Championship|1892 Championship]], Bennett was back in favour for the last two matches of the series, replacing [[Rowley Thomas]]. Despite the quality in the Welsh team, including their returning captain [[Arthur Gould (rugby player)|Arthur Gould]], the Welsh were again beaten. The final game of the tournament, was a [[Wooden spoon (award)|Wooden Spoon]] decider away to Ireland. Bennett was joined in this game by fellow Harlequins team-mate [[Frederick Nicholls]], who played on the wing.
