What happened to [[Matthew Shepard]] is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.</blockquote>\n\nDuring the same time, the [[San Francisco, California|City and County of San Francisco]] passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 \"calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against [[Equality Alabama#Gaither|Mr. Gaither]]\"<ref>On February 19, 1999, in [[Coosa County, Alabama]], Billy Jack Gaither was beaten to death with an axe handle and his body was burned because he was homosexual.</ref> and Resolution No. 873-98 was specifically directed at \"anti-gay\" television advertisements. AFA unsuccessfully challenged these actions as violating the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in ''[[American Family Association v. City and County of San Francisco]]''.<ref name=AFAvSF/>\n\nIn 1998, multiple organizations voiced criticism of a series of AFA-sponsored full-page newspaper advertisements that promoted religious ministries involved in the [[ex-gay]] movement. In response to the advertisements, the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|Religious Leadership Roundtable]] said the ads employed \"language of violence and hatred to denounce other people\". [[IntegrityUSA]] criticized the ads, calling them \"evil\" disregarding Christian teachings about the \"dignity of every human being\".

Published in two Washington, D.C., newspapers as a full-page ad, the statement was organized by the powerful Family Research Council (FRC) and other 'pro-family organizations that are working to protect and promote natural marriage and the family.' The statement, whose signatories included House Speaker-Designate John Boehner and the governors of Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia, ran under the headline, 'Start Debating/Stop Hating.' It accused 'elements of the radical Left' of trying to 'shut down informed discussion of policy issues' and decried those who attempt to suppress debate 'through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent's character.' The SPLC, it said, was engaging in 'character assassination.'| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110420085730/http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2010/12/15/splc-responds-to-attack-by-frc-conservative-republicans/| archivedate= April 20, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> The advertisement stated the \"undersigned stand in solidarity\" with the organizations designated as hate groups, and that they \"support the vigorous but responsible exercise of the First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty that are the birthright of all Americans.\"<ref name=StartDebating/> House Speaker-Designate [[John Boehner]] and the governors of Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia were among those signing the statement.<ref name=\"SPLC Responds\"/> The SPLC addressed the new website statement; Potok was quoted by David Weigel of [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] magazine as saying, \"the SPLC's listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods&nbsp;\u2013 claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities&nbsp;\u2013 and repeated, groundless name-calling.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/archive/2010/12/15/boehner-cantor-bachmann-pence-and-more-against-the-southern-poverty-law-center.aspx |title=Boehner, Cantor, Bachmann, Pence and More Against the Southern Poverty Law Center |date=December 15, 2010 |last=Weigel |first=David |work=Weigel: Reporting About Politics and Policy |publisher=Slate |accessdate=April 22, 2011}} Mark Potok is quoted as saying, \"the SPLC's listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods&nbsp;\u2013 claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities&nbsp;\u2013 and repeated, groundless name-calling.\"</ref> The [[American Independent News Network]] (AINN) noted that the AFA had recently denounced Supreme Court justice [[Elena Kagan]] as a lesbian unfit for office&nbsp;\u2013 AINN stated that \"she's not\" a lesbian&nbsp;\u2013 and that Fischer said Hitler's savage and brutal methods were only possible because he and most of his stormtroopers were gay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iowaindependent.com/49054/king-hurley-sign-letter-of-support-for-%E2%80%98hate-groups%E2%80%99 |title=King, Hurley sign letter of support for 'hate groups': Conservatives come to the defense of Family Research Council, American Family Association |date=December 15, 2010 |last=Birkey |first=Andy |work=Iowa Independent |publisher=The American Independent News Network |accessdate=April 22, 2011 |quote=The Mississippi-based American Family Association recently said Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan should be disqualified from office because she's a lesbian (she's not).

Fischer has also argued for laws making homosexual sex illegal, claiming it is as lethal as intravenous drug use. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410232933/http://iowaindependent.com/49054/king-hurley-sign-letter-of-support-for-%E2%80%98hate-groups%E2%80%99 |archivedate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jillian Rayfield of ''[[Talking Points Memo]]'' noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a \"radical Left\" group \"spreading hateful rhetoric\" yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right \"can and must remain civil&nbsp;\u2013 but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent's character.\"<ref name=Rayfield2010/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Conservatism}}\n*[[Christian right]]\n*[[Christian fundamentalism]]\n*[[Radical right (United States)]]\n* [[New Right]]\n* [[Abiding Truth Ministries]]\n* [[Culture War]]\n* [[Religion and homosexuality]]\n* [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-gay hate groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book|last=Hunter|first=James Davison|title=Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America|url=https://archive.org/details/culturewars00jame|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=BasicBooks|place=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-01533-7|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.afa.net/ American Family Association] official site\n*[http://purl.oclc.org/umarchives/MUM00008/ American Family Association Collection (MUM00008)] owned by the University of Mississippi, Archives and Special Collections.\n\n{{American Social Conservatism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:American Family Association| ]]\n[[Category:1977 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations]]\n[[Category:American Christian political organizations]]\n[[Category:Boycott organizers]]\n[[Category:Censorship in the United States]]\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Christianity in Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Conservative organizations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Obscenity controversies]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1977]]\n[[Category:Organizations that oppose LGBT rights]]\n[[Category:Organizations that oppose same-sex marriage]]\n[[Category:Political organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Anti-abortion organizations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Tupelo, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Opposition to Islam in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Hazhk", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix a footnote error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Association"}
