[[John Ruskin]] objected to what he saw as desecration of the Derbyshire countryside, also to the fact that \"a Buxton fool may be able to find himself in Bakewell in twelve minutes, and vice versa.\" In return for the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s permission for the line to pass through his estate at Haddon Hall, Bakewell station buildings on the hillside overlooking the town are more imposing than expected, and the Duke's [[coat of arms]] are carved into the stonework. Such pandering to landowners was common at the time, as their support was needed to pass the Act of Parliament allowing the line to be built, although the inconvenient altitude of the railway forced Bakewell station to be placed out of town, as the Duke insisted it run out of sight of Haddon Hall. These station buildings are now used by small businesses, as the line between [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] and [[Buxton]] closed in 1968. Most of the track has been designated the [[Monsal Trail]], a motor traffic-free track for walking, cycling and horse riding.\n\n\"Normal\" trains now run from Derby via Ambergate only as far as [[Matlock railway station|Matlock]], and from Manchester only as far as Buxton. There have been repeated proposals for reopening the remaining, [[River Wye, Derbyshire|Wye Valley]], portion of the line, which would run through Bakewell and over the magnificent [[Monsal Dale]] viaduct.\n\n[[Peak Rail]], a local [[preserved railway]] venture, has shown the way by reopening the line from Matlock to Rowsley, a village a few miles to the east of Bakewell, near Haddon Hall. Reaching Bakewell is one of Peak Rail's long-term ambitions, and to keep alive the intention for a future return of the railway (under one auspice or another), Derbyshire County Council currently protects the track bed from development.\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:Rutland Arms Hotel 201307 149.jpg|thumb|Rutland Arms Hotel]]\nBakewell is known for the [[Bakewell pudding]], a jam [[pastry]] with a filling enriched with egg and ground almond. [[Bakewell tart]] is a different confection, made with [[shortcrust pastry]], an almond topping and a sponge and jam filling. [[Mr Kipling]] also made \"Cherry Bakewells\", often also known as Bakewell tarts. The origins of these are not clear, but the popular story is that it was first made by accident in 1820, when the landlady of the ''White Horse Inn'' (now the ''Rutland Arms Hotel'') left instructions for her cook to make a jam tart with an egg and almond-paste pastry base. The cook, instead of stirring the eggs and almond paste into the pastry, spread it on top of the jam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rutlandarmsbakewell.com/rutland-arms-hotel-bakewell.aspx |title=Rutland Arms Hotel Bakewell |publisher=Rutlandarmsbakewell.com |date= |accessdate=15 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916210854/http://www.rutlandarmsbakewell.com/rutland-arms-hotel-bakewell.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> When cooked the jam rose through the paste.

Its centre is near the river at about {{convert|410|ft|m}} above sea level, with the highest parts of the town at about {{convert|607|ft|m}} on the valley sides.<ref>Ordnance Survey (1989), 1:50,000 Landranger Series, Sheet 119 (Buxton, Matlock & Dove Dale area), {{ISBN|0-319-22119-9}}</ref> The town is in the Derbyshire Dales district and about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} south-west of [[Sheffield]], {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} south-east of [[Manchester]], and {{convert|21|mi|km|0}} north of [[Derby]].

Monday is popular with visitors as the town's traditional market day. The cattle market is held in a new purpose-built agricultural centre across the river from the main part of the town. A medium-sized stall market is held in the town centre.\n\nA major employer is the [[Peak District National Park Authority]] at Aldern House on Baslow Road.

The [[churchyard]] has two Saxon crosses. One is the Beeley Cross unearthed in a field at a disputed location near [[Beeley]] and moved for some years to the grounds of Holt House near [[Darley Bridge]]. Although only the base and lower part of the shaft survive, it stands over five feet high and is carved on all four faces.<ref name=\"sharpe\">{{Cite book |first=Neville T. |last=Sharpe |title=Crosses of the Peak District |publisher=Landmark Collectors Library |date=2002 |isbn=1843060191}}</ref> The other is the Bakewell Cross, eight feet high and almost complete. It was carved in the 7th\u20138th century and shows scenes that include the [[Annunciation]]. This may originally have stood at [[Hassop]] Cross Roads.<ref name=\"sharpe\" /> During restoration work in the 1840s, many carved fragments of Saxon stonework were found in and around the [[porch]] of the church, along with some ancient stone [[coffin]]s.\n\nThe church contains a selection of medieval and Anglo-Saxon cross fragments and carved stones collected by [[Thomas Bateman]] and donated to [[Weston Park Museum]] in [[Sheffield]], before being moved to Bakewell in 1899.<ref name=\"sharpe\" /> There is a notable [[alabaster]] memorial to Sir [[Godfrey de Foljambe]], who acquired the manor of Bakewell about 1350, and to his wife Avena.\n\nThe town also contains the [[Old House Museum, Bakewell|Old House Museum]] in a 16th-century house originating from the time of [[Henry VIII]] and extended under [[Elizabeth I]].<ref>[https://www.oldhousemuseum.org.uk/history.

Retrieved 4 November 2019.]</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n[[File:Bakewell, medieval bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bakewell's medieval bridge]] \nThe [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], which opened [[Bakewell railway station]] in 1862, became part of the [[Midland Railway]] and later of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] main line from [[London]] to [[Manchester]]. [[John Ruskin]] objected to what he saw as desecration of the Derbyshire countryside, also to the fact that \"a Buxton fool may be able to find himself in Bakewell in twelve minutes, and vice versa.\" In return for the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s permission for the line to pass through his estate at Haddon Hall, Bakewell station buildings on the hillside overlooking the town are more imposing than expected, and the Duke's [[coat of arms]] are carved into the stonework. Such pandering to landowners was common at the time, as their support was needed to pass the Act of Parliament allowing the line to be built, although the inconvenient altitude of the railway forced Bakewell station to be placed out of town, as the Duke insisted it run out of sight of Haddon Hall. These station buildings are now used by small businesses, as the line between [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] and [[Buxton]] closed in 1968. Most of the track has been designated the [[Monsal Trail]], a motor traffic-free track for walking, cycling and horse riding.\n\n\"Normal\" trains now run from Derby via Ambergate only as far as [[Matlock railway station|Matlock]], and from Manchester only as far as Buxton. There have been repeated proposals for reopening the remaining, [[River Wye, Derbyshire|Wye Valley]], portion of the line, which would run through Bakewell and over the magnificent [[Monsal Dale]] viaduct.\n\n[[Peak Rail]], a local [[preserved railway]] venture, has shown the way by reopening the line from Matlock to Rowsley, a village a few miles to the east of Bakewell, near Haddon Hall. Reaching Bakewell is one of Peak Rail's long-term ambitions, and to keep alive the intention for a future return of the railway (under one auspice or another), Derbyshire County Council currently protects the track bed from development.\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:Rutland Arms Hotel 201307 149.jpg|thumb|Rutland Arms Hotel]]\nBakewell is known for the [[Bakewell pudding]], a jam [[pastry]] with a filling enriched with egg and ground almond. [[Bakewell tart]] is a different confection, made with [[shortcrust pastry]], an almond topping and a sponge and jam filling. [[Mr Kipling]] also made \"Cherry Bakewells\", often also known as Bakewell tarts. The origins of these are not clear, but the popular story is that it was first made by accident in 1820, when the landlady of the ''White Horse Inn'' (now the ''Rutland Arms Hotel'') left instructions for her cook to make a jam tart with an egg and almond-paste pastry base. The cook, instead of stirring the eggs and almond paste into the pastry, spread it on top of the jam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rutlandarmsbakewell.com/rutland-arms-hotel-bakewell.aspx |title=Rutland Arms Hotel Bakewell |publisher=Rutlandarmsbakewell.com |date= |accessdate=15 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916210854/http://www.rutlandarmsbakewell.com/rutland-arms-hotel-bakewell.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> When cooked the jam rose through the paste.
