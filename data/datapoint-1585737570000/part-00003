Jan Matejko).jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Coronation of the First King]]'', [[Jan Matejko]]; depicts the coronation of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boleslaus I the Brave]]]]\n\nThe basis for the development of a Polish state was laid by the [[Piast dynasty]], which had been preeminent since the 10th century. The conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] to [[Christianity]] paved the way for Poland to become a member of the family of Christian kingdoms. In 1000, during the [[Congress of Gniezno]], Poland was recognized as a state by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Pope]]. In 1025, Duke [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus I the Brave]] was crowned King of Poland, marking the starting date for a Polish Kingdom, though for long years the Poles were ruled not by Kings but by Dukes.\n\nThe King ruled the country in his own responsibility but was expected to respect traditional customs of the people. The succession to the rule was not legally restricted by primogeniture. All sons of the King or Duke had the same rights of inheritance, and the one that in some way proved the strongest succeeded to the throne.\n\n===Period of fragmentation===\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw III the Wrymouth]], who reigned from 1102 to 1138, tried to end the repeated struggles between various claimants by setting the government of Poland on a more formal footing. In [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|his testament]], he divided his lands into five Duchies and distributed them among his sons.\n\nTo ensure unity, he established the ''senioral principle'', which stated that the eldest member of the dynasty should be High Duke and have supreme power over the other Dukes. The High Duke ruled, in addition to the Duchy he inherited, over the indivisible ''senioral part'', a vast strip of land running north-south down the middle of Poland, with Krak\u00f3w as the chief city. The High Duke's prerogatives also included control over [[Pomerania]], a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWhile the senorial part always fell to that member of the Dynasty that happened to be senior, the other four Duchies were inherited in the usual way among the descendants of Boleslaw's sons. These provisions were soon broken, however, with the various Dukes trying to gain the position of High Duke for themselves, regardless of actual seniority. The provisions, meant to ensure unity fragmented the country even further and resulted in a decline of monarchical power. Poland even came under the influence of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] kings of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], whose dynasty died out before they could gain a stable foothold in Poland.\n\nThe accession of the Piast Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] ended the power struggle amongst the Polish nobility. He united the various principalities of the Kingdom of Poland, and in 1320 he was crowned King. His son [[Casimir III the Great]] greatly strengthened the Polish state in both foreign and domestic affairs.\n\nCasimir was the last male member of the [[Piast dynasty]] and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]]. The upsurge of the monarchy continued under Louis, during the [[union of Hungary and Poland]].\n\nSince Louis had no son either, his daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] became the heir of the Polish monarchy. Under the terms of the [[Union of Krewo]], she married [[Jogaila]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], who converted to Christianity. This marriage created not only a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania but also bound the two countries together for the next four centuries.\n\nThe period of rule by the [[Piast dynasty]] between the 10th and 14th centuries is the first major stage of the [[history of Poland|history of the Polish nation]]. The dynasty was founded by a series of dukes listed by the chronicler [[Gallus Anonymous]] in the early 12th century: [[Siemowit]], [[Lestek]] and [[Siemomys\u0142]]. It was [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the son of Siemomys\u0142, who is now considered the proper founder of the Polish state at about 960 AD.<ref name=\"Kronika S\u0142owian II 95\">Witold Chrzanowski, ''Kronika S\u0142owian, tom II Polanie'' (The Chronicle of the Slavs, Volume II: The Polans), p. 95, Wydawnictwo EGIS, Krak\u00f3w 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-7396-749-6}}</ref>  The [[dynasty|ruling house]] then remained in power in the Polish lands until 1370. Mieszko converted to [[Christianity]] of the Western [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] in an event known as the [[Baptism of Poland]] in 966, which established a major cultural boundary in [[Europe]] based on religion. He also completed a unification of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribal lands that was fundamental to the existence of the new country of Poland.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Polish state, [[List of Polish monarchs|a series of rulers]] converted the population to [[Christianity]], created a [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 and integrated Poland into the prevailing [[culture of Europe]]. Mieszko's son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] established a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno]], pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|king of Poland]]. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of [[Mieszko II Lambert]] in 1034, followed by its restoration under [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir I]] in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]] revived the military assertiveness of Boles\u0142aw I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w]] and was expelled from the country.\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|Boles\u0142aw III]], the last duke of the early period, succeeded in defending his country and recovering territories previously lost. Upon his death in 1138, Poland was [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|divided among his sons]]. The resulting internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchical structure in the 12th and 13th centuries and caused fundamental and lasting changes.\n\n[[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans, which led to centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and the [[Duchy of Prussia|German Prussian state]].\n\nIn 1320, the kingdom was restored under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], then strengthened and expanded by his son [[Casimir III the Great]]. The western provinces of [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]] were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of two members of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|kingdom of Poland]] that was to follow.\n\n== 10th\u201312th century ==\n\n=== Mieszko I and the adoption of Christianity in Poland (ca. 960\u2013992) ===\n\n[[File:Ostr\u00f3w Tumski 07.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Important early stages in the history of the Polish state and church took place on the island of [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]].

Mieszko fought wars with the [[Polabian Slavs]], the Czechs, [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] of the [[Saxon Eastern March]] in 963\u2013964 and Margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo I]] of the Saxon Eastern March in 972 in the [[Battle of Cedynia]]. The victories over Wichmann and Odo allowed Mieszko to extend his [[Pomerania]]n possessions west to the vicinity of the [[Oder|Oder River]] and its mouth. After the death of Otto I, and then again after the death of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto II]], Mieszko supported [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]], a pretender to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|imperial crown]]. After the death of Doubravka in 977, Mieszko married [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda von Haldensleben]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Haldensleben|Dietrich]], Margrave of the [[Northern March]], ca. 980. When fighting the Czechs in 990, Mieszko was helped by the Holy Roman Empire. By about the year 990, when Mieszko I officially submitted his country to the authority of the [[Holy See]] (''[[Dagome iudex]]''), he had transformed Poland into one of the strongest powers in [[Eastern Europe|central-eastern Europe]].<ref name=\"Kurnatowska\"/>\n\n=== The reign of Boles\u0142aw I and establishment of a Kingdom of Poland (992\u20131025) ===\n[[File:Drzwi gnieznienskie wykupienie zwlok Wojciecha.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|An image on the [[Gniezno Doors]] at the entrance to [[Gniezno Cathedral]] depicts [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw]] buying [[Adalbert of Prague|Adalbert's]] body back from the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]]]\n\nWhen Mieszko I died in 992, he was succeeded by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw]] contrary to his wishes.

Boles\u0142aw was Mieszko's oldest son, born to his first wife [[Doubravka of Bohemia]], who died in 977.  His father intended to divide the duchy of Poland between his sons, but Boles\u0142aw succeeded in displacing his stepmother and stepbrothers to become the sole ruler of Poland. Consistent with the intrigues he pursued at the start of his reign to secure his throne, Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry (\"the Brave\") proved himself to be a man of high ambition and strong personality.\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland (992\u20131025); area within dark pink color represents the borders at the end of the rule of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] (992); dark red border comprises the area at the end of the reign of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw I]] (1025) ]]\nOne of the most important concerns of Boles\u0142aw's early reign was building up the Polish church. Boles\u0142aw cultivated [[Adalbert of Prague]] of the [[Slavn\u00edk dynasty|Slavn\u00edk family]], a well-connected [[Czechs|Czech]] bishop in exile and missionary who was killed in 997 while on a mission in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]].  Boles\u0142aw skillfully took advantage of his death: his [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] led to his elevation as patron saint of Poland and resulted in the creation of an independent Polish province of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] with [[Radim Gaudentius]] as [[Archbishop of Gniezno]]. In the year 1000, the young [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] came as a pilgrim to visit St. Adalbert's grave and lent his support to Boles\u0142aw during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] and several subordinate [[diocese]]s were established on this occasion. The Polish [[ecclesiastical province]] effectively served as an essential anchor and an institution to fall back on for the Piast state, helping it to survive in the troubled centuries ahead.<ref name=\"Pleszczy\u0144ski 1\"/>\n\nBoles\u0142aw at first chose to continue his father's policy of cooperation with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] but when Emperor  Otto III died in 1002, Boles\u0142aw's relationship with his successor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] turned out to be much more difficult, and it resulted in a series of wars (1002\u20131005, 1007\u20131013, 1015\u20131018).  From 1003\u20131004, Boles\u0142aw intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from [[Bohemia]] in 1018,<ref>Makk, Ferenc (1993).

The conflicts with Germany ended in 1018 with the [[Peace of Bautzen]] on favorable terms for Boles\u0142aw. In the context of the 1018 [[Boleslaw I's intervention in the Kievan succession crisis, 1018|Kiev expedition]], Boles\u0142aw took over the western part of [[Red Ruthenia]].

Casimir was aided by recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of [[feudalism]] and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of [[Greater Poland]] after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to [[Krak\u00f3w]] and replaced the old Piast capitals of Pozna\u0144 and Gniezno; Krak\u00f3w would function as the nation's capital for several centuries.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 96\u201398\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), p. 96\u201398</ref><ref name=\"Szczur \u015aredniowiecze 106-107\">Stanis\u0142aw Szczur, ''Historia Polski-\u015bredniowiecze'' (History of Poland: The Middle Ages), [[Wydawnictwo Literackie]], Krak\u00f3w 2002, {{ISBN|978-83-08-04135-2}}, pp. 106-107</ref>\n\n=== Boles\u0142aw II and the conflict with Bishop Stanis\u0142aw (1058\u20131079) ===\n\n[[File:Wawel St Leonard.JPG|220 px|right|thumb|[[St. Leonard's Crypt]] is all that remains of the second [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Wawel Cathedral]] of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman]]]]\n\nCasimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]], also known as the Generous (r. 1058\u20131079), developed Polish military strength and waged several foreign campaigns between 1058 and 1077.

Zbigniew had to leave the country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], who attacked Boles\u0142aw's Poland in 1109. Boles\u0142aw was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see [[Battle of G\u0142og\u00f3w]]). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Boles\u0142aw's other major achievement was the conquest of all of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I's]] [[Pomerania]] (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman]] and completed by Boles\u0142aw around 1123.

He made complex arrangements intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Boles\u0142aw's death, the implementation of the plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Krak\u00f3w and assigned to the special [[Seniorate Province]] that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Boles\u0142aw divided the country into five principalities: [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]], [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], [[Duchy of Masovia|Masovia]], [[Duchy of Sandomierz|Sandomierz]] and [[Seniorate Province|Krak\u00f3w]]. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Krak\u00f3w, was to be added to the senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Krak\u00f3w, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Boles\u0142aw III's sons, when [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]], [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]] and [[Casimir II the Just]] fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Krak\u00f3w.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 104\u2013111\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 104\u2013111</ref>\n\nThe external borders left by Boles\u0142aw III at his death closely resembled the borders left by [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]; this original early Piast monarchy configuration had not survived the fragmentation period.<ref>''Atlas historyczny Polski'' (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, p. 4 and 5</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|right|275 px|[[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]] (late 1240\u20131241) culminated in the [[Battle of Legnica]]]]\n\nFrom the time of the conversion of Poland's ruling elite to Christianity in the 10th century, foreign churchmen had been arriving and the [[culture of medieval Poland|culture of early Medieval Poland]] was developing as a part of European [[Christendom]].  However, it would be a few generations from the time of Mieszko's conversion until significant numbers of native clergymen appeared. After the establishment of numerous [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, Christianization of the populace was accomplished on a larger scale.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland''.

Written [[annals]] began to be generated in the late 10th century; leaders such as Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer were considered literate and educated.  Along with the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' act, the most important written document and source of the period is the ''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'', a chronicle by [[Gallus Anonymus]], a foreign cleric from the court of Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] was one of the pioneering [[Western culture|Western]] clergymen spreading Church literacy; some of his prominent writings had been produced in [[hermit|eremitic]] monasteries in Poland.

The [[Gniezno Doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]] in bronze low relief, dating from the 1170s, are the finest examples of Romanesque sculpture in Poland.\n\n== 13th century ==\n\n=== State and society; German settlement ===\n[[File:Sachsenspiegel-Ostsiedlung.jpg|275 px|thumb|right|[[Ostsiedlung]] or German settlement in the east, miniature from [[Sachsenspiegel]]]]\n\nThe 13th century brought fundamental changes to the structure of Polish society and its political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western [[Farther Pomerania]] broke its political ties with Poland in the second half of the 12th century and from 1231 became a [[fiefdom|fief]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the [[S\u0142awno]] and [[S\u0142upsk]] areas. [[Pomerelia]] or [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]] granted [[Lubusz Land]] to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the [[Neumark]] and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, [[Leszek I the White|Leszek the White]] was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the [[Halych]] area of [[Rus (name)|Rus']], a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 116\u2013128</ref>\n\nThe social status was becoming increasingly based on the size of feudal land possessions. Those included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, and the knightly class. The work force ranged from hired \"free\" people to [[serfdom|serfs]] attached to the land, to slaves (either purchased, forced into slavery after capture in war or forced into slavery as prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, was able to acquire economic and [[Sovereign immunity|legal immunity]], which it exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction and economic obligations such as taxation that had previously been imposed by the ruling dukes.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n[[File:Toru\u01442017.jpg|thumb|left|250 px |[[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]], established by the [[Teutonic Knights]] became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]]]\n\nCivil strife and foreign invasions, such as the [[Mongol invasions]] in [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|1240/1241]], [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|1259/1260]] and [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|1287/1288]], weakened and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers]]; the early waves from Germany and [[Flanders]] occurred in the 1220s.<ref>[[John Radzilowski]], ''A Traveller's History of Poland''; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-56656-655-X}}, p. 260</ref> The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and [[German town law]]s were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important in the rise of the cities and the establishment of the Polish [[bourgeoisie|burgher]] (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws ([[Magdeburg rights]]) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciates]]) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/><ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201316</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' , p. 366</ref>\n\nIn 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks|W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Laskonogi]]. The titular Duke of Poland promised to provide a \"just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons.\" Such legal guarantees and privileges included the lower level land owners and knights, who were evolving into the lower and middle nobility class known later as ''[[szlachta]]''. The period of fragmentation weakened the rulers and established a permanent trend in Polish history, whereby the rights and role of the nobility were expanded at the monarch's expense.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n=== Relations with the Teutonic Knights ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich von Breslau.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Henry IV Probus|Henry IV of Wroc\u0142aw]] in the [[Codex Manesse]], about 1300]]\n\nIn 1226, Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the pagan, Baltic [[Old Prussians]], who lived in a territory adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the [[Old Prussians]] themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including [[Northern Crusades]] sponsored by the papacy. The [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad ([[Che\u0142mno]] Land or [[Kulmerland]]). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and established their own [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state]]. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a [[fiefdom|fief]] and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 128\u2013129\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 128\u2013129</ref><ref>John Radzilowski, ''A Traveller's History of Poland'',  pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\n=== Reunification attempts and the reigns of Przemys\u0142 II and V\u00e1clav II (1232\u20131305) ===\n[[File:Jakub \u015awinka.PNG|thumb|left|185 px|Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]]]]\n\nAs the disadvantages of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various segments of the society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were the activities of the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian dukes]] [[Henry I the Bearded]], his son [[Henry II the Pious]], who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the [[Battle of Legnica]], and [[Henry IV Probus]]. In 1295, [[Przemys\u0142 II]] of [[Greater Poland]] became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Boles\u0142aw II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II of Bohemia]] of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], who married [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland|Przemys\u0142's daughter Richeza]] and became King of Poland in 1300. V\u00e1clav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.\n\n[[File:Catedral de San Juan, Breslavia, Polonia, 2017-12-20, DD 14.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Wroc\u0142aw Cathedral|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]]]\nAn important factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]] of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed the crowning ceremonies for both Przemys\u0142 II and [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]]. \u015awinka supported [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I \u0141okietek]] at various stages of the duke's career.\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[culture of medieval Poland|Culturally]], the social impact of the Church was considerably broader in the 13th century, as networks of parishes were established and cathedral-type schools became more common.  The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscan]]s were the leading monastic orders at this time, and they interacted closely with the general population. A proliferation of narrative [[annals]] characterized the period, as well as other written records, laws and documents. More of the clergy were of local origin; others were expected to know the Polish language. [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the author of an [[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|influential chronicle]], was the most recognized representative in the intellectual sphere.  ''Perspectiva'', a treatise on [[optics]] by [[Witelo]], a Silesian monk, was one of the finest achievements of [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]]. The construction of churches and castles in the [[Gothic architecture]] style predominated in the 13th century; native elements in art forms were increasingly important, with significant advances taking place in agriculture, manufacturing and crafts.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 141\u2013144\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 141\u2013144</ref>\n\n== 14th century ==\n\n=== The reunited kingdom of the last Piast rulers; Jewish settlement ===\n[[File:W\u0142adys\u0142aw I sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|left|190 px|A fragment of a sandstone [[sarcophagus]] depicting [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] in [[Wawel Cathedral]], Krak\u00f3w]]\n[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]  and his son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III, \"the Great\"]], were the last two rulers of the Piast dynasty of the unified kingdom of Poland of the 14th century.  Their rule was not a return to the Polish state as it existed before the period of fragmentation, because of the loss of internal cohesion and territorial integrity. The regional Piast princes remained strong, and for economic and cultural reasons, some of them gravitated toward Poland's neighbors. The kingdom lost Pomerania and Silesia, the most highly developed and economically important regions of the original ethnically Polish lands, which left half of the Polish population outside the kingdom's borders. The western losses had to do with the failure of the unification efforts undertaken by the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] dukes and the German expansion processes. These included the Piast principalities developing (or falling into) dependencies in respect to the German political structures, [[Ostsiedlung|settler colonization]] and gradual [[Germanisation|Germanization]] of the Polish ruling circles. The lower [[Vistula]] was controlled by the Teutonic Order. [[Masovia]] was not to be fully incorporated into the Polish state in the near future. Casimir stabilized the western and northern borders, tried to regain some of the lost territories, and partially compensated the losses by new eastern expansion that placed within his kingdom regions that were [[East Slavs|East Slavic]], thus ethnically non-Polish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 15\u201334\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 15\u201334</ref><ref name=\"Wyrozumski 145\u2013154\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 145\u2013154</ref>\n\nDespite the territorial truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced a period of accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy.

In 1264, Duke [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which specified a broad range of freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements.<ref>Davies, Norman (2005).

Afterwards, W\u0142adys\u0142aw  completed the takeover of [[Lesser Poland]], entering Krak\u00f3w, and took the lands north of there, through Kuyavia all the way to [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]]. In 1308, Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state. In a recovery effort, W\u0142adys\u0142aw agreed to ask for help from the Teutonic Knights; the Knights brutally [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)|took over Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] and kept it for themselves.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nIn 1311\u20131312, a [[rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert|rebellion in Krak\u00f3w]] instigated by the city's [[patricianship|patrician]] leadership seeking rule by the [[House of Luxembourg]] was put down. This event may have had a limiting impact on the emerging political power of towns.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nIn 1313\u20131314, W\u0142adys\u0142aw conquered [[Greater Poland]]. In 1320, he became the first king of Poland crowned in Krak\u00f3w's [[Wawel Cathedral]] instead of [[Gniezno]]. The coronation was hesitantly agreed to by [[Pope John XXII]] in spite of the opposition of King [[John of Bohemia]], who had also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook an expedition aimed at Krak\u00f3w in 1327, which he was compelled to abort; in 1328, he waged a crusade against Lithuania, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order. The Order was in a state of [[Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1326\u20131332)|war with Poland]] from 1327 to 1332 (see [[Battle of P\u0142owce]]). As a result, the Knights captured [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kujawy]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw was helped by his alliances with Hungary (his daughter [[Elisabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] was married to King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1320) and Lithuania (in a pact of 1325 against the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] and the marriage of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]] to [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona]], daughter of the Lithuanian ruler [[Gediminas]]).<ref name=\"Chronology 74\u201375\">Ed.

A lasting achievement of King [[John of Bohemia]] (and a great loss to Poland) was his success in forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities, often ambivalent about their loyalties, into [[allegiance]] between 1327 and 1329.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201326</ref>\n\n=== The reign of Casimir III the Great (1333\u20131370) ===\n[[File:Polska 1333 - 1370.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland at the end of the rule of [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] (1370) is shown within the dark red border; [[Silesia]] (yellow) was lost, while the kingdom had expanded to the east]]\n\nAfter the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, the old monarch's 23-year-old son became King Casimir III, later known as [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] (r. 1333\u20131370). Unlike his father, the new king demonstrated no attraction for the hardships of military life.  Casimir's contemporaries did not give him much of a chance of overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a ruler. But from the beginning, Casimir acted prudently, and in 1335, he purchased the claims of King John of Bohemia to the Polish throne.  In 1343, Casimir settled several high-level arbitration disputes with the Teutonic Order by a territorial compromise that culminated in the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz]] of 1343. [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kuyavia]] were recovered by Casimir. At that time, Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366, Casimir annexed the [[Halych]]\u2013[[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]] [[Galicia-Volhynia|area of Rus']]. The town of [[Lviv]] there attracted newcomers of several nationalities, was granted [[Magdeburg rights|municipal rights]] in 1356, and had thus begun its career as [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]], the main Polish center in the midst of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Hungarian ruling house]] the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 26\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Casimir III of Poland.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Foundation of the [[Collegiate church in Wi\u015blica]] by [[Casimir III the Great]]]]\n\nCasimir, who formally gave up his rights to several [[Silesia]]n principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the [[House of Luxembourg]] (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] by Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.\n\nAllied with Denmark and Western Pomerania (Gda\u0144sk Pomerania was granted to the Order as an \"eternal charity\"), Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border. In 1365, [[Drezdenko]] and [[Santok]] became Poland's [[fiefdom|fiefs]], while the [[Wa\u0142cz]] district was taken outright in 1368. The latter action severed the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connected Poland with [[Farther Pomerania]].\n\nCasimir the Great considerably solidified the country's position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Domestically, he integrated and centralized the reunited Polish state and helped develop what was considered the \"[[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]]\": the state within its actual boundaries, as well as past or potential boundaries. Casimir established or strengthened kingdom-wide institutions (such as the powerful state treasury) independent of the regional, class, or royal court-related interests. Internationally, the Polish king was very active diplomatically; he cultivated close contacts with other European rulers and was a staunch defender of the Polish national interest. In 1364, he sponsored the [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w]], in which a number of monarchs participated, which was concerned with the promotion of peaceful cooperation and political balance in Central Europe.\n\n=== The reign of Louis I and Jadwiga (1370\u20131399) ===\n\n[[File:Jadwiga by Bacciarelli.jpg|left|thumb|180 px|[[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] was the great-granddaughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]]]\n[[File:Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel.jpg|Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel|right|thumb|350 px|[[Wawel Castle]] in [[Krakow]]]]\nImmediately after Casimir's death in 1370, the heirless king's nephew [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual commitment to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir of S\u0142upsk]]), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves; the formal act was negotiated in [[Buda]] in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]]'s sister [[Elizabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] in Poland as [[regent]]s.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 169\u2013173</ref>\n\nWith the death of Casimir the Great, the period of hereditary (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included the beginning of the [[general sejm]], the dominant bicameral parliament of the future.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|right|Woodcut of Krak\u00f3w from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493]]\n\n\nDuring the reign of Louis I, Poland formed a [[Polish-Hungarian union]]. In the pact of 1374 (the [[Privilege of Koszyce]]), the Polish nobility was granted extensive concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted in the loss of Casimir's territorial gains, including [[Halych]] [[Rus (name)|Rus']], which was recovered by Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband [[Jogaila|Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila)]] forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating [[Lesser Poland]] from [[Greater Poland]], previously granted by King Louis to his [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] ally Duke [[Vladislaus II of Opole|W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Opole]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 42\u201344\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 42\u201344</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian-Polish union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. After Louis's death in 1382 and a power struggle that resulted in the [[Greater Poland Civil War]], the Polish nobility decided that Jadwiga, Louis's youngest daughter, should become the next \"King of Poland\"; Jadwiga arrived in 1384 and was crowned at the age of eleven. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the [[Polish-Lithuanian union|union of Lithuania and Poland]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n\n=== Culture ===\nIn the 14th century, many large scale [[Architecture of medieval Poland|brick building projects]] were undertaken during Casimir's reign, including the construction of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents.  The most notable examples of architecture from the medieval period in Poland are the many churches representing the [[Polish Gothic]] style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are best revealed in the furnishings of churches and liturgical items.  Polish law was first codified in the [[Statutes of Casimir the Great]] (the Piotrk\u00f3w\u2013Wi\u015blica Statutes) from 1346\u20131362.  Accordingly, conflict resolution relied on legal proceedings domestically, while bilateral or multilateral negotiations and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. By this time, the network of cathedral and parish schools had become well developed. In 1364, Casimir the Great established the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], the second oldest university in Central Europe. While many still traveled to southern and western Europe for university studies, the [[Old Polish language|Polish language]], along with the predominant [[Latin]], became increasingly more common in written documents. The [[Holy Cross Sermons]] (ca. early 14th century) constitute possibly the oldest extant Polish prose manuscript.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 173\u2013177\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 173\u2013177</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]\n* [[Culture of medieval Poland]]\n* [[Slavery in Poland]]\n* [[List of Polish monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===Translations and transliterations===\n{{special characters}}{{reflist|group=\"trans\"|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Middle Ages}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poland, Kingdom of, (1025-1385)}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1025]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Poland| ]]\n[[Category:History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]\n[[Category:1025 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1380s disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:14th-century disestablishments in Poland]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2017}}{{Infobox country\n|native_name=''Kr\u00f3lestwo Polskie'' <small>([[Polish language|pl]])</small><br />''Regnum Poloniae'' <small>([[Latin language|la]])</small>\n|conventional_long_name= Kingdom of Poland \n|common_name = Poland\n|p1= Civitas Schinesghe\n|flag_p1=Emblem of Civitas Schinesghe.svg\n|border_p1=no\n|s1=Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)\n|flag_s1=Kingdom of Poland-flag.svg\n|border_s1=no\n|year_start=1025\n|event_start = Coronation of [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]]\n|year_end=1385\n|event_end = [[Union of Krewo]]\n|image_flag= Kingdom of Poland-flag.svg\n|flag_border= no\n|flag_type= Royal Banner\n|image_coat= Insigne Polonicum.svg\n|symbol=Coat of arms of Poland\n|image_map =Dzia\u0142ania podczas wojny polsko niemieckiej 1002-1005.png\n|image_map_caption =Widest span of the Kingdom of Poland before the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], during the years of expansion in 1002-1005.\n|government_type=Monarchy\n|common_languages=[[Old Polish language|Old Polish]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]\n|religion=[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] (official),<br>[[Slavic paganism|Pagan]] (widely practiced)\n|capital=[[Gniezno]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[P\u0142ock]], [[Krak\u00f3w]]\n|national_anthem        = \"[[Bogurodzica]]\"<br /><small>\"Mother of God\"</small><br><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-top:0.4em;\">[[File:Bogurodzica - Collegium Vocale.ogg|alt=sound clip of Bogurodzica]]</div><br>\"[[Gaude Mater Polonia]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-pesni.org/polsk/gaudemater.htm|title=Gaude Mater Polonia Creation and History|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">[[Gaude Mater Polonia]] was the second national anthem; although, [[Bogurodzica]] was still the main national anthem.

Jan Matejko).jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Coronation of the First King]]'', [[Jan Matejko]]; depicts the coronation of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boleslaus I the Brave]]]]\n\nThe basis for the development of a Polish state was laid by the [[Piast dynasty]], which had been preeminent since the 10th century. The conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] to [[Christianity]] paved the way for Poland to become a member of the family of Christian kingdoms. In 1000, during the [[Congress of Gniezno]], Poland was recognized as a state by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Pope]]. In 1025, Duke [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus I the Brave]] was crowned King of Poland, marking the starting date for a Polish Kingdom, though for long years the Poles were ruled not by Kings but by Dukes.\n\nThe King ruled the country in his own responsibility but was expected to respect traditional customs of the people. The succession to the rule was not legally restricted by primogeniture. All sons of the King or Duke had the same rights of inheritance, and the one that in some way proved the strongest succeeded to the throne.\n\n===Period of fragmentation===\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw III the Wrymouth]], who reigned from 1102 to 1138, tried to end the repeated struggles between various claimants by setting the government of Poland on a more formal footing. In [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|his testament]], he divided his lands into five Duchies and distributed them among his sons.\n\nTo ensure unity, he established the ''senioral principle'', which stated that the eldest member of the dynasty should be High Duke and have supreme power over the other Dukes. The High Duke ruled, in addition to the Duchy he inherited, over the indivisible ''senioral part'', a vast strip of land running north-south down the middle of Poland, with Krak\u00f3w as the chief city. The High Duke's prerogatives also included control over [[Pomerania]], a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWhile the senorial part always fell to that member of the Dynasty that happened to be senior, the other four Duchies were inherited in the usual way among the descendants of Boleslaw's sons. These provisions were soon broken, however, with the various Dukes trying to gain the position of High Duke for themselves, regardless of actual seniority. The provisions, meant to ensure unity fragmented the country even further and resulted in a decline of monarchical power. Poland even came under the influence of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] kings of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], whose dynasty died out before they could gain a stable foothold in Poland.\n\nThe accession of the Piast Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] ended the power struggle amongst the Polish nobility. He united the various principalities of the Kingdom of Poland, and in 1320 he was crowned King. His son [[Casimir III the Great]] greatly strengthened the Polish state in both foreign and domestic affairs.\n\nCasimir was the last male member of the [[Piast dynasty]] and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]]. The upsurge of the monarchy continued under Louis, during the [[union of Hungary and Poland]].\n\nSince Louis had no son either, his daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] became the heir of the Polish monarchy. Under the terms of the [[Union of Krewo]], she married [[Jogaila]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], who converted to Christianity. This marriage created not only a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania but also bound the two countries together for the next four centuries.\n\nThe period of rule by the [[Piast dynasty]] between the 10th and 14th centuries is the first major stage of the [[history of Poland|history of the Polish nation]]. The dynasty was founded by a series of dukes listed by the chronicler [[Gallus Anonymous]] in the early 12th century: [[Siemowit]], [[Lestek]] and [[Siemomys\u0142]]. It was [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the son of Siemomys\u0142, who is now considered the proper founder of the Polish state at about 960 AD.<ref name=\"Kronika S\u0142owian II 95\">Witold Chrzanowski, ''Kronika S\u0142owian, tom II Polanie'' (The Chronicle of the Slavs, Volume II: The Polans), p. 95, Wydawnictwo EGIS, Krak\u00f3w 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-7396-749-6}}</ref>  The [[dynasty|ruling house]] then remained in power in the Polish lands until 1370. Mieszko converted to [[Christianity]] of the Western [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] in an event known as the [[Baptism of Poland]] in 966, which established a major cultural boundary in [[Europe]] based on religion. He also completed a unification of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribal lands that was fundamental to the existence of the new country of Poland.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Polish state, [[List of Polish monarchs|a series of rulers]] converted the population to [[Christianity]], created a [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 and integrated Poland into the prevailing [[culture of Europe]]. Mieszko's son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] established a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno]], pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|king of Poland]]. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of [[Mieszko II Lambert]] in 1034, followed by its restoration under [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir I]] in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]] revived the military assertiveness of Boles\u0142aw I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w]] and was expelled from the country.\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|Boles\u0142aw III]], the last duke of the early period, succeeded in defending his country and recovering territories previously lost. Upon his death in 1138, Poland was [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|divided among his sons]]. The resulting internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchical structure in the 12th and 13th centuries and caused fundamental and lasting changes.\n\n[[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans, which led to centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and the [[Duchy of Prussia|German Prussian state]].\n\nIn 1320, the kingdom was restored under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], then strengthened and expanded by his son [[Casimir III the Great]]. The western provinces of [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]] were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of two members of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|kingdom of Poland]] that was to follow.\n\n== 10th\u201312th century ==\n\n=== Mieszko I and the adoption of Christianity in Poland (ca. 960\u2013992) ===\n\n[[File:Ostr\u00f3w Tumski 07.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Important early stages in the history of the Polish state and church took place on the island of [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]].

Mieszko fought wars with the [[Polabian Slavs]], the Czechs, [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] of the [[Saxon Eastern March]] in 963\u2013964 and Margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo I]] of the Saxon Eastern March in 972 in the [[Battle of Cedynia]]. The victories over Wichmann and Odo allowed Mieszko to extend his [[Pomerania]]n possessions west to the vicinity of the [[Oder|Oder River]] and its mouth. After the death of Otto I, and then again after the death of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto II]], Mieszko supported [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]], a pretender to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|imperial crown]]. After the death of Doubravka in 977, Mieszko married [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda von Haldensleben]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Haldensleben|Dietrich]], Margrave of the [[Northern March]], ca. 980. When fighting the Czechs in 990, Mieszko was helped by the Holy Roman Empire.

Boles\u0142aw was Mieszko's oldest son, born to his first wife [[Doubravka of Bohemia]], who died in 977.  His father intended to divide the duchy of Poland between his sons, but Boles\u0142aw succeeded in displacing his stepmother and stepbrothers to become the sole ruler of Poland. Consistent with the intrigues he pursued at the start of his reign to secure his throne, Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry (\"the Brave\") proved himself to be a man of high ambition and strong personality.\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland (992\u20131025); area within dark pink color represents the borders at the end of the rule of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] (992); dark red border comprises the area at the end of the reign of [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw I]] (1025) ]]\nOne of the most important concerns of Boles\u0142aw's early reign was building up the Polish church. Boles\u0142aw cultivated [[Adalbert of Prague]] of the [[Slavn\u00edk dynasty|Slavn\u00edk family]], a well-connected [[Czechs|Czech]] bishop in exile and missionary who was killed in 997 while on a mission in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]].  Boles\u0142aw skillfully took advantage of his death: his [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] led to his elevation as patron saint of Poland and resulted in the creation of an independent Polish province of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] with [[Radim Gaudentius]] as [[Archbishop of Gniezno]]. In the year 1000, the young [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] came as a pilgrim to visit St. Adalbert's grave and lent his support to Boles\u0142aw during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] and several subordinate [[diocese]]s were established on this occasion. The Polish [[ecclesiastical province]] effectively served as an essential anchor and an institution to fall back on for the Piast state, helping it to survive in the troubled centuries ahead.<ref name=\"Pleszczy\u0144ski 1\"/>\n\nBoles\u0142aw at first chose to continue his father's policy of cooperation with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] but when Emperor  Otto III died in 1002, Boles\u0142aw's relationship with his successor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] turned out to be much more difficult, and it resulted in a series of wars (1002\u20131005, 1007\u20131013, 1015\u20131018).  From 1003\u20131004, Boles\u0142aw intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from [[Bohemia]] in 1018,<ref>Makk, Ferenc (1993).

In 1013, the marriage between Boles\u0142aw's son [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko]] and [[Richeza of Lotharingia]], the niece of Emperor Otto III and future mother of [[Casimir I the Restorer]], took place. The conflicts with Germany ended in 1018 with the [[Peace of Bautzen]] on favorable terms for Boles\u0142aw. In the context of the 1018 [[Boleslaw I's intervention in the Kievan succession crisis, 1018|Kiev expedition]], Boles\u0142aw took over the western part of [[Red Ruthenia]].

Mieszko was defeated and forced to leave Poland.  Mieszko's brother [[Bezprym]] was murdered in 1032, whereas his brother Otto died in unclear circumstances in 1033, events that permitted Mieszko to recover his authority partially.  The first Piast monarchy then collapsed with Mieszko's death in 1034.

Casimir was aided by recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of [[feudalism]] and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of [[Greater Poland]] after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to [[Krak\u00f3w]] and replaced the old Piast capitals of Pozna\u0144 and Gniezno; Krak\u00f3w would function as the nation's capital for several centuries.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 96\u201398\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), p. 96\u201398</ref><ref name=\"Szczur \u015aredniowiecze 106-107\">Stanis\u0142aw Szczur, ''Historia Polski-\u015bredniowiecze'' (History of Poland: The Middle Ages), [[Wydawnictwo Literackie]], Krak\u00f3w 2002, {{ISBN|978-83-08-04135-2}}, pp. 106-107</ref>\n\n=== Boles\u0142aw II and the conflict with Bishop Stanis\u0142aw (1058\u20131079) ===\n\n[[File:Wawel St Leonard.JPG|220 px|right|thumb|[[St. Leonard's Crypt]] is all that remains of the second [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Wawel Cathedral]] of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman]]]]\n\nCasimir's son [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]], also known as the Generous (r. 1058\u20131079), developed Polish military strength and waged several foreign campaigns between 1058 and 1077.

Zbigniew had to leave the country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], who attacked Boles\u0142aw's Poland in 1109. Boles\u0142aw was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see [[Battle of G\u0142og\u00f3w]]). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Boles\u0142aw's other major achievement was the conquest of all of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I's]] [[Pomerania]] (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman]] and completed by Boles\u0142aw around 1123.

He made complex arrangements intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Boles\u0142aw's death, the implementation of the plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Krak\u00f3w and assigned to the special [[Seniorate Province]] that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Boles\u0142aw divided the country into five principalities: [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]], [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], [[Duchy of Masovia|Masovia]], [[Duchy of Sandomierz|Sandomierz]] and [[Seniorate Province|Krak\u00f3w]]. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Krak\u00f3w, was to be added to the senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Krak\u00f3w, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Boles\u0142aw III's sons, when [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]], [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]] and [[Casimir II the Just]] fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Krak\u00f3w.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 104\u2013111\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 104\u2013111</ref>\n\nThe external borders left by Boles\u0142aw III at his death closely resembled the borders left by [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]; this original early Piast monarchy configuration had not survived the fragmentation period.<ref>''Atlas historyczny Polski'' (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, p. 4 and 5</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|right|275 px|[[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]] (late 1240\u20131241) culminated in the [[Battle of Legnica]]]]\n\nFrom the time of the conversion of Poland's ruling elite to Christianity in the 10th century, foreign churchmen had been arriving and the [[culture of medieval Poland|culture of early Medieval Poland]] was developing as a part of European [[Christendom]].  However, it would be a few generations from the time of Mieszko's conversion until significant numbers of native clergymen appeared.

Written [[annals]] began to be generated in the late 10th century; leaders such as Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer were considered literate and educated.  Along with the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' act, the most important written document and source of the period is the ''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'', a chronicle by [[Gallus Anonymus]], a foreign cleric from the court of Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth.

Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western [[Farther Pomerania]] broke its political ties with Poland in the second half of the 12th century and from 1231 became a [[fiefdom|fief]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the [[S\u0142awno]] and [[S\u0142upsk]] areas. [[Pomerelia]] or [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]] granted [[Lubusz Land]] to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the [[Neumark]] and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border.

Those included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, and the knightly class. The work force ranged from hired \"free\" people to [[serfdom|serfs]] attached to the land, to slaves (either purchased, forced into slavery after capture in war or forced into slavery as prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, was able to acquire economic and [[Sovereign immunity|legal immunity]], which it exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction and economic obligations such as taxation that had previously been imposed by the ruling dukes.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n[[File:Toru\u01442017.jpg|thumb|left|250 px |[[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]], established by the [[Teutonic Knights]] became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]]]\n\nCivil strife and foreign invasions, such as the [[Mongol invasions]] in [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|1240/1241]], [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|1259/1260]] and [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|1287/1288]], weakened and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers]]; the early waves from Germany and [[Flanders]] occurred in the 1220s.<ref>[[John Radzilowski]], ''A Traveller's History of Poland''; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-56656-655-X}}, p. 260</ref> The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and [[German town law]]s were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important in the rise of the cities and the establishment of the Polish [[bourgeoisie|burgher]] (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws ([[Magdeburg rights]]) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciates]]) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/><ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201316</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' , p. 366</ref>\n\nIn 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks|W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Laskonogi]]. The titular Duke of Poland promised to provide a \"just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons.\" Such legal guarantees and privileges included the lower level land owners and knights, who were evolving into the lower and middle nobility class known later as ''[[szlachta]]''. The period of fragmentation weakened the rulers and established a permanent trend in Polish history, whereby the rights and role of the nobility were expanded at the monarch's expense.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 116\u2013128\"/>\n\n=== Relations with the Teutonic Knights ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich von Breslau.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Henry IV Probus|Henry IV of Wroc\u0142aw]] in the [[Codex Manesse]], about 1300]]\n\nIn 1226, Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the pagan, Baltic [[Old Prussians]], who lived in a territory adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the [[Old Prussians]] themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including [[Northern Crusades]] sponsored by the papacy. The [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad ([[Che\u0142mno]] Land or [[Kulmerland]]). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and established their own [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state]]. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a [[fiefdom|fief]] and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 128\u2013129\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 128\u2013129</ref><ref>John Radzilowski, ''A Traveller's History of Poland'',  pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\n=== Reunification attempts and the reigns of Przemys\u0142 II and V\u00e1clav II (1232\u20131305) ===\n[[File:Jakub \u015awinka.PNG|thumb|left|185 px|Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]]]]\n\nAs the disadvantages of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various segments of the society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were the activities of the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian dukes]] [[Henry I the Bearded]], his son [[Henry II the Pious]], who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the [[Battle of Legnica]], and [[Henry IV Probus]]. In 1295, [[Przemys\u0142 II]] of [[Greater Poland]] became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Boles\u0142aw II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II of Bohemia]] of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], who married [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland|Przemys\u0142's daughter Richeza]] and became King of Poland in 1300. V\u00e1clav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.\n\n[[File:Catedral de San Juan, Breslavia, Polonia, 2017-12-20, DD 14.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Wroc\u0142aw Cathedral|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]]]\nAn important factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop [[Jakub \u015awinka]] of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed the crowning ceremonies for both Przemys\u0142 II and [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]]. \u015awinka supported [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I \u0141okietek]] at various stages of the duke's career.\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[culture of medieval Poland|Culturally]], the social impact of the Church was considerably broader in the 13th century, as networks of parishes were established and cathedral-type schools became more common.  The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscan]]s were the leading monastic orders at this time, and they interacted closely with the general population. A proliferation of narrative [[annals]] characterized the period, as well as other written records, laws and documents. More of the clergy were of local origin; others were expected to know the Polish language. [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the author of an [[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|influential chronicle]], was the most recognized representative in the intellectual sphere.  ''Perspectiva'', a treatise on [[optics]] by [[Witelo]], a Silesian monk, was one of the finest achievements of [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]]. The construction of churches and castles in the [[Gothic architecture]] style predominated in the 13th century; native elements in art forms were increasingly important, with significant advances taking place in agriculture, manufacturing and crafts.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 141\u2013144\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 141\u2013144</ref>\n\n== 14th century ==\n\n=== The reunited kingdom of the last Piast rulers; Jewish settlement ===\n[[File:W\u0142adys\u0142aw I sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|left|190 px|A fragment of a sandstone [[sarcophagus]] depicting [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] in [[Wawel Cathedral]], Krak\u00f3w]]\n[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]  and his son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III, \"the Great\"]], were the last two rulers of the Piast dynasty of the unified kingdom of Poland of the 14th century.  Their rule was not a return to the Polish state as it existed before the period of fragmentation, because of the loss of internal cohesion and territorial integrity. The regional Piast princes remained strong, and for economic and cultural reasons, some of them gravitated toward Poland's neighbors. The kingdom lost Pomerania and Silesia, the most highly developed and economically important regions of the original ethnically Polish lands, which left half of the Polish population outside the kingdom's borders. The western losses had to do with the failure of the unification efforts undertaken by the [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] dukes and the German expansion processes. These included the Piast principalities developing (or falling into) dependencies in respect to the German political structures, [[Ostsiedlung|settler colonization]] and gradual [[Germanisation|Germanization]] of the Polish ruling circles. The lower [[Vistula]] was controlled by the Teutonic Order. [[Masovia]] was not to be fully incorporated into the Polish state in the near future. Casimir stabilized the western and northern borders, tried to regain some of the lost territories, and partially compensated the losses by new eastern expansion that placed within his kingdom regions that were [[East Slavs|East Slavic]], thus ethnically non-Polish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 15\u201334\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 15\u201334</ref><ref name=\"Wyrozumski 145\u2013154\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 145\u2013154</ref>\n\nDespite the territorial truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced a period of accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy. A great monetary reform was implemented during the reign of Casimir III.<ref name=\"Lukowski 15\u201334\"/><ref name=\"Wyrozumski 145\u2013154\"/>\n\n[[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish settlement]] was taking place in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which specified a broad range of freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements.<ref>Davies, Norman (2005).

When he died as the king of a partially reunited Poland, he left the kingdom in a precarious situation.  Although the area under King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's control was limited and many unresolved issues remained, he may have saved Poland's existence as a state.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nSupported by his ally [[Charles I of Hungary]], W\u0142adys\u0142aw returned from exile and challenged [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav II]] and his successor [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|V\u00e1clav III]] in the period 1304\u20131306. V\u00e1clav III's murder in 1306 terminated the Bohemian P\u0159emyslid dynasty and its involvement in Poland. Afterwards, W\u0142adys\u0142aw  completed the takeover of [[Lesser Poland]], entering Krak\u00f3w, and took the lands north of there, through Kuyavia all the way to [[Pomerelia|Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]]. In 1308, Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state. In a recovery effort, W\u0142adys\u0142aw agreed to ask for help from the Teutonic Knights; the Knights brutally [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)|took over Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] and kept it for themselves.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 155\u2013160\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 155\u2013160</ref>\n\nIn 1311\u20131312, a [[rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert|rebellion in Krak\u00f3w]] instigated by the city's [[patricianship|patrician]] leadership seeking rule by the [[House of Luxembourg]] was put down. This event may have had a limiting impact on the emerging political power of towns.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nIn 1313\u20131314, W\u0142adys\u0142aw conquered [[Greater Poland]]. In 1320, he became the first king of Poland crowned in Krak\u00f3w's [[Wawel Cathedral]] instead of [[Gniezno]]. The coronation was hesitantly agreed to by [[Pope John XXII]] in spite of the opposition of King [[John of Bohemia]], who had also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook an expedition aimed at Krak\u00f3w in 1327, which he was compelled to abort; in 1328, he waged a crusade against Lithuania, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order. The Order was in a state of [[Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1326\u20131332)|war with Poland]] from 1327 to 1332 (see [[Battle of P\u0142owce]]). As a result, the Knights captured [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kujawy]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw was helped by his alliances with Hungary (his daughter [[Elisabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] was married to King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1320) and Lithuania (in a pact of 1325 against the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] and the marriage of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's son [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]] to [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona]], daughter of the Lithuanian ruler [[Gediminas]]).<ref name=\"Chronology 74\u201375\">Ed. Andrzej Chwalba, ''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), pp. 74\u201375, Krzysztof Stopka</ref> After 1329, a peace agreement with Brandenburg also assisted his efforts. A lasting achievement of King [[John of Bohemia]] (and a great loss to Poland) was his success in forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities, often ambivalent about their loyalties, into [[allegiance]] between 1327 and 1329.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 14\u201326</ref>\n\n=== The reign of Casimir III the Great (1333\u20131370) ===\n[[File:Polska 1333 - 1370.png|250px|thumb|left|Poland at the end of the rule of [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] (1370) is shown within the dark red border; [[Silesia]] (yellow) was lost, while the kingdom had expanded to the east]]\n\nAfter the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, the old monarch's 23-year-old son became King Casimir III, later known as [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] (r. 1333\u20131370). Unlike his father, the new king demonstrated no attraction for the hardships of military life.  Casimir's contemporaries did not give him much of a chance of overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a ruler. But from the beginning, Casimir acted prudently, and in 1335, he purchased the claims of King John of Bohemia to the Polish throne.  In 1343, Casimir settled several high-level arbitration disputes with the Teutonic Order by a territorial compromise that culminated in the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz]] of 1343. [[Dobrzy\u0144 Land]] and [[Kuyavia]] were recovered by Casimir. At that time, Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366, Casimir annexed the [[Halych]]\u2013[[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]] [[Galicia-Volhynia|area of Rus']]. The town of [[Lviv]] there attracted newcomers of several nationalities, was granted [[Magdeburg rights|municipal rights]] in 1356, and had thus begun its career as [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]], the main Polish center in the midst of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Hungarian ruling house]] the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 26\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Casimir III of Poland.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Foundation of the [[Collegiate church in Wi\u015blica]] by [[Casimir III the Great]]]]\n\nCasimir, who formally gave up his rights to several [[Silesia]]n principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the [[House of Luxembourg]] (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno Archdiocese]] by Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.\n\nAllied with Denmark and Western Pomerania (Gda\u0144sk Pomerania was granted to the Order as an \"eternal charity\"), Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border. In 1365, [[Drezdenko]] and [[Santok]] became Poland's [[fiefdom|fiefs]], while the [[Wa\u0142cz]] district was taken outright in 1368. The latter action severed the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connected Poland with [[Farther Pomerania]].\n\nCasimir the Great considerably solidified the country's position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Domestically, he integrated and centralized the reunited Polish state and helped develop what was considered the \"[[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]]\": the state within its actual boundaries, as well as past or potential boundaries. Casimir established or strengthened kingdom-wide institutions (such as the powerful state treasury) independent of the regional, class, or royal court-related interests. Internationally, the Polish king was very active diplomatically; he cultivated close contacts with other European rulers and was a staunch defender of the Polish national interest. In 1364, he sponsored the [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w]], in which a number of monarchs participated, which was concerned with the promotion of peaceful cooperation and political balance in Central Europe.\n\n=== The reign of Louis I and Jadwiga (1370\u20131399) ===\n\n[[File:Jadwiga by Bacciarelli.jpg|left|thumb|180 px|[[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] was the great-granddaughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]]]\n[[File:Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel.jpg|Zabudowa Wzg\u00f3rza Wawelskiego (widok z wie\u017cy ko\u015bcio\u0142a Mariackiego); A-7; PL-MA, Krak\u00f3w, Wawel|right|thumb|350 px|[[Wawel Castle]] in [[Krakow]]]]\nImmediately after Casimir's death in 1370, the heirless king's nephew [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Hungary]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual commitment to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir of S\u0142upsk]]), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves; the formal act was negotiated in [[Buda]] in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]]'s sister [[Elizabeth of Poland|Elizabeth]] in Poland as [[regent]]s.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 169\u2013173</ref>\n\nWith the death of Casimir the Great, the period of hereditary (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included the beginning of the [[general sejm]], the dominant bicameral parliament of the future.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|right|Woodcut of Krak\u00f3w from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493]]\n\n\nDuring the reign of Louis I, Poland formed a [[Polish-Hungarian union]]. In the pact of 1374 (the [[Privilege of Koszyce]]), the Polish nobility was granted extensive concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted in the loss of Casimir's territorial gains, including [[Halych]] [[Rus (name)|Rus']], which was recovered by Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband [[Jogaila|Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila)]] forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating [[Lesser Poland]] from [[Greater Poland]], previously granted by King Louis to his [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] ally Duke [[Vladislaus II of Opole|W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Opole]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 42\u201344\">Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', pp. 42\u201344</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian-Polish union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. After Louis's death in 1382 and a power struggle that resulted in the [[Greater Poland Civil War]], the Polish nobility decided that Jadwiga, Louis's youngest daughter, should become the next \"King of Poland\"; Jadwiga arrived in 1384 and was crowned at the age of eleven. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the [[Polish-Lithuanian union|union of Lithuania and Poland]].<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 169\u2013173\"/>\n\n=== Culture ===\nIn the 14th century, many large scale [[Architecture of medieval Poland|brick building projects]] were undertaken during Casimir's reign, including the construction of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents.  The most notable examples of architecture from the medieval period in Poland are the many churches representing the [[Polish Gothic]] style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are best revealed in the furnishings of churches and liturgical items.  Polish law was first codified in the [[Statutes of Casimir the Great]] (the Piotrk\u00f3w\u2013Wi\u015blica Statutes) from 1346\u20131362.  Accordingly, conflict resolution relied on legal proceedings domestically, while bilateral or multilateral negotiations and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. By this time, the network of cathedral and parish schools had become well developed. In 1364, Casimir the Great established the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], the second oldest university in Central Europe. While many still traveled to southern and western Europe for university studies, the [[Old Polish language|Polish language]], along with the predominant [[Latin]], became increasingly more common in written documents. The [[Holy Cross Sermons]] (ca. early 14th century) constitute possibly the oldest extant Polish prose manuscript.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 173\u2013177\">Jerzy Wyrozumski, ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), pp. 173\u2013177</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]\n* [[Culture of medieval Poland]]\n* [[Slavery in Poland]]\n* [[List of Polish monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===Translations and transliterations===\n{{special characters}}{{reflist|group=\"trans\"|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Middle Ages}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poland, Kingdom of, (1025-1385)}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1025]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Poland| ]]\n[[Category:History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]\n[[Category:1025 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1380s disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:14th-century disestablishments in Poland]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c5:5c06:3f00:840b:12e0:2c8:edf", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)"}
