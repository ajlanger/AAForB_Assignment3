Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/10/413273007/its-all-in-your-head-director-pete-docter-gets-emotional-in-inside-out|title=It's All in Your Head: Director Pete Docter Gets Emotional In 'Inside Out'|author=Terry Gross|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/10/413273007/its-all-in-your-head-director-pete-docter-gets-emotional-in-inside-out|title=It's All in Your Head: Director Pete Docter Gets Emotional In 'Inside Out'|author=Terry Gross|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all.

The discussions were held between 2006 and 2009, and Daniels argued that they carried an implied contract for her to be compensated if the ideas were used by Disney. On January 31, 2018, her suit was dismissed by judge [[Philip Gutierrez]], who ruled that since Daniels had released materials related to the project publicly at the time of the conversations, there were no grounds for an implied contract between Disney and Daniels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/law/inside-infringement-case-dismissed-u-s-court-156407.html|title='Inside Out' Infringement Case Dismissed In U.S. Court|author=|date=February 6, 2018|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> Daniels appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], who upheld the District Court's ruling in March 2020 that Pixar's film did not infringe on Daniels' characters.
