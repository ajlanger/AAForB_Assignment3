The serial starts with parallel scenes of the lead characters; Baalaaj (Zain Baig) and Hooriya (Azekah Daniel). Hooriya is a headstrong young girl living in the metropolitan city of Karachi and pursuing quality education. She likes wearing western clothes and rides a bike and is always ready to do any sorts of social work. Baalaaj on the other hand is a feudal boy living in a nearby village, where his uncle Malik Shahbaz is the head of the district. Baalaaj's parents died when he was an infant and was therefore, raised up by his aunt Surraya (Malik Shahbaz's wife). Being under his uncle Malik Shahbaz's supervision, Baalaaj has apparently turned out to be ill-mannered, cruel, with a feudal mindset just like him. He even gave up his studies as education was not valuable for him being the future head of his tribe. Not known to both Baalaaj and Hooriya is that they are engaged since childhood, as Hooriya is the daughter of Malik Shahbaz's younger step-brother Malik Wajahat. \n\nWajahat (Sohail Sameer) fell in love with his college-mate Samreen (Humera Bano) and married her against the wishes of his family. His brother Malik Shahbaz (Jahanzeb Gorchani) has ever since blamed him for this act and does not give him the due recognition and respect which Wajahat deserves being part of the Malik family. In all matters of decision-making, Baalaaj is above Wajahat. Succumbing to his family's pressure, Wajahat had got married for the second time to Saeeda (Natasha Ali), a girl chosen by his brothers, even when he was a father of two daughters with Samreen. It is told that Samreen had left the haveli of her in-laws when Malik Shahbaz got engaged her eldest daughter Hooriya to his nephew Baalaaj when they were just five-year old kids. Not agreeing to this old tradition of early engagements and fearing that Baalaaj will be as orthodox as his uncle and her daughter will be just like other women of this family having no say and respect in their lives, Samreen left her husband with her daughters to live a life of seclusion, where she can give them a better future. Wajahat didn't bring her back for their own betterment but also was not strong enough to go against his brother's decisions. Unknown to his family, Wajahat secretly keeps vigilance of his wife and daughters and sends them financial assistance through his trusted slave Ghulam Din. Samreen has never told her daughters about Hooriya's engagement or about the whereabouts of their paternal family.\n\nHooriya is in love with her childhood friend Danish (Hamza Firdous) who runs a mobile shop. But Danish's mother does not like Hooriya's boldness and extrovertness. Hooriya's mother is also not in favor of Danish as she believes that if his mother does not approve of Hooriya then their marriage will not be successful. \n\nOne day, after Hooriya gives meal to an old street-seller, he is wounded by Baalaaj's speeding vehicle, engaging  him and Hooriya in a verbal brawl. Hooriya makes the wounded man to be put in Baalaaj's car and taken to hospital. In hospital she makes Baalaaj pay all expenses. Baalaaj does this unwillingly and both him and Hooriya curse each other. Hence, from their very first meeting, Baalaaj and Hooriya are not on good terms.\n\nSurraya, called Bi jan (Seemi Pasha) wants her daughter Amber (Maryam Noor) to be married to Baalaaj. Bi jan loves Baalaaj as her own son and considers him as the best match for her daughter. Amber, unlike Baalaaj is continuing her studies and is in love with her class-fellow Faiq (Faraz Farouqi). But she is hesitant to tell about him to his family as Faiq is from middle-class and she knows that her father will never approve his proposal. Malik Shahbaz crowns Baalaaj as the head of the panchayat (ignoring Wajahat) and also commits him to his daughter, thinking that Samreen and her daughters will never come back in their lives, so Baalaaj and Hooriya's engagement is null and void. Baalaaj obediently agrees to this betrothment as his uncle's decision is the final order for him. Amber though very close to Baalaaj as a cousin, is not happy about this engagement. She tells about Faiq to Bi jan, but as expected she rejects it knowing that Malik Shahbaz will never accept a son-in-law from a lesser background. \n\nSeeing her husband's longing for his first wife and daughters, Saeeda one day visits Samreen. She asks her to return, to which Samreen refuses and asks her not to come back again. While leaving Saeeda meets Hooriya and her sister Minhal (Zainab Shabbir). She and Samreen lie to them that Saeeda is an old friend. Saeeda takes their picture for showing it to Wajahat and leaves. When she tells this to Wajahat, his reaction is not what Saeeda expected. He scolds her for interfering in his personal life and warns her not to go near his wife and daughters again. Saeeda once again realizes that only Samreen is Wajahat's love and she can never gain his trust. \n\nOne day Baalaaj and Amber are going home when due to his rash driving Baalaaj splashes water on the nearby walking Hooriya and Minhal. Hooriya as usual looses her temper and shouts at Baalaaj. Baalaaj also in a rage stops the car and gets out. Both recognize each other and start cursing once again. Amber and Minhal stop them from manhandling and they leave. Hence, the successive encounter of Baalaaj and Hooriya's is unfavorable too. \n\nDanish convinces his mother to ask Hooriya's hand in marriage and she does that reluctantly and they get engaged. Amber tells Faiq about her engagement and distances herself from him. Faiq is heart-broken to know that though he loves Amber but cannot get her due to their status difference. Faiq's mother is angry to know that Amber betrayed her son's loyalty by choosing her rich cousin over him. Danish and Faiq's mothers are relatives. They visit Samreen's place and on seeing Minhal, Faiq's mother immediately likes her. They make Faiq and Minhal meet, and Faiq for overcoming Amber's loss, develops interest in Minhal. Amber on the other hand is still in two minds in marrying Baalaaj. She asks Baalaaj to convince her father for delaying their marriage for few months to which he agrees. Amber again approaches Faiq. They both decide to run away. But on the night when Amber is leaving haveli, she is caught by Bi jan. After her mother makes her understand the importance of her background and Baalaaj as her life partner, Amber decides to stay and accepts Baalaaj as her first and last man. Faiq is waiting for her in his car but when she doesn't turn up, he is once again broken on her betrayal. \n\nPreparations start for Baalaaj and Amber's wedding. In city as well, there is a wedding which Hooriya's family is attending. During celebrations there is shooting in air and Samreen gets shot accidentally. Her condition is critical and the sisters don't have enough money for her surgery. Unwillingly, Hooriya calls Ghulam Din for help. On knowing about the accident, Wajahat arrives at the hospital and meets his daughters for the first time in years. Samreen is saved but she goes into comma. Wajahat decides to take his daughters to his haveli as he cannot leave them alone in the city. Hooriya and Minhal arrive at their paternal house on the eve of Baalaaj and Amber's mayun ceremony. Except for Saeeda no one is happy to see them there. On seeing Saeeda, they recognize her and after inquiring from a servant they get to know that she is in fact their step-mother. This makes them angry and initially they misbehave in response to Saeeda's motherly affection, accusing her of stealing their father from them and making their parents separate (none of them know that their mother actually left their father to prevent Baalaaj and Hooriya's marriage).\n\nAmber sees Hooriya and Minhal and recognizes them as the girls with whom Baalaaj had the brawl. Baalaaj and Hooriya also encounter each other and are shocked to learn that they are indeed cousins.\n\nBaalaaj and Hooriya's further meetings are also bloody ones. Once she is dragged by him with the arm for strolling outside the haveli in jeans and without a dupatta. The next time he doesn't allow her to have dinner before their taya has arrived at the table. Hooriya starts to hate this household within the first few days of her arrival, primarily because of Baalaaj's presence and secondly due to the rigid regulations maintained by her taya Malik Shahbaz. \n\nThe main twist occurs in the story when Malik Shahbaz decides to marry Baalaaj to his childhood fiance' Hooriya as she has now returned as part of their family. Being a staunch follower of his traditions, he doesn't even care about his daughter's happiness, who is in the process of becoming Baalaaj's bride, and gives his final decision to wed Baalaaj to his fiance'. Wajahat as before submits to his brother's command and tells his daughters. Both Hooriya and Minhal are shocked to learn about Hooriya's engagement and more shocked to know that their taya has cancelled his own daughter's marriage and instead ordered to get Hooriya married to Baalaaj. Obviously, Hooriya's response is negative. On the other hand Amber is all shattered to know what her parents are doing to her. She retaliates to her mother that she agreed to leave the man she loved for Baalaaj and now how can they take Baalaaj from her. Bi jan is also helpless. Even Baalaaj cannot support Amber as he agreed to marry her only because of his taya's orders otherwise, he never had any emotional feelings for her. Baalaaj confesses to Amber that he hates Hooriya but is doing so only on his taya's orders. Amber is heartbroken.\n\nHooriya and Minhal realize that Saeeda is not pretending to be good to them, in fact she does care for them. She even agrees to help Hooriya out of this turmoil. They make a plan to escape. As a ritual, Hooriya is taken to a shrine before her marriage and from their Saeeda makes them escape. Hooriya is in constant contact with Danish who is waiting for them. As they escape from the shrine, Baalaaj and his men catch them in the bus they are travelling and forcefully take them to a hut and lock them. There Baalaaj beats Hooriya for cursing their taya and takes her mobile away as Danish is calling her, but during all this neither Baalaaj gets to know about Hooriya's engagement to Danish nor that it is Danish to whom Hooriya is in contact with. Finally, Hooriya agrees to marry Baalaaj as he points a gun at Minhal and their Nikah is officiated under force and threat. \n\nThereon, another chapter starts in Baalaaj and Hooriya's life. Both are aggressive towards each other. Hooriya has vowed not to accept him as her husband and is rebellious at all fronts. Baalaaj on the other hand is squeezed between his anger towards Hooriya and his taya's set standards for treating a wife. He initially puts unwanted regulations on her and makes her realize that like every other woman of the haveli she is just equal to his shoes. Yet, Baalaaj maintains a distance from Hooriya, not allowing himself near her without her permission. Despite of Baalaaj and Hooriya's soft and rough skirmishes, both become habitual of each other and Hooriya also appears for her final exams. \n\nFaiq and Minhal get engaged much to Amber's shock that he has come back in her life as her cousin's fiance'. Faiq is still confused for his feelings for Amber but is determined to marry Minhal. Finally Samreen awakens from comma. Hooriya decides to take her to their house and not haveli and asks Wajahat not to tell her about Hooriya and Baalaaj's wedding before she has fully recovered. Much to Baalaaj's disapproval, Hooriya goes to her house. During her absence, Baalaaj develops some feelings for her but is unable to accept them as he recalls his taya's words that a wife is no more than a subordinate.\n\nSamreen is all the time worried about her daughters' marriages. She is keen upon marrying Hooriya and Danish at the earliest. This is not helping Hooriya who does not want to break the news of her marriage to her mother at the moment. One day Danish's mother in a fit of rage tells Samreen about Hooriya's marriage to Baalaaj. This makes Samreen collapse once again as her twenty-year old struggle went in vain. Wajahat then decides to take Samreen to the haveli as Minhal alone cannot look after her. Bi jan convinces Malik Shahbaz and he agrees too. At the haveli, Saeeda attends to Samreen and takes her responsibility. \n\nHooriya tops in her examination. Minhal makes Baalaaj realize that he should also applaud her like everyone else. He brings flower bracelets for her and somehow tells her that he specially bought them for her. Hooriya likes this gesture of his. This is the first time Hooriya feels something for Baalaaj but doesn't realize it herself. \n\nThere is a parallel story of Banu, a servant's daughter. She is in love with Waseem (Ghulam Din's son) but her father has given word of her marriage to an elderly man Qadeer. Qadeer is from rival political party, therefore, keeping their interest safe Malik Shahbaz and Baalaaj agree to marry Banu to him. They lock Banu in a stable. When Hooriya comes to know about this, she first frees Banu from her lock-up and then makes her escape with Waseem to Karachi with Danish's help. By doing this Hooriya feels at peace as she did what she could not do for herself when she was forcefully married to Baalaaj and lost her love. Hooriya confesses this to Bi jan but she does not let Malik Shahbaz know about it. \n\nOne day Baalaaj on taya's orders is going towards their rivals. Hooriya forbids him from taking a gun, once again bringing the subject of her forceful marriage to him under the influence of the same gun. When Baalaaj doesn't listen to her Hooriya angrily leaves the room saying that she does not earn that respect as a wife in his eyes as he brought her in his life forcibly. On hearing this Baalaaj drops the gun and leaves without it. When Hooriya sees it, she feels happy that Baalaaj for the first time agreed to do what she wanted. For the first time she is content about Baalaaj's act.\n\nOn his way, Baalaaj is shot in the arm by his rivals. Hooriya is worried about him being wounded like that. Baalaaj angrily blames her for his condition as she was the one who delayed his departure and not let him take his gun. He refuses to take medicine from her, but Hooriya does not give up and Baalaaj surrenders to her privilege as his wife and takes his medicine. All night long, Hooriya attends to an unconscious Baalaaj like a duty-full wife and tiredly falls asleep at his feet. When Baalaaj wakes up in the morning, he is surprised to find Hooriya near him with first aid. Later-on when Baalaaj asks her whether she is taking care of him because she has developed feelings for him, Hooriya refuses and says that she would have done the same for any other sick person and can never fall in love with him as she will never forget that he forced her to marry him, much to Baalaaj's disappointment. Hooriya then explores her feelings for Baalaaj. She is not able to accept the fact that she is drawing near to him, because the scene of her forced Nikah is still fresh in her memory. She vows in her heart not to love him ever. Yet again, she attends to her duties to the ailing Baalaaj, all the time worrying about him.\n\nBi jan wants to get Minhal married to Faiq at the earliest as Amber is giving her a tough time and she fears that she might ruin Minhal's engagement. Once their wedding date is fixed, Amber is more than outrageous. She has lost both her men to Hooriya and Minhal and plans to avenge them. She tells her father that Hooriya made Banu escape. This makes Malik Shahbaz go mad and orders Hooriya to be locked up in the same place as Banu. Saeeda informs Baalaaj about this and he interferes. He confronts his taya saying that Hooriya is his wife and he cannot let anyone harm her like that as that will be against his manhood. Malik Shahbaz though shocked at this change in Baalaaj, does not say anything more. \n\nHooriya instantly accepts her hidden feelings for Baalaaj, as it was the first time he made her know her importance in his life. She confesses to herself that she has fallen in love with him. Finally, she also admits to Baalaaj that she loves him. Baalaj at first denies his feelings for her but then fails to resist further.\n\nMalik Shahbaz is now regretting his decision of marrying Baalaaj to Hooriya as he sees that she has changed him. Amber takes advantage of this moment and makes her father realize that he is being punished for ruining his daughter's happiness. She further tells him that she likes Faiq and wants to marry him. Malik Shahbaz decides to make Faiq marry Amber instead of Minhal. He makes his men kidnap him and asks him to marry Amber. But on Faiq's refusal he makes a vicious plan. For winning the upcoming elections and for avenging Faiq for his refusal, Malik Shahbaz decides to get Faiq killed for putting the blame on his rival parties, for gaining sympathy votes, as the entire tribe and village knows that Faiq is his future son-in-law. He discusses this with Baalaaj who discourages this idea, saying that Faiq is Minhal's fiance' and an innocent man. On seeing Baalaaj's reluctance, Malik Shahbaz carries out his plan on his own and orders his men to kill Faiq, which Ghulam Din overhears. Thus, one day when Faiq is taking Samreen for her check-up, he is attacked by gunmen. In a struggle, the bullet hits Samreen and she dies. Baalaaj confronts his taya as he realizes that it was his doing. He tells him that from now on he will never participate in his wrongdoings. \n\nAfter Samreen's death, Bi jan and Saeeda decide not to delay Minhal's wedding. Malik Shahbaz cannot stop it as he knows that Baalaaj will interfere. During Danish's condolence call to Hooriya, Amber overhears her and by trick takes his phone number from her mobile. She realizes Danish to be Hooriya's former lover. She convinces him to help her stop Minhal and Faiq's marriage and in return, she will separate Baalaaj and Hooriya so that Danish can have her back in his life. Danish who is still loyal to Hooriya and is not accepting any other woman in his life, agrees to do so. Amber takes Hooriya for shopping and leaves her alone for Danish to interact with her and takes a picture of them. Danish asks Hooriya whether she is happy in her married life, to which she replies in the affirmative and tells him that she loves Baalaaj and drives him away. Danish then calls Baalaaj telling him that his wife loves someone else and is still in contact with him and sends him their picture which Amber took.\n\nBaalaaj gets suspicious. On Hooriya's questioning, he asks her whether she loved someone else. Hooriya in a shock doesn't answer at the moment but then tries to explain it to Baalaaj. But Baalaaj seems to have lost his trust in her and regrets falling in love with her. \n\nThe day of Minhal's mayun comes. Malik Shahbaz asks Bi jan to ask Faiq's mother not to bring him. Faiq is not happy to know this. Amber and Danish have a plan for stopping the ceremony. Once his mother leaves for the haveli, Danish tactfully makes Faiq to go and meet Minhal personally. Amber also convinces Minhal to let Faiq inside her room for a moment and no one shall know. \n\nBaalaaj is still not talking to Hooriya. Minhal removes his misunderstanding by telling him that Danish was their neighbor since their childhood and their mother formally fixed their engagement. She also tells him that now Hooriya only loves him and that he should never leave her or suspect her of not loving him. After this Baalaaj reconciles with Hooriya.\n\nFaiq comes to meet Minhal but is caught in her room. Malik Shahbaz is outrageous and as already does not want Minhal to marry Faiq, calls of their wedding. Amber and Danish are happy on their achievement and Amber thinks that she can get Faiq now. But due to Saeeda's insistence for her daughter's happiness, Malik Shahbaz softens and allows the marriage to proceed as planned, much to Amber's disappointment.\n\nAfter the wedding, Amber is leaving the haveli as she has lost everything. Bi jan tries to stop her but in the struggle she falls down the stairs as Amber pushes her. Bi jan dies and Amber looses her senses realizing that she has caused her mother's death. She is admitted to a mental hospital. Danish now realizing his mistake for ruining Hooriya and Minhal's lives, tells everything to Hooriya for relieving his guilt. Hooriya slashes out at him and warns him of ever coming near her again. Danish under the weight of his guilt commits suicide. \n\nOne day Malik Shahbaz's men see Waseem working in Karachi and inform him. He immediately orders them to kill both Waseem and Banu for going against his orders. Days pass and Hooriya realizes Ghulam Din being absent from his duties. She visits him at his place and he tells her that his son and Banu have been killed on Malik Shahbaz's orders. Hooriya is shattered to know this but the worst comes further as Ghulam Din discloses to her that her taya was behind her mother's murder as well. Hooriya at once confronts her taya and tells him that she will put him behind bars for these murders. Malik Shahbaz asks Baalaaj to control his wife otherwise he will do it himself. Baalaaj gets infuriated and declares war against his taya proclaiming that what he did was wrong and now whatever Hooriya will do, he will support her and between his taya and Hooriya, Baalaaj will stand like a wall. Wajahat overhears all this and squares up his brother for killing his wife. \n\nHooriya calls Baalaaj and tells him that she is about to do something terrible to which Baalaaj gives the nod and joins her at the police station, where Hooriya does a press briefing about Malik Shahbaz's wrongdoings and Baalaaj and Ghulam Din get the FIR taken for the murders.

The serial starts with parallel scenes of the lead characters; Baalaaj (Zain Baig) and Hooriya (Azekah Daniel). Hooriya is a headstrong young girl living in the metropolitan city of Karachi and pursuing quality education. She likes wearing western clothes and rides a bike and is always ready to do any sorts of social work. Baalaaj on the other hand is a feudal boy living in a nearby village, where his uncle Malik Shahbaz is the head of the district. Baalaaj's parents died when he was an infant and was therefore, raised up by his aunt Surraya (Malik Shahbaz's wife). Being under his uncle Malik Shahbaz's supervision, Baalaaj has apparently turned out to be ill-mannered, cruel, with a feudal mindset just like him. He even gave up his studies as education was not valuable for him being the future head of his tribe. Not known to both Baalaaj and Hooriya is that they are engaged since childhood, as Hooriya is the daughter of Malik Shahbaz's younger step-brother Malik Wajahat. \n\nWajahat (Sohail Sameer) fell in love with his college-mate Samreen (Humera Bano) and married her against the wishes of his family. His brother Malik Shahbaz (Jahanzeb Gorchani) has ever since blamed him for this act and does not give him the due recognition and respect which Wajahat deserves being part of the Malik family. In all matters of decision-making, Baalaaj is above Wajahat. Succumbing to his family's pressure, Wajahat had got married for the second time to Saeeda (Natasha Ali), a girl chosen by his brothers, even when he was a father of two daughters with Samreen. It is told that Samreen had left the haveli of her in-laws when Malik Shahbaz got engaged her eldest daughter Hooriya to his nephew Baalaaj when they were just five-year old kids. Not agreeing to this old tradition of early engagements and fearing that Baalaaj will be as orthodox as his uncle and her daughter will be just like other women of this family having no say and respect in their lives, Samreen left her husband with her daughters to live a life of seclusion, where she can give them a better future. Wajahat didn't bring her back for their own betterment but also was not strong enough to go against his brother's decisions. Unknown to his family, Wajahat secretly keeps vigilance of his wife and daughters and sends them financial assistance through his trusted slave Ghulam Din. Samreen has never told her daughters about Hooriya's engagement or about the whereabouts of their paternal family.\n\nHooriya is in love with her childhood friend Danish (Hamza Firdous) who runs a mobile shop. But Danish's mother does not like Hooriya's boldness and extrovertness. Hooriya's mother is also not in favor of Danish as she believes that if his mother does not approve of Hooriya then their marriage will not be successful. \n\nOne day, after Hooriya gives meal to an old street-seller, he is wounded by Baalaaj's speeding vehicle, engaging  him and Hooriya in a verbal brawl. Hooriya makes the wounded man to be put in Baalaaj's car and taken to hospital. In hospital she makes Baalaaj pay all expenses. Baalaaj does this unwillingly and both him and Hooriya curse each other. Hence, from their very first meeting, Baalaaj and Hooriya are are not on good terms.\n\nSurraya, called Bi jan (Seemi Pasha) wants her daughter Amber (Maryam Noor) to be married to Baalaaj. Bi jan loves Baalaaj as her own son and considers him as the best match for her daughter. Amber, unlike Baalaaj is continuing her studies and is in love with her class-fellow Faiq (Faraz Farouqi). But she is hesitant to tell about him to his family as Faiq is from middle-class and she knows that her father will never approve his proposal. Malik Shahbaz crowns Baalaaj as the head of the panchayat (ignoring Wajahat) and also commits him to his daughter, thinking that Samreen and her daughters will never come back in their lives, so Baalaaj and Hooriya's engagement is null and void. Baalaaj obediently agrees to this betrothment as his uncle's decision is the final order for him. Amber though very close to Baalaaj as a cousin, is not happy about this engagement. She tells about Faiq to Bi jan, but as expected she rejects it knowing that Malik Shahbaz will never accept a son-in-law from a lesser background. \n\nSeeing her husband's longing for his first wife and daughters, Saeeda one day visits Samreen. She asks her to return, to which Samreen refuses and asks her not to come back again. While leaving Saeeda meets Hooriya and her sister Minhal (Zainab Shabbir). She and Samreen lie to them that Saeeda is an old friend. Saeeda takes their picture for showing it to Wajahat and leaves. When she tells this to Wajahat, his reaction is not what Saeeda expected. He scolds her for interfering in his personal life and warns her not to go near his wife and daughters again. Saeeda once again realizes that only Samreen is Wajahat's love and she can never gain his trust. \n\nOne day Baalaaj and Amber are going home when due to his rash driving Baalaaj splashes water on the nearby walking Hooriya and Minhal. Hooriya as usual looses her temper and shouts at Baalaaj. Baalaaj also in a rage stops the car and gets out. Both recognize each other and start cursing once again. Amber and Minhal stop them from manhandling and they leave. Hence, the successive encounter of Baalaaj and Hooriya's is unfavorable too. \n\nDanish convinces his mother to ask Hooriya's hand in marriage and she does that reluctantly and they get engaged. Amber tells Faiq about her engagement and distances herself from him. Faiq is heart-broken to know that though he loves Amber but cannot get her due to their status difference. Faiq's mother is angry to know that Amber betrayed her son's loyalty by choosing her rich cousin over him. Danish and Faiq's mothers are relatives. They visit Samreen's place and on seeing Minhal, Faiq's mother immediately likes her. They make Faiq and Minhal meet, and Faiq for overcoming Amber's loss, develops interest in Minhal. Amber on the other hand is still in two minds in marrying Baalaaj. She asks Baalaaj to convince her father for delaying their marriage for few months to which he agrees. Amber again approaches Faiq. They both decide to run away. But on the night when Amber is leaving haveli, she is caught by Bi jan. After her mother makes her understand the importance of her background and Baalaaj as her life partner, Amber decides to stay and accepts Baalaaj as her first and last man. Faiq is waiting for her in his car but when she doesn't turn up, he is once again broken on her betrayal. \n\nPreparations start for Baalaaj and Amber's wedding. In city as well, there is a wedding which Hooriya's family is attending. During celebrations there is shooting in air and Samreen gets shot accidentally. Her condition is critical and the sisters don't have enough money for her surgery. Unwillingly, Hooriya calls Ghulam Din for help. On knowing about the accident, Wajahat arrives at the hospital and meets his daughters for the first time in years. Samreen is saved but she goes into comma. Wajahat decides to take his daughters to his haveli as he cannot leave them alone in the city. Hooriya and Minhal arrive at their paternal house on the eve of Baalaaj and Amber's mayun ceremony. Except for Saeeda no one is happy to see them there. On seeing Saeeda, they recognize her and after inquiring from a servant they get to know that she is in fact their step-mother. This makes them angry and initially they misbehave in response to Saeeda's motherly affection, accusing her of stealing their father from them and making their parents separate (none of them know that their mother actually left their father to prevent Baalaaj and Hooriya's marriage).\n\nAmber sees Hooriya and Minhal and recognizes them as the girls with whom Baalaaj had the brawl. Baalaaj and Hooriya also encounter each other and are shocked to learn that they are indeed cousins.\n\nBaalaaj and Hooriya's further meetings are also bloody ones. Once she is dragged by him with the arm for strolling outside the haveli in jeans and without a dupatta. The next time he doesn't allow her to have dinner before their taya has arrived at the table. Hooriya starts to hate this household within the first few days of her arrival, primarily because of Baalaaj's presence and secondly due to the rigid regulations maintained by her taya Malik Shahbaz. \n\nThe main twist occurs in the story when Malik Shahbaz decides to marry Baalaaj to his childhood fiance' Hooriya as she has now returned as part of their family. Being a staunch follower of his traditions, he doesn't even care about his daughter's happiness, who is in the process of becoming Baalaaj's bride, and gives his final decision to wed Baalaaj to his fiance'. Wajahat as before submits to his brother's command and tells his daughters. Both Hooriya and Minhal are shocked to learn about Hooriya's engagement and more shocked to know that their taya has cancelled his own daughter's marriage and instead ordered to get Hooriya married to Baalaaj. Obviously, Hooriya's response is negative. On the other hand Amber is all shattered to know what her parents are doing to her. She retaliates to her mother that she agreed to leave the man she loved for Baalaaj and now how can they take Baalaaj from her. Bi jan is also helpless. Even Baalaaj cannot support Amber as he agreed to marry her only because of his taya's orders otherwise, he never had any emotional feelings for her. Baalaaj confesses to Amber that he hates Hooriya but is doing so only on his taya's orders. Amber is heartbroken.\n\nHooriya and Minhal realize that Saeeda is not pretending to be good to them, in fact she does care for them. She even agrees to help Hooriya out of this turmoil. They make a plan to escape. As a ritual, Hooriya is taken to a shrine before her marriage and from their Saeeda makes them escape. Hooriya is in constant contact with Danish who is waiting for them. As they escape from the shrine, Baalaaj and his men catch them in the bus they are travelling and forcefully take them to a hut and lock them. There Baalaaj beats Hooriya for cursing their taya and takes her mobile away as Danish is calling her, but during all this neither Baalaaj gets to know about Hooriya's engagement to Danish nor that it is Danish to whom Hooriya is in contact with. Finally, Hooriya agrees to marry Baalaaj as he points a gun at Minhal and their Nikah is officiated under force and threat. \n\nThereon, another chapter starts in Baalaaj and Hooriya's life. Both are aggressive towards each other. Hooriya has vowed not to accept him as her husband and is rebellious at all fronts. Baalaaj on the other hand is squeezed between his anger towards Hooriya and his taya's set standards for treating a wife. He initially puts unwanted regulations on her and makes her realize that like every other woman of the haveli she is just equal to his shoes. Yet, Baalaaj maintains a distance from Hooriya, not allowing himself near her without her permission. Despite of Baalaaj and Hooriya's soft and rough skirmishes, both become habitual of each other and Hooriya also appears for her final exams. \n\nFaiq and Minhal get engaged much to Amber's shock that he has come back in her life as her cousin's fiance'. Faiq is still confused for his feelings for Amber but is determined to marry Minhal. Finally Samreen awakens from comma. Hooriya decides to take her to their house and not haveli and asks Wajahat not to tell her about Hooriya and Baalaaj's wedding before she has fully recovered. Much to Baalaaj's disapproval, Hooriya goes to her house. During her absence, Baalaaj develops some feelings for her but is unable to accept them as he recalls his taya's words that a wife is no more than a subordinate.\n\nSamreen is all the time worried about her daughters' marriages. She is keen upon marrying Hooriya and Danish at the earliest. This is not helping Hooriya who does not want to break the news of her marriage to her mother at the moment. One day Danish's mother in a fit of rage tells Samreen about Hooriya's marriage to Baalaaj. This makes Samreen collapse once again as her twenty-year old struggle went in vain. Wajahat then decides to take Samreen to the haveli as Minhal alone cannot look after her. Bi jan convinces Malik Shahbaz and he agrees too. At the haveli, Saeeda attends to Samreen and takes her responsibility. \n\nHooriya tops in her examination. Minhal makes Baalaaj realize that he should also applaud her like everyone else. He brings flower bracelets for her and somehow tells her that he specially bought them for her. Hooriya likes this gesture of his. This is the first time Hooriya feels something for Baalaaj but doesn't realize it herself. \n\nThere is a parallel story of Banu, a servant's daughter. She is in love with Waseem (Ghulam Din's son) but her father has given word of her marriage to an elderly man Qadeer. Qadeer is from rival political party, therefore, keeping their interest safe Malik Shahbaz and Baalaaj agree to marry Banu to him. They lock Banu in a stable. When Hooriya comes to know about this, she first frees Banu from her lock-up and then makes her escape with Waseem to Karachi with Danish's help. By doing this Hooriya feels at peace as she did what she could not do for herself when she was forcefully married to Baalaaj and lost her love. Hooriya confesses this to Bi jan but she does not let Malik Shahbaz know about it. \n\nOne day Baalaaj on taya's orders is going towards their rivals. Hooriya forbids him from taking a gun, once again bringing the subject of her forceful marriage to him under the influence of the same gun. When Baalaaj doesn't listen to her Hooriya angrily leaves the room saying that she does not earn that respect as a wife in his eyes as he brought her in his life forcibly. On hearing this Baalaaj drops the gun and leaves without it. When Hooriya sees it, she feels happy that Baalaaj for the first time agreed to do what she wanted. For the first time she is content about Baalaaj's act.\n\nOn his way, Baalaaj is shot in the arm by his rivals. Hooriya is worried about him being wounded like that. Baalaaj angrily blames her for his condition as she was the one who delayed his departure and not let him take his gun. He refuses to take medicine from her, but Hooriya does not give up and Baalaaj surrenders to her privilege as his wife and takes his medicine. All night long, Hooriya attends to an unconscious Baalaaj like a duty-full wife and tiredly falls asleep at his feet. When Baalaaj wakes up in the morning, he is surprised to find Hooriya near him with first aid. Later-on when Baalaaj asks her whether she is taking care of him because she has developed feelings for him, Hooriya refuses and says that she would have done the same for any other sick person and can never fall in love with him as she will never forget that he forced her to marry him, much to Baalaaj's disappointment. Hooriya then explores her feelings for Baalaaj. She is not able to accept the fact that she is drawing near to him, because the scene of her forced Nikah is still fresh in her memory. She vows in her heart not to love him ever. Yet again, she attends to her duties to the ailing Baalaaj, all the time worrying about him.\n\nBi jan wants to get Minhal married to Faiq at the earliest as Amber is giving her a tough time and she fears that she might ruin Minhal's engagement. Once their wedding date is fixed, Amber is more than outrageous. She has lost both her men to Hooriya and Minhal and plans to avenge them. She tells her father that Hooriya made Banu escape. This makes Malik Shahbaz go mad and orders Hooriya to be locked up in the same place as Banu. Saeeda informs Baalaaj about this and he interferes. He confronts his taya saying that Hooriya is his wife and he cannot let anyone harm her like that as that will be against his manhood. Malik Shahbaz though shocked at this change in Baalaaj, does not say anything more. \n\nHooriya instantly accepts her hidden feelings for Baalaaj, as it was the first time he made her know her importance in his life. She confesses to herself that she has fallen in love with him. Finally, she also admits to Baalaaj that she loves him. Baalaj at first denies his feelings for her but then fails to resist further.\n\nMalik Shahbaz is now regretting his decision of marrying Baalaaj to Hooriya as he sees that she has changed him. Amber takes advantage of this moment and makes her father realize that he is being punished for ruining his daughter's happiness. She further tells him that she likes Faiq and wants to marry him. Malik Shahbaz decides to make Faiq marry Amber instead of Minhal. He makes his men kidnap him and asks him to marry Amber. But on Faiq's refusal he makes a vicious plan. For winning the upcoming elections and for avenging Faiq for his refusal, Malik Shahbaz decides to get Faiq killed for putting the blame on his rival parties, for gaining sympathy votes, as the entire tribe and village knows that Faiq is his future son-in-law. He discusses this with Baalaaj who discourages this idea, saying that Faiq is Minhal's fiance' and an innocent man. On seeing Baalaaj's reluctance, Malik Shahbaz carries out his plan on his own and orders his men to kill Faiq, which Ghulam Din overhears. Thus, one day when Faiq is taking Samreen for her check-up, he is attacked by gunmen. In a struggle, the bullet hits Samreen and she dies. Baalaaj confronts his taya as he realizes that it was his doing. He tells him that from now on he will never participate in his wrongdoings. \n\nAfter Samreen's death, Bi jan and Saeeda decide not to delay Minhal's wedding. Malik Shahbaz cannot stop it as he knows that Baalaaj will interfere. During Danish's condolence call to Hooriya, Amber overhears her and by trick takes his phone number from her mobile. She realizes Danish to be Hooriya's former lover. She convinces him to help her stop Minhal and Faiq's marriage and in return, she will separate Baalaaj and Hooriya so that Danish can have her back in his life. Danish who is still loyal to Hooriya and is not accepting any other woman in his life, agrees to do so. Amber takes Hooriya for shopping and leaves her alone for Danish to interact with her and takes a picture of them. Danish asks Hooriya whether she is happy in her married life, to which she replies in the affirmative and tells him that she loves Baalaaj and drives him away. Danish then calls Baalaaj telling him that his wife loves someone else and is still in contact with him and sends him their picture which Amber took.\n\nBaalaaj gets suspicious. On Hooriya's questioning, he asks her whether she loved someone else. Hooriya in a shock doesn't answer at the moment but then tries to explain it to Baalaaj. But Baalaaj seems to have lost his trust in her and regrets falling in love with her. \n\nThe day of Minhal's mayun comes. Malik Shahbaz asks Bi jan to ask Faiq's mother not to bring him. Faiq is not happy to know this. Amber and Danish have a plan for stopping the ceremony. Once his mother leaves for the haveli, Danish tactfully makes Faiq to go and meet Minhal personally. Amber also convinces Minhal to let Faiq inside her room for a moment and no one shall know. \n\nBaalaaj is still not talking to Hooriya. Minhal removes his misunderstanding by telling him that Danish was their neighbor since their childhood and their mother formally fixed their engagement. She also tells him that now Hooriya only loves him and that he should never leave her or suspect her of not loving him. After this Baalaaj reconciles with Hooriya.\n\nFaiq comes to meet Minhal but is caught in her room. Malik Shahbaz is outrageous and as already does not want Minhal to marry Faiq, calls of their wedding. Amber and Danish are happy on their achievement and Amber thinks that she can get Faiq now. But due to Saeeda's insistence for her daughter's happiness, Malik Shahbaz softens and allows the marriage to proceed as planned, much to Amber's disappointment.\n\nAfter the wedding, Amber is leaving the haveli as she has lost everything. Bi jan tries to stop her but in the struggle she falls down the stairs as Amber pushes her. Bi jan dies and Amber looses her senses realizing that she has caused her mother's death. She is admitted to a mental hospital. Danish now realizing his mistake for ruining Hooriya and Minhal's lives, tells everything to Hooriya for relieving his guilt. Hooriya slashes out at him and warns him of ever coming near her again. Danish under the weight of his guilt commits suicide. \n\nOne day Malik Shahbaz's men see Waseem working in Karachi and inform him. He immediately orders them to kill both Waseem and Banu for going against his orders. Days pass and Hooriya realizes Ghulam Din being absent from his duties. She visits him at his place and he tells her that his son and Banu have been killed on Malik Shahbaz's orders. Hooriya is shattered to know this but the worst comes further as Ghulam Din discloses to her that her taya was behind her mother's murder as well. Hooriya at once confronts her taya and tells him that she will put him behind bars for these murders. Malik Shahbaz asks Baalaaj to control his wife otherwise he will do it himself. Baalaaj gets infuriated and declares war against his taya proclaiming that what he did was wrong and now whatever Hooriya will do, he will support her and between his taya and Hooriya, Baalaaj will stand like a wall. Wajahat overhears all this and squares up his brother for killing his wife. \n\nHooriya calls Baalaaj and tells him that she is about to do something terrible to which Baalaaj gives the nod and joins her at the police station, where Hooriya does a press briefing about Malik Shahbaz's wrongdoings and Baalaaj and Ghulam Din get the FIR taken for the murders.
