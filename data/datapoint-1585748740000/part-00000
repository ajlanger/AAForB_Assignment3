They compete in the annual [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. England have won the championship on a total of 28 occasions (as well as sharing 10 victories) \u2013 winning the [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] 13 times and the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] 26 times \u2013 making them the most successful outright winners in the tournament's history. {{As of|2019|11|18}}, England are [[IRB World Rankings|ranked]] third in the world by the [[International Rugby Board]]. They are currently the only team from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] to win the [[Rugby World Cup]], having won the tournament in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]], and have been runners-up on three other occasions.<!--DETAILED BELOW-->\n\nThe history of the team extends back to 1871 when the English rugby team played [[1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match|their first official]] [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]], losing 1\u20130 to Scotland. England dominated the early Home Nations Championship (now the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]) which started in 1883. Following the [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|schism]] of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. They first played against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in 1905, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in 1906, and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in 1909. England was one of the teams invited to take part in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and progressed to the final in the second tournament in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], losing 12\u20136 to Australia. Following their Grand Slam in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]], England went on to win the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], defeating Australia 20\u201317 in extra time. They contested the final again in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] in defence of their title, losing 15\u20136 to South Africa, and reached the final for the fourth time in [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], once again losing to South Africa, 32\u201312.\n\nEngland players traditionally wear a white shirt with a rose embroidered on the chest, white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim. England's home ground is [[Twickenham Stadium]] where they first played in 1910. The team is administered by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Four former players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]]; one of these is also a member of the [[IRB Hall of Fame]]. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall \u2013 four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of the England national rugby union team}}\n<!--This is only a SUMMARY of the history of the England team.

The emblem on the jerseys is a red [[rose]]. The strip is manufactured by [[Canterbury of New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the shirt sponsor is [[Telef\u00f3nica O2|O<sub>2</sub>]]. The [[Away colours|away strip]] is usually red or dark grey (described as \"anthracite\"); prior to the introduction of the grey strip, red was the traditional change colour. Navy blue has also been used in the past and was reintroduced for the 2016\u201317 season. Purple was used during the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England [[tracksuit]]s from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The away strip was black for the first time during the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nThe [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) had created the national side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to [[Edinburgh]] to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem.<ref name=\"rose\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s245/st74325.htm |title=England's Rose \u2013 The Official History |date=3 June 2005 |publisher=Unofficial England Rugby Union |accessdate=15 February 2007 }}</ref> The white kit worn by the national team was taken from the kit used at [[Rugby School]].<ref name=\"rose\"/> Alfred Wright, an employee of the Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction.<ref name=\"rose\"/> The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s.<ref name=\"rose\"/> It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.\n\nIn 2003, England first used a skin-tight strip.

The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883 which England won with a [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]]. England have won the title outright 28 times (a record for the tournament) and shared victory ten times. Their longest wait between championships was 18 years (1892\u20131910). During the Six Nations, England also contests the [[Calcutta Cup]] with Scotland (which England first won in 1880) and the [[Millennium Trophy]] with Ireland (which England first won in 1988). The matches between England and France are traditionally known as \"[[Le Crunch]]\".\n{{Six Nations wins}}\n'''Note:''' England are the only team to have won multiple successive grand slams, doing so in 1913\u20131914, 1923\u20131924 and 1991\u20131992 with Wales and France the only other teams to have done so, in 1908\u20131909 for Wales and 1997\u20131998 for France.\n===Rugby World Cup===\n{{Main article|England at the Rugby World Cup}}\n{{England Rugby World Cup record}}\n{{World Rugby Rankings|England|history=yes}}\n<div style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear: right; margin-left: 1em\"> '''IRB World Ranking Leaders'''<br /> {{IRB World Ranking leaders}}</div>\n{{See also|List of England national rugby union team tours and series|List of England national rugby union team matches}}\nEngland have contested every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the tournament began in 1987, reaching the final four times and winning the title in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]].\n\nIn the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural tournament]], England finished second in their pool before losing to Wales in the quarter-finals. They again finished pool runners-up in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] but recovered to beat France in the quarter-finals, and then Scotland in the semi-finals, en route to a 12\u20136 final defeat to Australia at Twickenham on 2 November 1991.\n\nIn [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]], England topped their pool and defeated Australia 25\u201322 at the quarter-final stage before being beaten by the All Blacks in the semi-final. Their [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Third-place play-off|third-place play-off]] match against France was lost 19\u20139.\n\nIn the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 tournament]], England again finished second in their pool. Although they proceeded to win a play-off game against Fiji, they went out of the tournament in the quarter-finals, losing 44\u201321 to South Africa.\n\nEngland came top of their pool in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] and progressed to the final, beating Wales and France in the quarter- and semi-finals. With a drop goal in the last minute of extra time, England won the final 20\u201317 against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003.\n\nEngland made a poor start to their defence of the World Cup in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]], with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy 36\u20130 defeat to South Africa, leaving the title holders on the brink of elimination at the pool stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga ensured that England again reached the knockout stage as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12\u201310 defeat of Australia in the quarter-finals followed by a narrow 14\u20139 victory over the host nation carried England to a second successive final appearance. In the final, held in Paris on 20 October, England lost 15\u20136 to South Africa, their second defeat by the Springboks during the 2007 tournament.\n\nEngland reached the quarter-final stage in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]], losing 19\u201312 to France.\n\nIn [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]], England became the first sole host nation to fail to qualify for the knockout stage, after losing to Wales and Australia in the pool stage.\n\nIn [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], England finished top of their pool before defeating Australia and New Zealand in the knockout stage. On 2 November 2019, they suffered a 32\u201312 final defeat to South Africa in Yokohama, becoming World Cup runners-up for the third time.\n\nEngland's [[Jonny Wilkinson]] is the highest points scorer in the Rugby World Cup, having scored 277 points between 1999 and 2011. England have the fourth most points and the fourth most tries scored in the Rugby World Cup.\n===Overall===\nWhen the [[World Rugby Rankings]] were first introduced in early September 2003, England were ranked 1st; they fell to 2nd for a week in November 2003 before regaining 1st place. They again dropped to 2nd in the rankings, and then to 3rd, from mid-June 2004. Following the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], they fell to 6th in the world rankings, where they remained until moving up to 5th place in December of that year. After a decline in form in 2006, England finished the year ranked 7th; however, they bounced back to 3rd in 2007 due to their good run in that year's [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]], where they finished runners-up. \n\nTheir ranking slipped again in 2008 and during the [[2009 Six Nations Championship]] they dropped to their lowest ranking of 8th, where they remained for the duration of the [[2009 end of year rugby tests|2009 Autumn internationals]]. After a brief resurgence that saw them rise to a ranking of 4th in the world, England again slipped following a poor showing at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] and were ranked 6th in February 2012. The team entered the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] ranked 4th, but after failing to progress beyond the pool stage, England again sank to 8th in the world in November 2015. In March 2016, after securing the Grand Slam in the [[2016 Six Nations Championship]], England rose to second place, where they remained the following year after winning the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]]. A poor fifth-place performance in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] saw them fall to sixth place. \n\nIn October 2019, England defeated New Zealand in the semi-final of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] to top the World Rugby Rankings for the first time since 2004<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/rugby-world-cup-2019-rankings-england-top-15-years-final-vs-south-africa-new-zealand-all-blacks-a9174251.html</ref>.

He was involved in three Five Nations Grand Slams in 1921, 1923 and 1924. Playing as [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]], Wakefield introduced new elements to back row tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He became a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] in 1935, and was knighted in 1944. He became the RFU President in 1950 and following his retirement from politics was awarded the title the first [[Peerage|Baron]] Wakefield of Kendal.<ref name=\"WakefieldIRHF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyhalloffame.com/pages/wakefield1999.htm |title=Wavell Wakefield |publisher=rugbyhalloffame.com |accessdate=14 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914081010/http://www.rugbyhalloffame.com/pages/wakefield1999.htm |archivedate=14 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBetween 1975 and 1982, [[Bill Beaumont]] represented England in 34 Tests.

Later that year, he captained the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] to [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa]] \u2013 the first time an Englishman had captained the Lions since 1930.

He was best known as a superlative leader, motivating England to a remarkable three Grand Slams in five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians FC]]. His playing talents were not as flamboyant as some of his colleagues, but his effectiveness cemented him as a first choice at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]]. It is possible he would already be in the Hall of Fame were it not for outspoken tendencies with respect to the English RFU committee (\"Old Farts\"), who may, as a result, be reluctant to acknowledge his achievements. He was made an [[OBE]] in 1991. Carling is not, however, the youngest England captain of all time; that honour goes to Frederic Stokes, who captained England against Scotland on 27 March 1871 aged just 20 years and 258 days.<ref name=\"EnglandStats2\">{{cite web|url=http://stats.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/records/player/youngest_appearance_captain.html?id=1;type=team |title=International Rugby Union Team Records: Youngest appearance as England captain |website=[[ESPNscrum]] |accessdate=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\nDescribed as arguably \"the greatest forward\" to play for England,<ref name=\"JohnsonIRHF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyhalloffame.com/pages/johnson2005.htm |title=Martin Johnson |publisher=rugbyhalloffame.com |accessdate=14 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909030441/http://www.rugbyhalloffame.com/pages/johnson2005.htm |archivedate=9 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] played 84 Tests for England, and 8 Tests for the British and Irish Lions.<ref name=JohnsonLions>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/pp_martin_johnson.html |title=Lion Legends: Martin Johnson |publisher=British and Irish Lions |accessdate=15 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025014627/http://www.lionsrugby.com/pp_martin_johnson.html|archivedate=25 October 2007}}</ref> He first represented England in 1993, and later that year the Lions.

The IRB recognised them for \"their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played\", specifically stating that they \"are credited with pioneering the passing game and the three-man backline, which became widespread during the 1880s\".<ref name=\"Rotherham-Vassall\"/>\n\nTwo other England internationals, [[John Kendall-Carpenter]] and [[Clive Woodward]], were inducted into the IRB Hall alongside Johnson at the 2011 IRB Awards. Although both had notable careers for England, they were recognised for accomplishments in other roles in the sport. Kendall-Carpenter was cited as one of four key figures in the creation of the Rugby World Cup, whilst Woodward was inducted as coach of the 2003 World Cup winners, alongside all other World Cup-winning coaches from 1987 to 2007.<ref name=\"IRB Hall October 2011\"/>\n\nEngland's most recent inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals [[Alfred St. George Hamersley]] and [[Robert Seddon]], both inducted in 2013.

They compete in the annual [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. England have won the championship on a total of 28 occasions (as well as sharing 10 victories) \u2013 winning the [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] 13 times and the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] 26 times \u2013 making them the most successful outright winners in the tournament's history. {{As of|2019|11|18}}, England are [[IRB World Rankings|ranked]] third in the world by the [[International Rugby Board]]. They are currently the only team from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] to win the [[Rugby World Cup]], having won the tournament in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]], and have been runners-up on three other occasions.<!--DETAILED BELOW-->\n\nThe history of the team extends back to 1871 when the English rugby team played [[1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match|their first official]] [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]], losing 1\u20130 to Scotland. England dominated the early Home Nations Championship (now the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]) which started in 1883. Following the [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|schism]] of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. They first played against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in 1905, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in 1906, and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in 1909. England was one of the teams invited to take part in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and progressed to the final in the second tournament in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], losing 12\u20136 to Australia. Following their Grand Slam in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]], England went on to win the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], defeating Australia 20\u201317 in extra time. They contested the final again in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] in defence of their title, losing 15\u20136 to South Africa, and reached the final for the fourth time in [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], once again losing to South Africa, 32\u201312.\n\nEngland players traditionally wear a white shirt with a rose embroidered on the chest, white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim. England's home ground is [[Twickenham Stadium]] where they first played in 1910. The team is administered by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Four former players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]]; one of these is also a member of the [[IRB Hall of Fame]]. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall \u2013 four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of the England national rugby union team}}\n<!--This is only a SUMMARY of the history of the England team.

The emblem on the jerseys is a red [[rose]]. The strip is manufactured by [[Canterbury of New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the shirt sponsor is [[Telef\u00f3nica O2|O<sub>2</sub>]]. The [[Away colours|away strip]] is usually red or dark grey (described as \"anthracite\"); prior to the introduction of the grey strip, red was the traditional change colour. Navy blue has also been used in the past and was reintroduced for the 2016\u201317 season. Purple was used during the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England [[tracksuit]]s from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The away strip was black for the first time during the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nThe [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) had created the national side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to [[Edinburgh]] to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem.<ref name=\"rose\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s245/st74325.htm |title=England's Rose \u2013 The Official History |date=3 June 2005 |publisher=Unofficial England Rugby Union |accessdate=15 February 2007 }}</ref> The white kit worn by the national team was taken from the kit used at [[Rugby School]].<ref name=\"rose\"/> Alfred Wright, an employee of the Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction.<ref name=\"rose\"/> The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s.<ref name=\"rose\"/> It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.\n\nIn 2003, England first used a skin-tight strip.

The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883 which England won with a [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]]. England have won the title outright 28 times (a record for the tournament) and shared victory ten times. Their longest wait between championships was 18 years (1892\u20131910). During the Six Nations, England also contests the [[Calcutta Cup]] with Scotland (which England first won in 1880) and the [[Millennium Trophy]] with Ireland (which England first won in 1988). The matches between England and France are traditionally known as \"[[Le Crunch]]\".\n{{Six Nations wins}}\n'''Note:''' England are the only team to have won multiple successive grand slams, doing so in 1913\u20131914, 1923\u20131924 and 1991\u20131992 with Wales and France the only other teams to have done so, in 1908\u20131909 for Wales and 1997\u20131998 for France.\n===Rugby World Cup===\n{{Main article|England at the Rugby World Cup}}\n{{England Rugby World Cup record}}\n{{World Rugby Rankings|England|history=yes}}\n<div style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear: right; margin-left: 1em\"> '''IRB World Ranking Leaders'''<br /> {{IRB World Ranking leaders}}</div>\n{{See also|List of England national rugby union team tours and series|List of England national rugby union team matches}}\nEngland have contested every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the tournament began in 1987, reaching the final four times and winning the title in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]].\n\nIn the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural tournament]], England finished second in their pool before losing to Wales in the quarter-finals. They again finished pool runners-up in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] but recovered to beat France in the quarter-finals, and then Scotland in the semi-finals, en route to a 12\u20136 final defeat to Australia at Twickenham on 2 November 1991.\n\nIn [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]], England topped their pool and defeated Australia 25\u201322 at the quarter-final stage before being beaten by the All Blacks in the semi-final. Their [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Third-place play-off|third-place play-off]] match against France was lost 19\u20139.\n\nIn the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 tournament]], England again finished second in their pool. Although they proceeded to win a play-off game against Fiji, they went out of the tournament in the quarter-finals, losing 44\u201321 to South Africa.\n\nEngland came top of their pool in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] and progressed to the final, beating Wales and France in the quarter- and semi-finals. With a drop goal in the last minute of extra time, England won the final 20\u201317 against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003.\n\nEngland made a poor start to their defence of the World Cup in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]], with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy 36\u20130 defeat to South Africa, leaving the title holders on the brink of elimination at the pool stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga ensured that England again reached the knockout stage as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12\u201310 defeat of Australia in the quarter-finals followed by a narrow 14\u20139 victory over the host nation carried England to a second successive final appearance. In the final, held in Paris on 20 October, England lost 15\u20136 to South Africa, their second defeat by the Springboks during the 2007 tournament.\n\nEngland reached the quarter-final stage in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]], losing 19\u201312 to France.\n\nIn [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]], England became the first sole host nation to fail to qualify for the knockout stage, after losing to Wales and Australia in the pool stage.\n\nIn [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], England finished top of their pool before defeating Australia and New Zealand in the knockout stage. On 2 November 2019, they suffered a 32\u201312 final defeat to South Africa in Yokohama, becoming World Cup runners-up for the third time.\n\nEngland's [[Jonny Wilkinson]] is the highest points scorer in the Rugby World Cup, having scored 277 points between 1999 and 2011. England have the fourth most points and the fourth most tries scored in the Rugby World Cup.\n===Overall===\nWhen the [[World Rugby Rankings]] were first introduced in early September 2003, England were ranked 1st; they fell to 2nd for a week in November 2003 before regaining 1st place. They again dropped to 2nd in the rankings, and then to 3rd, from mid-June 2004. Following the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], they fell to 6th in the world rankings, where they remained until moving up to 5th place in December of that year. After a decline in form in 2006, England finished the year ranked 7th; however, they bounced back to 3rd in 2007 due to their good run in that year's [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]], where they finished runners-up. \n\nTheir ranking slipped again in 2008 and during the [[2009 Six Nations Championship]] they dropped to their lowest ranking of 8th, where they remained for the duration of the [[2009 end of year rugby tests|2009 Autumn internationals]]. After a brief resurgence that saw them rise to a ranking of 4th in the world, England again slipped following a poor showing at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] and were ranked 6th in February 2012. The team entered the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] ranked 4th, but after failing to progress beyond the pool stage, England again sank to 8th in the world in November 2015. In March 2016, after securing the Grand Slam in the [[2016 Six Nations Championship]], England rose to second place, where they remained the following year after winning the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]]. A poor fifth-place performance in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] saw them fall to sixth place. \n\nIn October 2019, England defeated New Zealand in the semi-final of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] to top the World Rugby Rankings for the first time since 2004<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/rugby-world-cup-2019-rankings-england-top-15-years-final-vs-south-africa-new-zealand-all-blacks-a9174251.html</ref>.

Playing as [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]], Wakefield introduced new elements to back row tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He became a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] in 1935, and was knighted in 1944.

Later that year, he captained the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] to [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa]] \u2013 the first time an Englishman had captained the Lions since 1930.

He was best known as a superlative leader, motivating England to a remarkable three Grand Slams in five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians FC]]. His playing talents were not as flamboyant as some of his colleagues, but his effectiveness cemented him as a first choice at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]]. It is possible he would already be in the Hall of Fame were it not for outspoken tendencies with respect to the English RFU committee (\"Old Farts\"), who may, as a result, be reluctant to acknowledge his achievements. He was made an [[OBE]] in 1991.

The IRB recognised them for \"their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played\", specifically stating that they \"are credited with pioneering the passing game and the three-man backline, which became widespread during the 1880s\".<ref name=\"Rotherham-Vassall\"/>\n\nTwo other England internationals, [[John Kendall-Carpenter]] and [[Clive Woodward]], were inducted into the IRB Hall alongside Johnson at the 2011 IRB Awards. Although both had notable careers for England, they were recognised for accomplishments in other roles in the sport. Kendall-Carpenter was cited as one of four key figures in the creation of the Rugby World Cup, whilst Woodward was inducted as coach of the 2003 World Cup winners, alongside all other World Cup-winning coaches from 1987 to 2007.<ref name=\"IRB Hall October 2011\"/>\n\nEngland's most recent inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals [[Alfred St. George Hamersley]] and [[Robert Seddon]], both inducted in 2013.
