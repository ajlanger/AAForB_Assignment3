{"title_page": "The Waltz of the Toreadors", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The Waltz of the Toreadors''''' (''La Valse des tor\u00e9adors'') is a 1951 play by [[Jean Anouilh]].\n\n==Plot==\nThis bitter farce is set in 1910 France and focuses on General L\u00e9on Saint-P\u00e9 and his infatuation with Ghislaine, a woman with whom he danced at a garrison ball some 17 years earlier. Because of the General's commitment to his marriage, the couple's love remained unconsummated. Now faced by the reality of retirement with his hypochondriac wife, the General finds himself lost in fond memories of his old flirtation. When Ghislaine suddenly reappears, he is delighted \u2014 until he finds himself competing for her hand with a considerably younger suitor.\n\n==Background==\nThe General and his mad wife had previously appeared in Anouilh's 1948 play ''[[Ard\u00e8le ou la Marguerite]]'', and a further variant on the character appeared in the 1958 comedy ''L'Hurluberlu, ou le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux''. By the time of Anouilh's last play, ''Le Nombril'' (1981), L\u00e9on St P\u00e9 had transformed into a grouchy and unfashionable old playwright obviously intended by Anouilh as a cynical self-portrait.\n\n==Stage productions==\n''The Waltz of the Toreadors'' premiered in Paris at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es on 8 January 1952, with Claude Sainval and Marie Ventura in the leading roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regietheatrale.com/index/index/programmes/programmes.php?recordID=133&La |title=Programmes originaux de th\u00e9\u00e2tre - La Valse des Tor\u00e9adors de Jean ANOUILH - Com\u00e9die des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es 1952 |publisher=Regietheatrale.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref> Four years later, it premiered in [[London]] in an English translation by Lucienne Hill.
