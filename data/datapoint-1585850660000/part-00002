{"title_page": "The Turkish harpist (Manuchehri)", "text_new": "{{short description|11th-century poem by Manuchehri}}\n'''Manuchehri's Turkish harpist''' is a poem by the 11th-century Persian royal court poet [[Manuchehri]]. It is also known as {{lang|fa-Latn|Dar mahd-e Espahbad Man\u016bchehr ebn-e Q\u0101b\u016bs}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0633\u067e\u0647\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0633}}) \"In praise of the Espahbad Manuchehr son of Qabus\", or [[Qasida]] no. 39 in the collected works of Manuchehri.<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ Qasida 39] (Ganjoor website).</ref>\n\nThe poem is a ''[[qasida|qas\u012bda]]'' (praise poem) in the Arabic style, consisting of 30 or 31 verses,<ref>Kazimirski's text omits verse 13.</ref> all with the same rhyme. The first ten lines praise the beauty and skill of a harpist who is playing at the autumn festival of Mehrgan. Lines 11\u201316 describe the fierceness and warlike qualities of Manuchehr, to whom the poem is addressed, and lines 17\u201323 describe the ruler's splendid war horse. The poet goes on to encourage Manuchehr to enjoy the feast and ends with a prayer that his career will continue to be successful and glorious.\n\nThe poem is notable for its musical rhymes, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang \u010dang ... sang sang ... tang tang}}, which imitate the thrumming of the harp (''[[chang (instrument)|chang]]'') and play on different meanings of the words. As with many of Manuchehri's poems he expresses his delight in the feast and the joys of life.<ref>Cf. Shokrpour et al (2014).</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nManuchehri's patron, after whom he took his pen-name Manuchehri, [[Manuchihr|Manuchehr]] son of Qabus, was ruler of the region of [[Tabaristan]], also known as [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], on the south side of the Caspian Sea. Manuchehr was not completely independent, but was a vassal of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (d. 1030). The title Espahbad or Espahbod was given to an army commander or minor ruler not directly appointed by the Sultan, but who was a vassal like Manuchehr or his father.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 360.</ref> The title goes back to pre-Islamic times.<ref>Browne (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n\nManuchehr died c. 1030, so the poem was evidently written therefore before this date. Sometime after Manuchehr's death, Manuchehri migrated to [[Ghazni]] (in present day Afghanistan) where be became a court poet to Mahmud's son, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].\n\nThe poem was written to celebrate [[Mehregan|Mehrg\u0101n]] (also pronounced Mehreg\u0101n or Mehrag\u0101n), an autumn festival dating back to pre-Islamic times which is held 195 days after the spring festival of [[Nowruz]].\n\n==Sex of the harpist==\nThe sex of the harpist is not completely clear. Although harpists were often illustrated as female, yet the instrument was also played by men: both [[Rudaki]]<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref> and Manuchehri's contemporary [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] are said to have been excellent harpists.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 124.</ref> It was possible for the same person to be both a soldier and to play the harp, as this verse of Farrokhi, in another ''qasida'' using the rhyme ''-ang'' and playing on the two meanings of {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u010dang}}, makes clear:<ref>Quoted by EIr (2004); cf.

The transcription shows the modern Iranian pronunciation. The letter ''x'' is used for ''kh'' (as in Khayyam), ''q'' for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop. \n\nThe metre of the poem is known as ''ramal''; in Elwell-Sutton's classification 2.4.15 (see [[Persian metres]]). In most lines there is a break or ''[[caesura]]'' after the 7th syllable, but in some lines the break is after the 8th or 6th. The pattern is as follows (\u2013 = long syllable, u = short syllable):\n: \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013\n\nOverlong syllables (which take up the

several meanings: (1) a harp; (2) a hand with fingers bent; (3) anything crooked or bent; (4) the talon of a bird or claws of a wild animal; (5) a person crippled in hand or foot.<ref>\u0654F.

In modern times it is defined as a distance of 6 km (about 3.7 miles), but in the past it varied with the terrain.

Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=330 page 330].</ref> These include (1) narrow, straight, tight; (2) a horse-girth or strap for fastening on a load; (3) half a load (as much as is carried upon one side of an animal). \n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|bartang}} is the upper strap or over-strap used for tying on a load.\n\nThe harp is seen metaphorically as a horse which the player is riding. The strings of a harp were often made of horsehair. \"Since harp strings were usually made of horsehair, Man\u016b\u010dehr\u012b likens a harp to a horse \u201cwith its head up and its mane down\u201d.<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref>.\n\n===Verse 4===\nIt is a frequent metaphor of Persian love poetry that the curly locks ({{lang|fa-Latn|zolf}}) of the beloved keep the lover in bondage.<ref>J.

Kazimirski suggests that it means that \"an Ethiopian (a race known to be constantly joyful) has put his hand in the harpist's and is moving it so rapidly over the instrument that the hands appear to be invisible, as if they have been cut off.\" However, this is not certain.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|Zang\u012b}} is the word generally used in Persian poetry for a negro or black man. It is also chosen here for its rhyme with {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}.\n\n===Verse 7===\n[[R\u00fbm|R\u016bm]] was the name given to the remnant of the former Roman empire (by this time Greek-speaking) in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), hence {{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm\u012b}} means \"Greek\" or from Asia Minor.

It is also known as {{lang|fa-Latn|Dar mahd-e Espahbad Man\u016bchehr ebn-e Q\u0101b\u016bs}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0633\u067e\u0647\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0633}}) \"In praise of the Espahbad Manuchehr son of Qabus\", or [[Qasida]] no. 39 in the collected works of Manuchehri.<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ Qasida 39] (Ganjoor website).</ref>\n\nThe poem is a ''[[qasida|qas\u012bda]]'' (praise poem) in the Arabic style, consisting of 30 or 31 verses,<ref>Kazimirski's text omits verse 13.</ref> all with the same rhyme. The first ten lines praise the beauty and skill of a harpist who is playing at the autumn festival of Mehrgan. Lines 11\u201316 describe the fierceness and warlike qualities of Manuchehr, to whom the poem is addressed, and lines 17\u201323 describe the ruler's splendid war horse. The poet goes on to encourage Manuchehr to enjoy the feast and ends with a prayer that his career will continue to be successful and glorious.\n\nThe poem is notable for its musical rhymes, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang \u010dang ... sang sang ... tang tang}}, which imitate the thrumming of the harp (''[[chang (instrument)|chang]]'') and play on different meanings of the words. As with many of Manuchehri's poems he expresses his delight in the feast and the joys of life.<ref>Cf. Shokrpour et al (2014).</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nManuchehri's patron, after whom he took his pen-name Manuchehri, [[Manuchihr|Manuchehr]] son of Qabus, was ruler of the region of [[Tabaristan]], also known as [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], on the south side of the Caspian Sea. Manuchehr was not completely independent, but was a vassal of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (d. 1030). The title Espahbad or Espahbod was given to an army commander or minor ruler not directly appointed by the Sultan, but who was a vassal like Manuchehr or his father.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 360.</ref> The title goes back to pre-Islamic times.<ref>Browne (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n\nManuchehr died c. 1030, so the poem was evidently written therefore before this date. Sometime after Manuchehr's death, Manuchehri migrated to [[Ghazni]] (in present day Afghanistan) where be became a court poet to Mahmud's son, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].\n\nThe poem was written to celebrate the autumn festival of [[Mehregan|Mehrg\u0101n]] (also pronounced Mehreg\u0101n or Mehrag\u0101n), a festival dating back to pre-Islamic times which is held 195 days after the spring festival of [[Nowruz]].\n\n==Sex of the harpist==\nThe sex of the harpist is not completely clear. Although harpists were often illustrated as female, yet the instrument was also played by men: both [[Rudaki]]<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref> and Manuchehri's contemporary [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] are said to have been excellent harpists.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 124.</ref> It was possible for the same person to be both a soldier and to play the harp, as this verse of Farrokhi, in another ''qasida'' using the rhyme ''-ang'' and playing on the two meanings of {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u010dang}}, makes clear:<ref>Quoted by EIr (2004); cf.

The letter ''x'' is used for ''kh'' (as in Khayyam), ''q'' for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop. \n\nThe metre of the poem is known as ''ramal''; in Elwell-Sutton's classification 2.4.15 (see [[Persian metres]]). In most lines there is a break or ''[[caesura]]'' after the 7th syllable, but in some lines the break is after the 8th or 6th. The pattern is as follows (\u2013 = long syllable, u = short syllable):\n: \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013\n\nOverlong syllables (which take up the

several meanings: (1) a harp; (2) a hand with fingers bent; (3) anything crooked or bent; (4) the talon of a bird or claws of a wild animal; (5) a person crippled in hand or foot.<ref>\u0654F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=400 p. 400].</ref>\n\nKazimirski translates {{lang|fa-Latn|sang}} (literally, a stone) as \"the stone which weighs on the heart\" and \"the burden of his griefs ({{lang|fr|le fardeau de ses chagrins}})\".<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The author of EIr (2004) translates it as \"self-restraint\".\n\nA ''[[parasang|farsang]]'', which Ancient Greek authors called a parasang, is a unit equivalent to the distance travelled in an hour, still used today. In modern times it is defined as a distance of 6 km (about 3.7 miles), but in the past it varied with the terrain. The European equivalent was the [[league (unit)|league]].\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe word {{lang|fa-Latn|tang}} also has several meanings.<ref>F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=330 page 330].</ref> These include (1) narrow, straight, tight; (2) a horse-girth or strap for fastening on a load; (3) half a load (as much as is carried upon one side of an animal). \n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|bartang}} is the upper strap or over-strap used for tying on a load.\n\nThe harp is seen metaphorically as a horse which the player is riding. The strings of a harp were often made of horsehair. \"Since harp strings were usually made of horsehair, Man\u016b\u010dehr\u012b likens a harp to a horse \u201cwith its head up and its mane down\u201d.<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref>.\n\n===Verse 4===\nIt is a frequent metaphor of Persian love poetry that the curly locks ({{lang|fa-Latn|zolf}}) of the beloved keep the lover in bondage.<ref>J. T. P. de Bruijn (1989), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/beloved \"Beloved\"]. ''Encyclopaedia Iranica online''.</ref> Boys as well as girls had long locks. E. G. Browne relates a story of how Sultan Mahmud cut off the locks of his favourite slave boy Ayaz when drunk and was in a very bad mood the following day.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 38.</ref>\n\n===Verse 5===\nThe meaning of this verse is obscure. Kazimirski suggests that it means that \"an Ethiopian (a race known to be constantly joyful) has put his hand in the harpist's and is moving it so rapidly over the instrument that the hands appear to be invisible, as if they have been cut off.\" However, this is not certain.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|Zang\u012b}} is the word generally used in Persian poetry for a negro or black man. It is also chosen here for its rhyme with {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}.\n\n===Verse 7===\n[[R\u00fbm|R\u016bm]] was the name given to the remnant of the former Roman empire (by this time Greek-speaking) in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), hence {{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm\u012b}} means \"Greek\" or from Asia Minor. In the Middle Ages, the brocades woven by [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] weavers were famous. (See [[Brocade#Byzantium]].)\n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|B\u0101drang}} is a citrus fruit or orange, such as even today commonly grows in Mazandaran Province;<ref>Dehkhoda [http://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%86%DA%AF-3 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0646\u06af]</ref><ref>H. Sadeghi, A. Ghanbari (2011), [https://www.actahort.org/books/903/903_162.htm Survey of damage of citrus in the Mazandaran Region of Iran following the January 2008].</ref> it is also a kind of cucumber.\n\n===Verse 8===\n[[Mehregan]] is a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] autumn festival which at this period was celebrated as widely as Now Ruz, but later, after the Mongol invasions (13th century), became less popular. It was particularly associated with the Zoroastrians. At this time the Zoroastrian religion still had many followers in the Caspian Sea provinces.<ref>Browne (1906), vol 2., p. 114.</ref>\n\n===Verse 9===\nKazimirski translates {{lang|fa-Latn|row\u0161an \u010do rang}} as \"shining like blood\". However, \"blood\" is not one of the meanings given for {{lang|fa-Latn|rang}} in Steingass's dictionary. Dehkhoda's dictionary quotes this verse as an example of the meaning \"rays of the sun\".<ref>Dehkhoda, ''Loqatn\u0101me'', [http://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D8%B2%D9%86%DA%AF \"\u0632\u0646\u06af\".]</ref>\n\n===Verse 10===\n[[Fereydun|Fereidun]] was a mythical ancient Iranian king, whose life is described in Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]]. He is said to have ruled for 500 years.\n\nAzar in the Iranian calendar is the last month of autumn, corresponding to October\u2013November. There is a play of words here between {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0100zar}} and {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101z(a)rang}} \"distress, sorrow, misery\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Manuchehri]]\n* [[Chang (instrument)]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Browne, E.
