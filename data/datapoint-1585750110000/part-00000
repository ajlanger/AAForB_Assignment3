E. Cummings|E.E. Cummings]]. ''Him'' has been called a precursor to [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. The play was first published in November 1927 and premiered in New York during the spring of 1928. ''Him'' is sometimes called a precursor to [[Theatre of the Absurd]] but has also been described as being [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] and in the [[German Expressionism|German expressionist]] tradition. It is heavily influenced by Freudian psychology as well as popular culture of the 1920s.\n\n== Background ==\nCummings wrote him in Paris and New York. He said of ''Him'', that \u201cthe book was probably published soon after the play had finished itself.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Maker: E. E.

E. Cummings|E.E. Cummings]]. ''Him'' has been called a precursor to [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. The play was first published in November 1927 and premiered in New York during the spring of 1928. ''Him'' is sometimes called a precursor to [[Theatre of the Absurd]] but has also been described as being [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] and in the [[German Expressionism|German expressionist]] tradition. It is heavily influenced by Freudian psychology as well as popular culture of the 1920s.\n\n== Background ==\nCummings wrote him in Paris and New York.

Him's act of creating a play is also a birth of sorts.\n\n==== Art ====\nHim describes the artist as \"a human being who balances three chairs, one on top of another, on a wire, eighty feet in air with no net underneath, and then climbs into the top chair, sits down, and begins to swing....\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cummings, E.
