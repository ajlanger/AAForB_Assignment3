Howmet also provides [[hot isostatic pressing]], titanium ingots and protective coating services.\n\nHowmet operates 27 facilities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[France]], the [[UK]], [[Hungary]] and [[Japan]].\n\n==History==\nHowmet's roots can be traced back to 1926 with the founding of Austenal, a company which manufactured raw materials and process for dental appliances. Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co. (MISCO), which provided the monolithic shell process, which uses a ceramic shell with thin, strong walls to increase control of the solidification process to produce a sounder [[casting]].\n\nHowe became Howmet in 1965, marking a transition from a mining company to a manufacturer of precision metal products. Howmet was purchased in 1975 by [[Pechiney]], a multinational aluminum company. In 1989, Pechiney purchased the Cercast group of companies, bringing Howmet into the aluminum casting industry.\n\nIn 1995, Pechiney sold Howmet to a joint venture between [[Thiokol]] and [[The Carlyle Group]]. By late 1997 the ownership structure of Howmet had morphed into a distribution of Thiokol owning 62%, Carlyle 23%, and the public 15%. Thiokol later in 1998 changed its name to Cordant Technologies Inc. By February 1999, Cordant had acquired an 84.7% stake in Howmet.\n\nIn 2000, Cordant sold its stake in Howmet Corp. to [[Alcoa]], which merged Howmet into its Alcoa Industrial Components unit. In 2004, Howmet was merged to form the Alcoa Investment Casting and Forged Products unit. In 2007, Howmet was renamed Alcoa Howmet as a division of the newly formed Alcoa Power and Propulsion unit.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. spun off its bauxite, alumina, and aluminum operations to a new company called Alcoa Corp. Alcoa Inc. was renamed Arconic Inc., and retained the operations in aluminum rolling (excluding the Warrick operations), aluminum plate, precision castings, and aerospace and industrial fasteners.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, Howmet was separated from [[Arconic]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2020/03/31/arconic-completes-split-into-two-companies.html | title=Arconic completes split into two companies | first=Julia | last=Mericle | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Locations==\n* Acuna, Mexico\n* [[Branford, Connecticut]]\n* [[Cleveland, OH]]\n* [[Dives-sur-Mer]], France\n* [[Dover, New Jersey]] - (2)\n* [[\u00e9vron|Evron]], France\n* Exeter, UK - (2)\n* [[Gennevilliers]], France\n* [[Georgetown, Ontario]]\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]]\n* [[La Porte, Indiana]]\n* [[Laval, Quebec]]\n* [[Morristown, Tennessee]]\n* [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Hungary\n* Nomi, Japan\n* [[Whitehall, Michigan]] - (6)\n* [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]\n* [[Winsted, Connecticut]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Howmet TX]] - Howmet-backed turbine race car.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.howmet.com}}\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Howmet Aerospace Inc.\n| google    = HWM\n| yahoo     = HWM\n| bloomberg = HWM:US\n| symbol    = HWM\n| sec_cik   = HWM\n}}\n\n{{Alcoa}}\n[[Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Arconic]]\n[[Category:Aerospace companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Alcoa]]\n[[Category:Howmet Aerospace]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American industrial company}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = Howmet Aerospace Inc.\n| type                = [[Public company]]\n| traded_as           = {{New York Stock Exchange|HWM}}<BR>[[S&P 500 Index]] component\n| industry            = Manufacturing\n| founded             = \n| hq_location         = [[Whitehall, Michigan]], U.S.\n| key_people          = John C.
