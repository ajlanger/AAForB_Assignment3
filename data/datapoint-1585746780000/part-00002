It is bounded by the [[Okavango River]] to the west and the [[Kwando River]] to the east. [[Angola]] lies to the north and [[Botswana]] to the south.\n\nThe area is an important migration route from Botswana to Angola for [[African elephant]] and some other game species. It is an unusual Protected Area as about 5,500 people live in the park. The Namibian government involves park residents and neighbours in planning and managing the park.<ref name=MoE/>\n\n== History ==\nThe area was first proclaimed as Caprivi Nature Park in 1963. It became the Caprivi Game Reserve in 1966 and upgraded to the Caprivi Game Park in 1968. The [[South African Defence Force]] occupied it during Namibia\u2019s [[Namibian War of Independence|war of liberation]]. Conservation officials were not permitted to enter or manage the park due to military operations.\n\nThe Defence Force left the area shortly before Namibia obtained Independence from [[South Africa]] in 1990. The Namibian Government commissioned a study to assess the [[fauna]] and [[flora]] and developed plans to accommodate both [[biodiversity]] protection and the 5,500 park residents.\n\nMahango Game Reserve, to the west of the Park, was proclaimed in 1989. The Caprivi Game Park, Mahango Game Reserve and an unproclaimed area along the [[Cuando River]] were united to become Bwabwata National Park in 2007.\n\nThe wreckage of [[LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470]] was found in the park in November 2013.<ref name=\"Reuters\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/30/us-mozambique-flight-idUSBRE9AT02920131130 |title=Mozambique Airlines plane crashes in Namibia, killing 33 |publisher=Reuters|date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Geography and access ==\nThe park is 40&nbsp;km north to south and 190&nbsp;km from west to east.  Bwabwata is situated in the Caprivi and Kavango regions, extending along the Caprivi Strip. It is bounded by the [[Okavango River]] to the west and the Kwando River to the east. Angola lies to the north and Botswana to the south.\n\nThe main road between the towns of [[Rundu]] and [[Katima Mulilo]], the [[Trans-Caprivi Highway]] ([[B8 road (Namibia)|B8]]), runs through Bwabwata, linking Namibia to Botswana, [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. A minor road (C48) dissects Mahango in a north-south direction and connects Namibia to Botswana.\n\nAt either end of the Park are small settlements \u2013 [[Kongola]] in the east and [[Divundu]] in the west. \n\nThe park is largely unfenced but the southern boundary with Botswana has three veterinary standard fences. These prevent the spread of cattle diseases, such as [[Foot-and-mouth disease]].\n\n== Biology and ecology ==\nBwabwata is located in the Tree and Shrub [[Savanna]] biome. Vegetation types include North-eastern Kalahari Woodland, Caprivi Mopane Woodland, Riverine Woodlands and Islands, Okavango Valley, Caprivi Floodplains. The landscape consists of low vegetated sand dunes with old drainage lines ([[Omuramba|''Omiramba'']]) in between. \n\nBwabwata forms a crucial trans-boundary link for wildlife movement between Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia.\n\n=== Flora ===\nTypical trees include Zambezi teak (''[[Baikiaea plurijuga]]''), wild seringa (''[[Burkea africana]]''), African teak (''[[Pterocarpus angolensis]]''), manketti (''Schinziophyton rautanenii''), false mopane (''[[Guibourtia coleosperma]]''), camelthorn tree (''[[Acacia erioloba]]''), jackalberry (''[[Diospyros mespiliformis]]'') and makalani palm (''[[Hyphaene petersiana]]'').<ref>Mannheimer, CA and Curtis, BA (eds) 2009. \"Le Roux and Muller Field Guide to the Trees and Shrubs of Namibia\". Windhoek: Macmillan Education Namibia</ref>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nSeveral rare large mammal and bird species are found in Bwabwata. Elephants regularly move between Namibia, Angola, Botswana and Zambia. Other species found are [[African buffalo|Cape buffalo]], [[hippopotamus]], [[roan antelope]], [[sable antelope]], [[tsessebe]], [[Chapman's zebra|zebra]], [[blue wildebeest|wildebeest]], [[common reedbuck]], [[red lechwe]], [[sitatunga]] and [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]].

Bwabwata is situated in the centre of the KaZa TFCA and forms a corridor for elephant movement from Botswana into Angola and Zambia.\n\n== Park management ==\nTo accommodate Bwabwata\u2019s resident people, the Namibian Government has adopted integrated park management. The park is zoned into core areas for conservation and farming. Three areas are designated for special protection and controlled tourism \u2013 Kwando ({{Convert|1345|km2}}), Buffalo ({{Convert|629|km2}}), and Mahango ({{Convert|245|km2}}). A large Multiple Use Area ({{Convert|4055|km2}}) is zoned for community-based tourism, trophy hunting, human settlement and farming.\n \nPark residents are mostly from the Khwe [[San people|San]] bushmen minority group. Most residents live in [[Omega, Namibia|Omega]] village in the central part of the park and several smaller settlements. Residents have formed the Kyaramacan Association to represent them. Kyaramacan manages income from tourism (the N\u01c1goabaca campsite and a small lodge), from trophy hunting and the sale of devil\u2019s claw (''[[Harpagophytum procumbens]]''), a plant sold internationally to reduce pain and fever. \n\nThe Namibian Government, through the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, works with local communities to manage Bwabwata National Park. A technical committee, consisting of representatives from other Government departments, conservancies, community forests and non-governmental organisations, advises the Minister of Environment and Tourism. Community game guards work with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism staff to prevent poaching.<ref>Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia. Bwabwata management plan (draft) 2011</ref>\n\n== Park development ==\nBwabwata is one of five national parks in north-eastern Namibia. It is managed as a unit with Mangetti, [[Khaudom National Park]], [[Mudumu National Park]] and Nkasa Rupara (formerly [[Mamili National Park]]).\n\nSince 2006, the ''NamParks'' Project (formerly BMM Parks Project), co-funded by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] through [[KfW]] has helped develop management and tourism plans and constructed new park offices and staff housing in Namibia\u2019s north-eastern parks, including Bwabwata. The Project has helped introduce park-friendly land-uses in the surrounding areas and collaborative management structures.\nManagement priorities include the conservation of important habitats, safeguarding corridors for regional wildlife migration; providing income for rural residents and developing tourism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Pages/BwabwataMudumu-Mamiliproject.aspx# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119220738/http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Pages/BwabwataMudumu-Mamiliproject.aspx# |archive-date=2014-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=Bwabwata National Park \n |publisher=Republic of Namibia - Ministry of Environment and Tourism \n |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20Park%20Profile.pdf \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68CkgwakM?url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20Park%20Profile.pdf \n |archivedate=2012-06-05 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of national parks of Namibia]]\n* [[Caprivi Region]]\n* [[Caprivi game park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.met.gov.na/national-parks/bwabwata-national-park/213/ Ministry of Wildlife, Forestry and Tourism] \n{{National Parks of Namibia}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:National parks of Namibia]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Namibia]]\n[[Category:Zambezi Region]]\n[[Category:Kavango East]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name = Bwabwata National Park\n| alt_name = \n| photo_alt = \n| photo_caption = \n| photo_width = \n| map = Namibia |relief=1\n| map_alt = \n| map_caption = Map of [[Namibia]]\n| map_width = \n| location = Northeast [[Namibia]]\n| nearest_town = Rundu, Katima Mulilo\n| coordinates = {{coords|-17.95|22.54|region:NA|notes=<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Caprivi_game_park |title=Caprivi Game Park |work=protectedplanet.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913143635/http://protectedplanet.net/sites/Caprivi_Game_Park |archivedate=2012-09-13 }}</ref>|display=inline, title}}\n| area = {{Convert|6274|km2|abbr=on}}\n| established = 2007\n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body = [[Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia]]\n| world_heritage_site = \n| url = \n| photo = Loxodonta africana MS 10093s.jpg\n}}\n\n'''Bwabwata National Park''' is a [[protected area]] in northeastern [[Namibia]] that was established in 2007 and covers {{Convert|6274|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.
