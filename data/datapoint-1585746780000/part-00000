{"title_page": "Blunder (chess)", "text_new": "In [[chess]], a '''blunder''' is a very bad move. It is usually caused by some tactical oversight, whether from [[time trouble]], overconfidence or carelessness. While a blunder may seem like a stroke of luck for the opposing player, some chess players give their opponent plenty of opportunities to blunder.\n\nWhat qualifies as a \"blunder\" rather than a normal mistake is somewhat subjective. A weak move from a novice player might be explained by the player's lack of skill, while the same move from a master might be called a blunder. In [[punctuation (chess)|chess annotation]], blunders are typically marked with a double question mark, \"{{chesspunc|??}}\", after the move.\n\nEspecially among amateur and novice players, blunders often occur because of a faulty thought process where they do not consider the opponent's {{chessgloss|forcing moves}}. In particular, [[Check (chess)|checks]], {{chessgloss|captures}}, and {{chessgloss|threats}} need to be considered at each move. Neglecting these possibilities leaves a player vulnerable to simple tactical errors.<ref>The principle of looking for checks, captures, and threats is repeated often by [[Dan Heisman]], see e.g. {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman14.pdf|title=A Generic Thought Process|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=March 2002|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman65.pdf|title=Is It Safe?|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=June 2006|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOne technique formerly recommended to avoid blunders was to write down the planned move on the {{chessgloss|score sheet}}, then take one last look before making it.<ref>\"When you have finished analyzing all the variations and gone along all the branches of the tree of analysis you must first of all write the move down on your score sheet, before you play it.\" [[Alexander Kotov]], ''Think Like a Grandmaster'', Chess Digest, 1971, pp. 73\u201374.</ref><ref>[[Simon Webb (chess player)|Simon Webb]], ''Chess for Tigers'' (3rd ed. 2005), pp. 121\u201322.</ref> This practice was not uncommon even at the [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] level.<ref>Webb wrote of the practice, \"You've seen other players doing it\".

In fact, [[David Bronstein|Bronstein]] (playing Black) has for the last seven moves been making only apparently aimless knight moves, Nc6\u2013d4\u2013c6\u2013d4, and now has played ...Nd4\u2013f5, threatening White's queen, while White has been slowly strengthening his position.

In the diagram position, Chandler is completely winning. His opponent, [[Susan Polgar]], played the wily trap 53...Ng8\u2013h6{{chesspunc|!?}}. Chandler realized that after 54.gxh6+ Kxh6 he will be left with the considerable {{chessgloss|material}} advantage of a {{chessgloss|rook pawn}} and [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] against a [[bare king]]. However, since the bishop is unable to control the [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] square h8, Black will draw if she is able to get her king to control h8 due to the [[wrong rook pawn]] [[fortress (chess)|fortress]]. But Chandler calculates further, and realizes that it is ''he'' who will win control over the h8 square after 55.Kf6, and thereby win the game.<ref>[[Andrew Soltis]], ''Chess to Enjoy'' in September 1997 ''[[Chess Life]]''</ref>\n\nTherefore, Chandler played '''54. gxh6+??''', but instead of the expected 54...Kxh6 came 54...Kh8! This is in fact almost the same king, bishop, and rook pawn versus bare king situation as Chandler had calculated that he would avoid, and the small difference that White has ''two'' rook pawns rather than one has no effect on the result. Black controls the h8 square and cannot be chased or squeezed away from it, and so White cannot promote his pawn. After 55.Bd5 Kh7 56.Kf7 Kh8 the players [[draw by agreement|agreed to a draw]].\n\nChandler had numerous moves that would have maintained his winning position, the fastest according to the Shredder [[tablebase]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shredderchess.com/online-chess/online-databases/endgame-database.html|title=Shredder Computer Chess Download - Endgame Database|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> are 54.h4 and 54.Bf5.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Alexander Beliavsky vs. Leif Erlend Johannessen===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tleft\n| \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|  |kd\n|  |  |pd|  |  |  |pd|  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |pl|ql|pd\n|  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |pl\n|  |  |  |  |pl|pl|kl|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |qd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to make his 69th move \n}}\nThis example, from a game played in [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] in 2002, is one of the very rare circumstances where a grandmaster makes the worst move possible, the only one allowing [[checkmate]] on the next move.

Kramnik's troubles began when he decided to play for a win and pushed his a-pawn, 31...a4.

At least one audio commentator also noticed nothing, while Fritz operator [[Mathias Feist]] kept glancing from the board to the screen and back, hardly able to believe that he had input the correct move.

It is usually caused by some tactical oversight, whether from [[time trouble]], overconfidence or carelessness. While a blunder may seem like a stroke of luck for the opposing player, some chess players give their opponent plenty of opportunities to blunder.\n\nWhat qualifies as a \"blunder\" rather than a normal mistake is somewhat subjective. A weak move from a novice player might be explained by the player's lack of skill, while the same move from a master might be called a blunder. In [[punctuation (chess)|chess annotation]], blunders are typically marked with a double question mark, \"{{chesspunc|??}}\", after the move.\n\nEspecially among amateur and novice players, blunders often occur because of a faulty thought process where they do not consider the opponent's {{chessgloss|forcing moves}}. In particular, [[Check (chess)|checks]], {{chessgloss|captures}}, and {{chessgloss|threats}} need to be considered at each move. Neglecting these possibilities leaves a player vulnerable to simple tactical errors.<ref>The principle of looking for checks, captures, and threats is repeated often by [[Dan Heisman]], see e.g. {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman14.pdf|title=A Generic Thought Process|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=March 2002|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman65.pdf|title=Is It Safe?|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=June 2006|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOne technique formerly recommended to avoid blunders was to write down the planned move on the {{chessgloss|score sheet}}, then take one last look before making it.<ref>\"When you have finished analyzing all the variations and gone along all the branches of the tree of analysis you must first of all write the move down on your score sheet, before you play it.\" [[Alexander Kotov]], ''Think Like a Grandmaster'', Chess Digest, 1971, pp. 73\u201374.</ref><ref>[[Simon Webb (chess player)|Simon Webb]], ''Chess for Tigers'' (3rd ed. 2005), pp. 121\u201322.</ref> This practice was not uncommon even at the [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] level.<ref>Webb wrote of the practice, \"You've seen other players doing it\".

In the diagram position, Chandler is completely winning. His opponent, [[Susan Polgar]], played the wily trap 53...Ng8\u2013h6{{chesspunc|!?}}. Chandler realized that after 54.gxh6+ Kxh6 he will be left with the considerable {{chessgloss|material}} advantage of a {{chessgloss|rook pawn}} and [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] against a [[bare king]]. However, since the bishop is unable to control the [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] square h8, Black will draw if she is able to get her king to control h8 due to the [[wrong rook pawn]] [[fortress (chess)|fortress]]. But Chandler calculates further, and realizes that it is ''he'' who will win control over the h8 square after 55.Kf6, and thereby win the game.<ref>[[Andrew Soltis]], ''Chess to Enjoy'' in September 1997 ''[[Chess Life]]''</ref>\n\nTherefore, Chandler played '''54. gxh6+??''', but instead of the expected 54...Kxh6 came 54...Kh8! This is in fact almost the same king, bishop, and rook pawn versus bare king situation as Chandler had calculated that he would avoid, and the small difference that White has ''two'' rook pawns rather than one has no effect on the result. Black controls the h8 square and cannot be chased or squeezed away from it, and so White cannot promote his pawn.
