{"title_page": "Cuba under Fidel Castro", "text_new": "Under the \u018fule of [[Fidel Castro]], the nation of [[Cuba]] underwent significant economic, political, and social changes. In the [[Cuban Revolution]], Castro and an associated group of revolutionaries toppled the ruling government of [[Fulgencio Batista]], forcing Batista out of power on 1 January 1959. Castro, who had already been an important figure in Cuban society, went on to serve as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] from 1959 to 1976. He was also the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], the most senior position in the [[Communist state]] from 1961 to 2011. In 1976, Castro officially became [[President of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of State (Cuba)|Council of State]] and [[Prime Minister of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Council of Ministers]]. He retained the title until 2008, when the presidency was transferred to his brother, [[Ra\u00fal Castro]], but retained his position of Party First Secretary until 2011.\n\nFidel Castro's staunch belief in a [[Communism|communist ideology]] and his criticisms of other international figures elevated the prominence of his rule. He launched a wide range of economic and social changes. Castro's Cuba became a key element within the [[Cold War]] struggle between the [[United States]] and its allies versus the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Events such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, in which American-connected forces failed to topple Castro's administration, continue to attract attention from historians as well as laypeople worldwide.\n\nCastro died of natural causes in late 2016 in [[Havana]]. He had dealt with severe health problems for the past decade, remarking publicly about struggles with mobility and other issues. Even after his death, Castro's ideas continue to be the foundation of Cuban government.\n\n=={{vanchor|Premiership}} 1959\u20131976==\n===Consolidating leadership: 1959===\n[[Image:Fidel Castro - MATS Terminal Washington 1959.jpg|thumb|Castro is seen in [[Washington, D.C.]], arriving at the MATS Terminal, in April 1959.]]\n\nOn February 16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]], and accepted the position on the condition that the Prime Minister's powers be increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=173}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=228}}.</ref> Between 15 and 26 April Castro visited the U.S. with a delegation of representatives, hired a [[public relations]] firm for a [[charm offensive]], and presented himself as a \"man of the people\".

He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds.

Angolan President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola.

In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalised in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratisation was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 276&ndash;281, 284, 287.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 291&ndash;294.</ref>\n\nCastro's government decided to diversify its economy into [[biotechnology]] and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 288.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 290, 322.</ref> The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on [[prostitution in Cuba]], fearing a political backlash.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 294.</ref> Economic hardship led many Cubans to turn towards religion, both in the forms of [[Roman Catholicism]] and the syncretic faith of [[Santeria]].

In the [[Cuban Revolution]], Castro and an associated group of revolutionaries toppled the ruling government of [[Fulgencio Batista]], forcing Batista out of power on 1 January 1959. Castro, who had already been an important figure in Cuban society, went on to serve as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] from 1959 to 1976. He was also the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], the most senior position in the [[Communist state]] from 1961 to 2011. In 1976, Castro officially became [[President of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of State (Cuba)|Council of State]] and [[Prime Minister of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Council of Ministers]]. He retained the title until 2008, when the presidency was transferred to his brother, [[Ra\u00fal Castro]], but retained his position of Party First Secretary until 2011.\n\nFidel Castro's staunch belief in a [[Communism|communist ideology]] and his criticisms of other international figures elevated the prominence of his rule. He launched a wide range of economic and social changes. Castro's Cuba became a key element within the [[Cold War]] struggle between the [[United States]] and its allies versus the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Events such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, in which American-connected forces failed to topple Castro's administration, continue to attract attention from historians as well as laypeople worldwide.\n\nCastro died of natural causes in late 2016 in [[Havana]]. He had dealt with severe health problems for the past decade, remarking publicly about struggles with mobility and other issues. Even after his death, Castro's ideas continue to be the foundation of Cuban government.\n\n=={{vanchor|Premiership}} 1959\u20131976==\n===Consolidating leadership: 1959===\n[[Image:Fidel Castro - MATS Terminal Washington 1959.jpg|thumb|Castro is seen in [[Washington, D.C.]], arriving at the MATS Terminal, in April 1959.]]\n\nOn February 16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]], and accepted the position on the condition that the Prime Minister's powers be increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=173}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=228}}.</ref> Between 15 and 26 April Castro visited the U.S. with a delegation of representatives, hired a [[public relations]] firm for a [[charm offensive]], and presented himself as a \"man of the people\".

He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke the control of the well-off landowning class over Cuba's agriculture.

Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola.

In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalised in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratisation was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 276&ndash;281, 284, 287.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 291&ndash;294.</ref>\n\nCastro's government decided to diversify its economy into [[biotechnology]] and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 288.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 290, 322.</ref> The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on [[prostitution in Cuba]], fearing a political backlash.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 294.</ref> Economic hardship led many Cubans to turn towards religion, both in the forms of [[Roman Catholicism]] and the syncretic faith of [[Santeria]].
