The specialized exposition themed \"Energy Turns the World,\" was recognized by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE).\n\nIt opened on May 1, 1982, and closed on October 31, 1982, after receiving over eleven-million visitors. Participating nations included Australia, Belgium, Canada, The People's Republic of China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany.\n\nThe fair was constructed on a {{convert|70|acre|m2|adj=on}} site between Downtown Knoxville and the [[University of Tennessee]] campus. The core of the site primarily consisted of a deteriorating [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] yard and [[L&N Station (Knoxville)|depot]]. The railroad yard was demolished, with the exception of a single rail line, and the depot was renovated for use as a restaurant during the fair. The [[Sunsphere]], a {{convert|266|ft|m|adj=on}} steel tower topped with a five-story gold globe, was built as the main structure and symbol for the exposition. Today, the Sunsphere stands as a symbol for the city of Knoxville.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:102 0459.JPG|thumb|left|The Sunsphere]]\nKnoxville developers cultivated the idea for a [[World's Fair]] in the city after the example of [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which [[Expo '74|hosted a World's Fair]] in 1974.  W. Stewart Evans, president of the [[Downtown Knoxville]] Association, proposed the idea of the fair to the city government.<ref name=tenn/>\n\nKnoxville Mayor [[Kyle Testerman]] appointed local banker [[Jake Butcher]] to lead an exploratory committee. Butcher served as one of the main driving forces behind the fair.

It had developed structural problems that could not be safely resolved after years of neglection. The site of the pavilion was cleared and developed for a parking lot along Cumberland Avenue,<ref>\"Report on Demolition of US Pavilion\", News 8, April 1991.</ref> adjacent to the site of the [[Knoxville Convention Center]] in [[World's Fair Park]].\n\nThe site of the Korean and Saudi Arabian pavilions and the Tennessee Gas Industries exhibit was converted into a performance lawn, and was host to a regular concert series for eight years. The site of the Japanese Pavilion became the new location for the [[Knoxville Museum of Art]].  The Elm Tree Theater located adjacent to the former pavilion was added as part of the Knoxville Museum of Art's courtyard.  The elm tree was later struck by lightning and was cut down. The courtyard of the theater has since remained empty. Many of the pavilion sites and the fair's midway located south of the main park were given to the [[University of Tennessee]] for future campus extensions and student parking.\n\nIn 1996, Knoxville and the 1982 World's Fair were featured prominently in the episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[Bart on the Road]]\". In the episode, Bart and his friends travel to Knoxville to visit the fair after seeing an advertisement in an tourism brochure, only to learn that it closed a decade before. The episode ends with one of the characters throwing a stone at the Sunsphere, causing it to collapse on a car that the group had rented.\n\nIn 2000, the park was closed for two years for the construction of the  Knoxville Convention Center in the space formerly occupied by Rich's/Millers Garage, the site of the KUB Substation exhibit, and the site of America's Electric Energy Exhibit.\n\nThe [[Tennessee Amphitheater]], the only structure other than the Sunsphere that remains from the World's Fair, was condemned to demolition in 2002.<ref>{{cite news | author=Doug Mason | title=Professor sings praises of iconic World's Fair structure | url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/professor-sings-praises-of-iconic-worlds-fair-structure-ep-413259808-360375381.html | work=The [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] | date=18 September 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819211310/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/professor-sings-praises-of-iconic-worlds-fair-structure-ep-413259808-360375381.html | archivedate=August 19, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Popular sentiment supported restoring it, and the theater was renovated between 2005 and 2007, reopening in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|title=World's Fair Park Amphitheater|url=http://www.worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-amphitheater.html|publisher=World's Fair Park|accessdate=2016-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064357/http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-amphitheater.html|archive-date=June 30, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2007, the amphitheater was voted one of the top fifteen architectural works of East Tennessee by the East Tennessee chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Doug Mason| title=Area architects' picks for ET's Top 15 structures may surprise you | url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/area-architects-picks-for-ets-top-15-structures-may-surprise-you-ep-412345379-360064881.html | work=The [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] | date=16 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2002, the World's Fair Park was reopened to general events and concerts, such as Earth Fest and [[Greek Fest]].  A [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration is held on the park lawns every year, with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra playing a free concert with a massive fireworks display. In May 2007, the [[East Tennessee Historical Society]] opened an temporary exhibit in its museum located in Downtown Knoxville, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the World's Fair. On July 4, 2007, one of the annual celebrations was held in conjunction with festivities commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the 1982 World's Fair. The following day, July 5, 2007, the Sunsphere's observation deck reopened to the public after renovations.\n\n==Collectibles==\nMany collectible items were made specifically for the World's Fair, ranging from cups, trays, plates, belt buckles, and several other objects.  Some of the more notable items include:\n\n* With the focus of the World's Fair on technology and energy, video games of the era were also featured at the Fair.  In the arcade area, attendees could find seven [[video arcade game]] tokens that had been minted for the Fair, each depicting a different and popular game of the time. The seven games on each of the tokens are ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Qix]]'', ''[[Gorf]]'', ''[[Scramble (arcade game)|Scramble]]'', and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref>Video Game Arcade Token Gallery, [http://digthatbox.com/arcade_token_gallery.html Arcade Token Gallery ], ''[[digthatbox.com]]'', October 9, 2014</ref>\n* A special [[Coca-Cola]] pin was given to 500 dignitaries on opening day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n* ''Worlds Fair Beer'' was also released at the beginning of the fair. 250,000 cases of the beer was sold during the fair's duration, totaling nearly six-million cans sold over the six months. Rick Kuhlman, who was a marketing director for a beer wholesaler at the time, had come up with the idea for the beer.  He had to pre-sell 10,000 cases of the beer to pay for the initial batch.  The beer would go on to be released in nine different colored cans, beginning with red, then blue, and eventually, green, brown, gold, black, purple, yellow, and orange.  Each color represented its own production batch and when a color was sold out, that color was finished.  The beer was often purchased and never drank, as many fair-goers speculated that the beer cans would one day be a rare collectible.<ref>[http://archive.knoxnews.com/entertainment/life/thirty-years-later-knoxvillians-celebrate-1982-energy-expo-ep-360866163-357040481.html Thirty years later, Knoxvillians celebrate 1982 energy expo]</ref> To observe the 35th anniversary of the fair, World's Fair Beer was brought back into production in May 2017 and is available at various bars and breweries around Knoxville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2017/05/01/relaunch-worlds-fair-beer-on-sale-again/101166904/|title= Relaunch: World's Fair Beer on sale again|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\" perrow=5 mode=packed>\nFile:Australian Pavilion.jpg|Australian Pavilion\nFile:Baptist Pavilion & Pond.jpg|Baptist Pavilion and Waters of the World\nFile:People's Republic of China Exhibit- Rug with Temple of Heaven.jpg|People's Republic of China Pavilion exhibit\nFile:Sunsphere 02.jpg|Sunsphere\nFile:Sunsphere View of Tennessee River & Amusement Area.jpg|Tennessee River, Australian and Canadian Pavilions and Midway\nFile:Sunsphere View of US Pavilion.jpg|U.S. Pavilion\nFile:Tennessee Ampitheatre.jpg|Tennessee Amphitheater\nFile:US Pavilion.jpg|KUB Substation Exhibit and U.S. Pavilion\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of world's fairs]]\n* [[National Conservation Exposition]]\n\n{{Portal bar|United States}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070509002102/http://users.vnet.net/schulman/1982/fair.html 1982 World's Fair Research Site], by Bruce Schulman\n* [http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/1982-knoxville Official website of the BIE]\n* [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/2016/etc/se4/p219.html European Patent Office]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090417055229/http://1982worldsfair.com/ 1982 World's Fair 25th Anniversary site (archived)]\n* [http://www.expomuseum.com/1982/ ExpoMuseum's 1982 World's Fair Section]\n<!--* [http://www.administradoc.com/info/expo-1982-Knoxville.html Expo Knoxville 1982 ]-->\n\n{{List of world's fairs in the United States}}\n{{List of world exhibitions}}\n{{Tennessee}}\n\n[[Category:World's fairs in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:1982 festivals|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:1982 in Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Knoxville, Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:Culture of Knoxville, Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:History of Knoxville, Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox World's Fair\n| box_width       = \n| class           = Specialized\n| category        = 2\n| image           = 150px-1982WorldsFair.png\n| image_width     = 149px\n| caption         = The 1982 World's Fair logo\n| year            = 1982\n| name            = Knoxville International Energy Exposition\n| motto           = \"Energy Turns the World\"\n| building        = Sunsphere\n| area            = {{convert|28|ha|acre|abbr=off}}\n| invent          = \n| visitors        = 11,127,786 \n| organized       = \n| cnt             = 16\n| org             = \n| biz             = \n| country         = United States\n| city            = [[Knoxville]]\n| venue           = [[World's Fair Park]]\n| coord           = {{Coord|35.962|-83.924|region:US-TN_type:event|display=title, inline}}\n| cand            = \n| award           = \n| open            = {{start date|1982|05|01}} \n| close           = {{start date|1982|10|31}}\n| prevexpo        = [[Expo 81]]\n| prevcity        = [[Plovdiv]]\n| nextexpo        = [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]]\n| nextcity        = [[New Orleans]]\n| suppl           = \n| prevsuppl       = [[Expo '70]] \n| prevsupcity     = [[Osaka]] \n| nextsuppl       = [[Seville Expo '92]] \n| nextsupcity     = [[Seville]] \n| prevunho        = [[Floralies Internationales de Montr\u00e9al]]\n| prevunhocity    = [[Montreal]]\n| nextunho        = [[International Garden Expo 83|Internationale Gartenbauaustellung 83]]\n| nextunhocity    = [[Munich]]\n| simuni          = \n| simspe          = \n| simhor          = [[Florida 1982]]\n| simoth          = \n| website         =  \n}}\n\nThe '''1982 World's Fair''', formally known as the '''Knoxville International Energy Exposition''', was held in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]], [[United States]].

The [[Sunsphere]], a {{convert|266|ft|m|adj=on}} steel tower topped with a five-story gold globe, was built as the main structure and symbol for the exposition. Today, the Sunsphere stands as a symbol for the city of Knoxville.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:102 0459.JPG|thumb|left|The Sunsphere]]\nKnoxville developers cultivated the idea for a [[World's Fair]] in the city after the example of [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which [[Expo '74|hosted a World's Fair]] in 1974.  W. Stewart Evans, president of the [[Downtown Knoxville]] Association, proposed the idea of the fair to the city government.<ref name=tenn/>\n\nKnoxville Mayor [[Kyle Testerman]] appointed local banker [[Jake Butcher]] to lead an exploratory committee.

It had developed structural problems that could not be safely resolved after years of neglection. The site of the pavilion was cleared and developed for a parking lot along Cumberland Avenue,<ref>\"Report on Demolition of US Pavilion\", News 8, April 1991.</ref> adjacent to the site of the [[Knoxville Convention Center]] in [[World's Fair Park]].\n\nThe site of the Korean and Saudi Arabian pavilions and the Tennessee Gas Industries exhibit was converted into a performance lawn, and was host to a regular concert series for eight years. The site of the Japanese Pavilion became the new location for the [[Knoxville Museum of Art]].  The Elm Tree Theater located adjacent to the former pavilion was added as part of the Knoxville Museum of Art's courtyard.  The elm tree was later struck by lightning and was cut down. The courtyard of the theater has since remained empty. Many of the pavilion sites and the fair's midway located south of the main park were given to the [[University of Tennessee]] for future campus extensions and student parking.\n\nIn 1996, Knoxville and the 1982 World's Fair were featured prominently in the episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[Bart on the Road]]\". In the episode, Bart and his friends travel to Knoxville to visit the fair after seeing an advertisement in an tourism brochure, only to learn that it closed a decade before. The episode ends with one of the characters throwing a stone at the Sunsphere, causing it to collapse on a car that the group had rented.\n\nIn 2000, the park was closed for two years for the construction of the  Knoxville Convention Center in the space formerly occupied by Rich's/Millers Garage, the site of the KUB Substation exhibit, and the site of America's Electric Energy Exhibit.\n\nThe [[Tennessee Amphitheater]], the only structure other than the Sunsphere that remains from the World's Fair, was condemned to demolition in 2002.<ref>{{cite news | author=Doug Mason | title=Professor sings praises of iconic World's Fair structure | url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/professor-sings-praises-of-iconic-worlds-fair-structure-ep-413259808-360375381.html | work=The [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] | date=18 September 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819211310/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/professor-sings-praises-of-iconic-worlds-fair-structure-ep-413259808-360375381.html | archivedate=August 19, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Popular sentiment supported restoring it, and the theater was renovated between 2005 and 2007, reopening in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|title=World's Fair Park Amphitheater|url=http://www.worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-amphitheater.html|publisher=World's Fair Park|accessdate=2016-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064357/http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-amphitheater.html|archive-date=June 30, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2007, the amphitheater was voted one of the top fifteen architectural works of East Tennessee by the East Tennessee chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Doug Mason| title=Area architects' picks for ET's Top 15 structures may surprise you | url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/area-architects-picks-for-ets-top-15-structures-may-surprise-you-ep-412345379-360064881.html | work=The [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] | date=16 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2002, the World's Fair Park was reopened to general events and concerts, such as Earth Fest and [[Greek Fest]].  A [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration is held on the park lawns every year, with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra playing a free concert with a massive fireworks display. In May of 2007, the [[East Tennessee Historical Society]] opened an temporary exhibit in its museum located in Downtown Knoxville, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the World's Fair. On July 4, 2007, one of the annual celebrations was held in conjunction with festivities commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the 1982 World's Fair. The following day, July 5, 2007, the Sunsphere's observation deck reopened to the public after renovations.\n\n==Collectibles==\nMany collectible items were made specifically for the World's Fair, ranging from cups, trays, plates, belt buckles, and several other objects.  Some of the more notable items include:\n\n* With the focus of the World's Fair on technology and energy, video games of the era were also featured at the Fair.  In the arcade area, attendees could find seven [[video arcade game]] tokens that had been minted for the Fair, each depicting a different and popular game of the time. The seven games on each of the tokens are ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Qix]]'', ''[[Gorf]]'', ''[[Scramble (arcade game)|Scramble]]'', and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref>Video Game Arcade Token Gallery, [http://digthatbox.com/arcade_token_gallery.html Arcade Token Gallery ], ''[[digthatbox.com]]'', October 9, 2014</ref>\n* A special [[Coca-Cola]] pin was given to 500 dignitaries on opening day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n* ''Worlds Fair Beer'' was also released at the beginning of the fair. 250,000 cases of the beer was sold during the fair's duration, totaling nearly six-million cans sold over the six months. Rick Kuhlman, who was a marketing director for a beer wholesaler at the time, had come up with the idea for the beer.  He had to pre-sell 10,000 cases of the beer to pay for the initial batch.  The beer would go on to be released in nine different colored cans, beginning with red, then blue, and eventually, green, brown, gold, black, purple, yellow, and orange.  Each color represented its own production batch and when a color was sold out, that color was finished.  The beer was often purchased and never drank, as many fair-goers speculated that the beer cans would one day be a rare collectible.<ref>[http://archive.knoxnews.com/entertainment/life/thirty-years-later-knoxvillians-celebrate-1982-energy-expo-ep-360866163-357040481.html Thirty years later, Knoxvillians celebrate 1982 energy expo]</ref> To observe the 35th anniversary of the fair, World's Fair Beer was brought back into production in May of 2017 and is available at various bars and breweries around Knoxville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2017/05/01/relaunch-worlds-fair-beer-on-sale-again/101166904/|title= Relaunch: World's Fair Beer on sale again|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\" perrow=5 mode=packed>\nFile:Australian Pavilion.jpg|Australian Pavilion\nFile:Baptist Pavilion & Pond.jpg|Baptist Pavilion and Waters of the World\nFile:People's Republic of China Exhibit- Rug with Temple of Heaven.jpg|People's Republic of China Pavilion exhibit\nFile:Sunsphere 02.jpg|Sunsphere\nFile:Sunsphere View of Tennessee River & Amusement Area.jpg|Tennessee River, Austrailian and Canadian Pavilions and Midway\nFile:Sunsphere View of US Pavilion.jpg|U.S. Pavilion\nFile:Tennessee Ampitheatre.jpg|Tennessee Amphitheater\nFile:US Pavilion.jpg|KUB Substation Exhibit and U.S. Pavilion\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of world's fairs]]\n* [[National Conservation Exposition]]\n\n{{Portal bar|United States}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070509002102/http://users.vnet.net/schulman/1982/fair.html 1982 World's Fair Research Site], by Bruce Schulman\n* [http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/1982-knoxville Official website of the BIE]\n* [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/2016/etc/se4/p219.html European Patent Office]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090417055229/http://1982worldsfair.com/ 1982 World's Fair 25th Anniversary site (archived)]\n* [http://www.expomuseum.com/1982/ ExpoMuseum's 1982 World's Fair Section]\n<!--* [http://www.administradoc.com/info/expo-1982-Knoxville.html Expo Knoxville 1982 ]-->\n\n{{List of world's fairs in the United States}}\n{{List of world exhibitions}}\n{{Tennessee}}\n\n[[Category:World's fairs in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:1982 festivals|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:1982 in Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Knoxville, Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:Culture of Knoxville, Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:History of Knoxville, Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Tennessee|World's Fair]]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: Austrailian \u2192 Australian", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World%27s_Fair"}
